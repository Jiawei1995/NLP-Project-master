i bought few bags these noodles after reading very favorable review them hungry girl website , i am glad i . they work well number different recipes , filling , add " calcium boost " dishes i use them , very few calories . these not " pasta " type noodles , course - texture different ( softer kind " slippery " ) , they virtually no flavor their own - they take flavor whatever sauce or dressing you use them . i probably won't use these noodles european-style or american-style sauces such marinara or cheese sauce - those types sauces created grain-based pastas , which these not . other hand , these noodles fine such asian recipes pad thai , lo mein dan-dan noodes ( basically , noodles spicy peanut or sesame sauce ) . there lot asian-style recipes cookbooks internet which fairly easy make , taste terrific , work beautifully these noodles . you prepare yourself real treat , if you use these noodles types recipes work well their texture , fraction calories you'd eat if using regular noodles or rice . short , if you attempt something like spaghetti meatballs or chicken cacciatore using these noodles , you're likely disappointed , but if you use them pad thai , any type curry , other asian dishes , or most soups , you're likely find yourself enjoying delicious wonderfully low-cal , low-carb meal . one thing - when you open bag , there slight ammonia-like odor ( it smells ammonia-like me , anyway ) . if you rinse noodles well then parboil them few minutes , per package directions , odor really disappear . it not strong odor , it won't permeate your kitchen or anything like , but you definitely want rinse parboil noodles before using them . just follow package directions	-1

" their web site , tazo describes flavor profile lotus " peach , nutty , flowery , overripe melon . this surprisingly full-flavored yet delicately floral blend clean light-bodied , aroma reminiscent freesia . " tazo also describes aroma " tropical fruit , green tea " . hmmm ... i don't taste all these various flavors , i suspect tazo really pushes creative writing limit . i taste green tea , nice flowery flavor , which i'm assuming lotus , but not res t---t he peach , nuts , melon , freesia , tropical fruit---they're missing what i discern here . i would rate this tea , tazo general , good --- better than premium teas like stash or celestial seasonings --- but not good numi . i'm soooooo spoiled numi teas , which why tazo lotus gets only four stars . ***	-1

those us brought up vegemite , marmite doesn't make grade . those brought up marmite , vegemite seems poor substitute . americans who only seem put sweet stuff their cake ( oops , i mean " bread " ) both revolting . i think major reason why americans abhor these savoury spreads used spreading honey jam their breakfast toast , they tend use like quantities vegemite or marmite . uninitiated taste either spread applied so lavishly going overwhelming . before passing judgment these spreads , you would well heed advice " joanna " or " mtspace " apply thinly . it also works best very fresh bread or hot toast . incidentally , i believe marmite first . vegemite australian imitation created several years later . it originally called parwill - pun which appreciated aussies brits but which may not understood americans because way words pronounced . i only give marmite four stars . probably tells you my upbringing	-1

( once drink name started roll my kids ' tongues easily - i realized i spending too much money these drinks - daily ! )i am not familiar various grades matcha , but not want something pre-sweetened or modified because i wanted control sugar , etc . i make my frappuccino like this : sorry - i not measure - so you may modify these amounts because i am guessing ! 1 1/2c milk2 heaping spoonfuls ( spoon that included ) green tea powder1/8c simple syrup ( i make it myself keep fridge week or so)10+ice cubes ( adjust your taste - depends size cubes)blend this blender - longer than you think - pulse first then blend bit - i scrape down bit bc powder flies around little you don't want lose any . ( simple syrup 1c water , 1c sugar heated until sugar dissolves ) it much easier than it may sound - i make these daily morning . i hope this helps anyone else out there who addicted gt frappuccino - it slightly different ( i think they use different gt powder honeydew syrup ) , but i liked mine more within first week them !	1

i personally love crunchy cheetos , but if you look nutrition facts they're not really healthy . i love crunch cheesiness . everything cheetos great , i even love lick cheese off my fingers . although fat , salt , calorie , carbohyrdrate content extremely terrible , package may say 100% real chese , but its 100% real fake cheese . it like everyone loves chocolate , but it unhealthy . i don't advise you buy these snacks when you eat something healthier , perhaps bag low sodium pretzels or piece fruit . i think you should definintely eat cheetos least once while because they taste delicious , just not all time . i don't want sound like paranoid health inspector , i'm just giving you my personal opinion this product ! i lt ;3 cheetos	-1

**** tazo lotus decaffeinated green tea one my favorite tazo teas . lotus flower flavor pleasant delightful . this tea not bitter or harsh any way . it one most natural-tasting tazo i've tasted , very subtle , much less artificial-tasting . ingredients lotus : naturally decaffeinated green tea , natural lotus flower flavor other natural flavors . course , this tea caffeine-free . tazo interesting company makes only super premium teas . they socially responsible , based portland , motto , " reincarnation tea " . tazo owned starbucks . their web site fun quirky , zen-type focus , definitely worth checking out . it unclear , though , their web site , how many their ingredients organic or kosher , they use some " natural flavors " their teas -- this wording seems little vague super premium tea . paper tea packet , tazo writes , " delightfully subtle green tea inner radiance essence lotus flower . " their web site , tazo describes flavor profile lotus " peach , nutty , flowery , overripe melon . this surprisingly full-flavored yet delicately floral blend clean light-bodied , aroma reminiscent freesia . " tazo also describes aroma " tropical fruit , green tea " . hmmm ... i don't taste all these various flavors , i suspect tazo really pushes creative writing limit . i taste green tea , nice flowery flavor , which i'm assuming lotus , but not res t---t he peach , nuts , melon , freesia , tropical fruit---they're missing what i discern here . i would rate this tea , tazo general , good --- better than premium teas like stash or celestial seasonings --- but not good numi . i'm soooooo spoiled numi teas , which why tazo lotus gets only four stars . ***	-1

twinkies rank high my list pure junk foods . sugar corn syrup twinkies help push calorie count around 150 . i not care think what kind fats carbs go 150 calories . other hand , i grew up twinkies . i used eat them fast i could get my hands them . unfortunately , i am unable any more . you get older , you get smarter , i guess . but i still like occasional twinkie . yes , they sweet . yes , they too many calories . but , they taste good ! i wish they still offered banana creme twinkies . more recently people actually enhanced calories twinkie deep frying them . cooking twinkie should something you only great care . there process successfully making deep fried twinkie , there many processes not work . best my knowledge all processes yield even more calories , but even better flavor . you get general idea . better twinkies taste , more calories they . go figure . twinkies their current form never mistaken health food . but i probably continue indulge one periodically long i . enjoy !	-1

**** tazo calm herbal infusion nice chamomile tea . i taste chamomile some flavorings , they not unpleasant , just hard pin down what they besides chamomile . general i'm not big fan tea flavorings added , preferring subtleness authentic taste real thing . ingredients calm : chamomile flowers , hibiscus flowers , spearmint , lemongrass , rose petals , blackberry leaves , safflowers , peppermint , sarsaparilla , lemon balm , licorice natural flavors . it caffeine-free ! tazo interesting company makes only super premium teas . they socially responsible , based portland , motto , " reincarnation tea " . tazo owned starbucks . their web site fun quirky , zen-type focus , definitely worth checking out . it unclear , though , their web site , how many their ingredients organic or kosher , they use some " natural flavors " their teas -- this wording seems little vague super premium tea . paper tea packet , tazo writes , " soothing blend chamomile blossoms other relaxing herbs . " their web site , tazo describes flavor profile calm " creamy , floral , minty , toasty , sweet , honey-like . name gently implies , tazo calm lovely floral bouquet apple-like flavor distinct toasty notes . naturally sweet nice light way , smooth finish " . tazo describes aroma " minty , hay like , rose " . i don't taste all these various flavors , but i taste chamomile , it fine , not overwhelming or artificial tasting several other tazo teas i've sampled . i would rate this tea , tazo general , good --- better than premium teas like stash or celestial seasonings --- but not good numi . i'm soooooo spoiled numi teas , which why tazo calm gets only four stars . ***	-1

try this i am sure you like flovor . my family all texas . since i wee little tyke ( 60 years ago ) i remember my grandmother , effie , cooking gebhardt chili powder . nothing else would since effie ( who known all grannie ) taught my mom how cook ; gebhardt only chili powder any us would every use . okay , okay , so i try cut costs sometimes when i younger bought grocery store chili powders but taste definitely not same it seemed things cooked mess not edible either . i wish they would sell gebhardt bigger bottle because i usually 3 or 4 bottles my cupboard i am scared running out when i am middle cooking something great like red beans rice , or grannie mexican skillet , tamale pie , chili , red eye stew , stuffed peppes , omlette mexican , . grannie goulashcook 1 1/2 cups long grain rice ( i used texmati you end up 3 cups rice)note : i am vegetarian so i not use bacon grease anymore but it really good bacon grease instead vegetable oil . large skillet brown 1 pound ground meat some 4 tablspoons olive oil or corn oil when it starts getting almost browned , add 1 large chopped onion , 2 or 3 cloves garlic chopped , 1 large or two smal bell peppers 1/2 inch cubes ( add some chopped big hunks two ribs celery)(can use red bell peppers also ) . cook until onions sweated garlic well . low heat - add 4 tablespoons gebhardt chili powder ( least i use more ) if you some ground cumin put spoon too . stir it around so chili powder good absorption oil , salt pepper taste . you add packet sauzon achiote cilantro or packet azrafan but it not really necessary because disk takes its main flavor gebhardt'sif you get hold rotel tomatoes ( drain most water off ) , or you add 1.5 cups tomato sauce , or chopped tomatoes , or even thick tomato juice , salsa works good too . add 1.5 cups whole kernel corn ( i use frozen ) you put mexicorn it looks good too . 1 cup kidney or pinto beans or you made . stir this around simmer low heat until heated through . when it all heated put 1.5 cups 2 cups rice heat toss well but lightly so not mush rice . i serve this grated cheese top but you put cilantro , chopped tomato , sliced olives , avacado even plop sour cream . one dish meal easy clean up leftovers great next day omlette or tortilla . this recipe very fogiving so you pretty much use what you hand . grannie effie 6 children fed most neighborhood during drepression	1

my first culinary memory involves surreptitious finger dip into marmite jar age three ; it first food i remember really loving . ever since then i difficulty getting enough it . not everyone reacts it same way . some imagine it looks too much like axle grease . others complain it smells too much like beer left overnight go bad . these facts suggest one might only serve it close friends only when there some alternatives . any case , marmite claim " love it or hate it " quite apropos . it rarely evokes neutral reaction . best preparation i think mix it thoroughly butter . one part marmite two or three parts butter . then spread thinly toast . served this way , primary flavor marmite salt . then there subtle meaty flavor sometimes called umami - it flavor present well browned mushrooms or red meat . label suggests it might put excellent use soup stocks substitute or supplement caramelized roasted vegetables - onions carrots . nutritional value , even spread thinly it dynamite . those who fall hopelessly its charms may find themselves consuming mega-doses few crucial vitamins . it exceptionally rich source b12 , folicin , b6 . since it free animal products it ideal food include vegan diet which normally falls short delivering b12 .	1

easy sprouter great vertical sprouter . seeds or beans go into inner cup drainage holes . inner cup sets outer cup which catches any dripping water still allows air circulation around inner cup all sides . maintaining your growing sprouts ( most seed types ) means holding inner cup under running water least thirty seconds , allowing excess water drain off , setting inner cup back outer cup . doing this two or three times day makes sure growing sprouts remain fresh enough avoid spoiling , moist enough not dry out , but never remaining standing water . most seeds need pre-soaked initially , this step managed directly easy sprouter . there three lids : two lock into place - one air holes , one without . third domed , but doesn't actually lock onto cup . comparison , sprouting canning jars requires jar filled emptied several times each rinsing , draining sufficiently not always easy . sprout master , which sprouting tray i love , allows similar rinsing , but seeds must soaked different container then transfered sprout master . sprout master allows growing plants slightly more light because it width rather than height , but difference slight . i've mostly used my easy sprouter leafy sprout salad mixes ( alfalfa , clover , etc ... ) these varieties take week grow . variety lids sprouter it very flexible . i haven't tried sprout while traveling , but i'm confident it would work well . it works storing your grown sprouts fridge advertised , but i usually take them out sprouter break up clumps before serving put any left-overs into different container . i use my easy sprouter nearly constantly , my sprout master mini trays . i currently second easy sprouter order	1

**** tazo passion herbal infusion somewhat tart , deep , flavorful ( hibiscus-y tasting ) tea . it not berry-like taste , although it red color . it difficult describe what hibiscus tastes like , but i find it most pleasant taste . my husband says it tastes like pomegranate him . although passion contains licorice root it not sweet . ingredients passion : hibiscus flowers , natural tropical flavors , citric acid , orange peel , licorice root , cinnamon bark , rose hips , lemongrass red poppy . it caffeine-free ! tazo interesting company makes only super premium teas . they socially responsible , based portland , motto , " reincarnation tea " . tazo owned starbucks . their web site fun quirky , zen-type focus , definitely worth checking out . it unclear , though , their web site , how many their ingredients organic or kosher , they use some " natural flavors " their teas -- this wording seems little vague super premium tea . paper tea packet , tazo writes , " tantalizing deep red tea made hibiscus flowers , exotic herbs natural tropical flavors . " their web site , tazo describes flavor profile passion " berry , juicy , wine-like , merlot , sweet , earthy , dense " . tazo describes aroma " sweet , juicy , red fruits " . i would rate this tea , tazo general , very good --- better than premium teas like stash or celestial seasonings --- but not good numi . i'm soooooo spoiled numi teas , which why tazo passion gets only four stars . ***	-1
