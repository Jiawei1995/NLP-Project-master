i 3 1/2 year old boxer barks , cries , whines , howls when i go work ... all day ... i know , i recorded it . i went petsmart picked up this gadget . brought it home it manual correct button . she bolted . she hates ultrasonic noise it makes . it reduced amount noise my dog makes but only certain area i don't crate my dog when i'm going away more than 8 hours . so if i'm just running out few hours i stick her her crate this right front her but if i'm going work i use it conjunction petsafe electric shock bark collar . my girlfriends dog not really notice it if he otherwise engaged but my dog hates it . worth price my opinion . best advice take it home try it . some dogs react it . others don't	1

i black fusion my home office ( which next basement-level theater room ) , my wife i already love this machine . we tried all sorts mixes , we've only scratched surface what this machine . this one first times i've so impressed product i wanted write review it . physical properties : it handles travel mugs ( if you remove drip tray , which largely unneeded anyway ) , all our " standard " mugs . drink head moves up down , so it sit flush against rim your mug cut down already rare splashbacks ( more common " frothy " drinks than coffee tea ) . when it brews filterpack , it blows air through end cycle clear it out ( , thus , keep it dripping you remove it ) . water tank could larger ( if only because we're so enamored it we keep making drinks all day long ) , but if you ready source water nearby , it shouldn't problem . tank fits better slides easier than senseo ( which we also ) . flavor-wise : it made mm/mars , so you bet sweeter drinks ( so-called indulgence fare ) excellent . coffee blends quite good , especially darker roasts like " french roast " " sumatra " . lattes made espresso roast taste similar starbucks , moreso than other chains . clean-up : wipe inside drink head , possibly front plastic column ( colored portion ) after any particularly " splashy " drinks . no need worry cleaning up area around machine , especially if you keep drink head rim your mug . course , you can't watch its magic when drink head low , so your first few times , you'll probably get drip here there . final bits : we've senseo since its launch . pods need " pre-wetting " avoid blowing past seal portafilter not-so-great varieties drinks , senseo lagging behind flavia . we drink coffee , tea , espresso drinks , mixed blends , swee t-t ooth-friendly " indulgence " mixes every day flavia , it brain-dead-easy use . certainly easier clean up after , too ! if you're fence flavia other single-cup offerings ( like senseo ) , get flavia . keurig other single-cup offerings can't touch variety drinks you make flavia . i'm sipping lemon/blueberry tea blend now , made over ice , it fantastic . highly recommended	1
like many people , i ignorant neighbors allow their yappy mutt bark . despite talking neighbor politely such , they still no concern noise pollution . i losing sleep , barking getting so bad i even considered moving ! desperation , we looked online something stop barking dogs . we came across viatek super bark stop decided risk money . wow , talk worth money ! my husband affixed device piece wood , staked it 5 feet high our back yard . it unsightly , yes , but we're only ones really see it . more importantly , it right line barking mutt . first time he tested it , he told me dog jumped out its skin ! we laughed gleefully . could good night sleep actually horizon ...? it several days super bark stop worked amazingly . dog lie far it away device ... when it usually lay middle neighbor yard . if it starts yelp little , it stops almost immediately . it if it afraid bark . yay ! you select volume , tone , number barks help eliminate false activation ( say , talking or loud bird squawking ) . audible inaudible both work fine , but we now keep it inaudible two bark setting . device waterproof plastic you need 4 batteries ( not included ) operate it . i am so thankful we found super bark stop ! my nerves really getting jangled i dreading early mornings , when they put mutt outside . it amazing how inconsiderate neighbors ; just because you may want dog doesn't mean i want saddled its noise while you neglect it ! p.s. after using bark stop 2 weeks ( yes , it work ! ) , we noticed neighbors dog started bark bit more . ( not bad before , though . ) we it silent , realized it stopped working . apparently , it not 100% waterproof , despite claims manufacturer . person i bought it said " once it opened , we find it not 100% waterproof " . well guess what ? you gotta open it put batteries it ! either buy faux bird house protect bark stop or house it where it won't get wet . otherwise , you may find yourself same position we . we got refund , fortunately us , our neighbors got rid their dog ... so we didn't bother getting new one	1

my wife bought this one best buy without me reviewing it 1st . amazingly , i would bought it after reading reviews here . i'm starting wonder who writes these things ... lg employees ? microwave fine - no complaints . toaster , however , unmitigated disaster . i am opinion you should rarely combine appliances - this appliance poster child this thought . toaster browns extremely unevenly inconsistently ( sometimes you should toast same piece bread 5 sometimes high 10 ! ) . more importantly , toaster broke after 31 days ( coincidently best buy return policy ends same time - best buy unacceptable return policy but guy named " ricky " managing store what you expect ? ) . lg picks up phone quickly they honor warranty . problem they can't think outside box . they me get it repaired but i inconveniently drive it out there pick it up - ok ... no problem . one day later ? it breaks again . it extremely poorly built appliance repair people thought they fixed it not . that how bad it . lg not budge - it repaired again ( great option - costs lg money , me more travel time , it won't job ) or rebate . rebate requires me buy lg or goldstar product . huh ? so you create shoddy product rush it marketplace ( they admitted they don't detailed enough repair history because it too new ) then don't stand behind your product . you backend me into lg or goldstar product i would not otherwise bought . how our government allow these atrocious foreign companies business here ? our we so bad manufacturer we can't top this ? their supervisors very hardlined there no getting around this . " you cal korea but they won't change their policy " they said . i never willingly buy lg or goldstar product i highly recommend you same . shame you lg - you could me appliance buyer next 50 years now your name mud me	-1

i bought this make meaty stews rice my dogs . it works while then stops working , or just goes warm . they replaced it three times -- everytime it went out . this seems common cheap rice cookers -- see reviews rival rcs 200 , they all go out within days or weeks ! i guess black decker rival used same chinaman design these useless things . i can't understand why amazon et al still selling these when obviously they not work . companies replace them but all replacements go out immediately . frustration i bought aroma 60-cupper $125 -- after two months also went out . any suggestions 20-cup rice cooker longevity would appreciated	-1

first off , this machine looks great . but unfortunately , that where attraction ends . you see , i too used little krups $45 espresso machine years . but it heck lot easier use , made consistently better espresso/cappucinno than this dog . here brief synopsis . reservoir holds enough water just couple days . i'm constantly refilling it . after making espresso , thing leaks out coffee drippings minutes end , making mess whole machine . steamer seems spurt out much water it steam . lever dispenses steam not move fluid fashion . positioning coffee holder pod thingy downright cumbersome . i mention thing leaks ? now you might forgive little bugger if it made amazing capuccino ............... it doesn't	-1

well after reading reviews this vacuum , i decided give it try . i it month now i say i am sorry i bought this behemoth . right out box trying it first time i noticed things i didn't like . i thought i ' give it some time though hoped i could adjust . here what i found : 1 . vacuum very heavy other reviewers stated . 2 . worse than vacuum heavy , darn thing really hard push . even hard smooth surfaces it hard push . i not figured out yet what heck would cause it so much drag . it drag hard surfaces , it must design flaw . 3 . on/off power switch foot operated . not terrible thing but dirt devil decided put darn thing out view hidden accessory carriage . my first time vacuuming i accidentally ran over sock it got caught floor brush . while brush belt smoking i fumbled around damn power switch . i finally reach down press switch hand because i couldn't find it looking down . it must taking me eight ten seconds finally turn thing off . unfortunately , damage . belt snapped . how nice . i really liked . first time out belt snapped . note switch ; there times i repeatedly press switch because it would not lock off . it takes firm steady pressure turn it off . fun part this annoyance you think you it turned off because motor starts winding down soon you let up it motor powers up . couple not able really see darn thing it real challenge . maybe dirt devil thinks we eyes our toes . hey dirt devil here idea . how putting on/off switch push handle . what novel idea . doh ! 4 . vacuum hose detaches really unwieldy . it long plastic handle you hold onto makes it really difficult manipulate hose . main reason hose it too short . it like you fighting hose all time . it gets tiring . 5 . detachable hose really hard re-install it port . you wedge it there really hard get thing seat . 6 . vacuum terrible rugs , any floor height settings . it bunches up rugs starts smoking baby . my old vac not much better but least old one i could lift vac kind drag it over rug it wouldn't get all caught up . i tried same thing dirt devil forget it . it jammed up every time . 7 . vacuum poor getting dirt off hard surface floors . it just moves dirt around or spits it out back . i use hose attachment . 8 . vacuum horrible steps . my old vac i could drag vac across each step whilst vacuum locked upright position . easy deal . dirt devil not work way . when vacuum upright position brush too high off carpet any good . only option disengage lock vacuum back slanted . one little problem . weight vac cause seal base dirt canister open air begins leaking . you don't get good positive suction . so , you play position tilt get proper seal . problem proper position you need so close where vacuum locks into upright position . it often locks so then you try un-lock it while balancing this heavy behemoth . it joke . only half easy way steps if use detachable hose attach power brush . only problem you fighting ill designed hose heavy vacuum , not mention brush attachment only really get surface dirt . if you try putting pressure some deep cleaning brush stops . now pros : 1 . vacuum seem get carpets pretty clean . it good suction it raises carpet fibers right up . it almost makes my carpet look like new , i not see excessive amount carpet fibers dirt canister . some vacuums like just tear up carpets . 2 . rotating brush attachment works pretty good removing cat hair off couches bedding . all all this vacuum very very poorly designed . i may just donate this thing buy something else . i can't imagine fighting this thing every week years come or until motor dies . maybe i'll lucky motor die soon . then i'll just throw darn thing out buy something other than dirt devil . steve	-1

apparently 3rd hierarchy 4 models new s5 series miele vacuum cleaners , features , price , accessories not exactly linear transition lower higher models , nor even across series . many older series models more features higher price than newer ones . they fancy names like capricorn , red velvet , champagne , leading much confusion forcing you compare each one similar buying car . if your browser tabbed browsing ( e.g. , firefox ) , best way figure out which model best you go miele website open tab each model you're interested . flip back forth see what text changes . callisto cheapest no frills model newest series ( newest technology motor ? ) still comes electronically powered brush ( 4th pisces model turbo ) . after 3 months extensive use : pros : agility - 10 � " wide seb217-3 electric powerbrush comes standard , one reasons i chose this model . me , smaller better . while other vacuums advertise large 13 " power brushes cover more area single swipe , i don't much open carpet space . coffee tables , chairs , weight benches , computers , all need vacuuming around under . powerbrush swivels well get around corners . brush duster - most commonly used attachment ( me ) , brush duster also small ( slightly larger diameter than hose ) bristles durable . it angled default , but even this plastic piece swivels straighten out . this not mentioned anywhere ; you just figure this out yourself . low power , i able vacuum places never got vacuumed before , like over spider web computer cables telephone wires . i even vacuumed telephone itself other dust collecting objects my desk . parquet floor brush - initially , i wondered why miele would include this accessory when powerbrush included , but this " wider brush duster " actually better job hard tiled floors than powerbrush . powerbrush seems more designed churn up stuff carpets , but paraquet brush gathers collects dust stuck hard surfaces better . negative side , you might vacuum brush itself unstuck dust , i wondered why they inconvenience horse " genuine horse bristles " . there no permanent storage vacuum cleaner parquet brush , so you figure out how ensure parts don't get separated life ( powerbrush takes precedence ) . cord rewind - mechanical rewind sucked entire length cord every single time , something like 15 15 times ! ( manual says pull out entire length cord before use help dissipate heat . ) cons : price - after all , it just vacuum cleaner . there also seems price fixing newer s5 series , least when i bought this . everywhere i checked ( maybe 10 websites ) , price exactly $799 or $799.95 , only difference no tax and/or free shipping . one website even advertised " lowest price allowed ! " what diamond dealer ? this amway ? release buttons - release buttons attachments hose counterintuitive , part " comes off " rather than part " stays behind " . therefore , you must squeeze button same hand you pulling away . hose extension button particularly confusing . it oval shaped rocker button " rocks " very little . extend stainless steel hose , you remember which side button ( top or bottom ) press . there no distinction which side press , it always matter trial error i yank tug hose while pressing top bottom extension button . stiff no swivel hose - hose rotates top ( handle area ) , but not swivel base where it connects machine . instead disconnecting reconnecting get rid twists , i'd rather pick up powerhead spin it around get out twists . flex hose diameter larger than i'm used , making hose stiffer difficult store same closet where i used store my old vacuum cleaner . considering price , electrical slip ring would nice . bag full indicator - mechanical bag full indicator actually indicator how much vacuum cleaner straining suck . put your hand over end block suction it indicate bag full . right out box short carpet , it indicated bag full high power . i turned power down , it indicated less full sequentially . you read instructions using floor tool tool slightly off floor get accurate reading indicator . even , there caveats fine dust or pet hair fool indicator . extra stuff ? - parquet brush comes attached short plastic extension difficult plug directly into stainless steel hose ( button doesn't easily click into place ) . extension isn't needed connect parquet brush , so you remove it keep track where you put it . this day , i still haven't figured out what extension , other than connect other attachments i might buy future . this yet piece no place store vacuum cleaner i must ensure not get separated life ( parquet brush , " normal " filter cage , replacement bags ) . symbol marking - power symbol markings not obvious all , contrary claims . other than symbols labels " min " " max " , you read instructions figure out what other power symbols mean . least power seems increase sequentially you turn dial clockwise . quite mode #4 6 settings ( 6 highest ) , therefore not actually quietest but intended " normal " operating mode . i think most people consider " max " default mode . optional filter frame - this model comes hepa filter , so you don't need filter frame unless you're going switch " normal " filters , but brand-new right out box frame normal filters came broken cheap plastic handle , apparently due way it shipped handle protruding out cardboard wrapping . you don't even need handle frame function properly , but kind money i paid , nothing should broken out box . vendor i bought it ( best vacuum ) replaced it free . so it worth $800 ? it good job , but only time tell ..	1
what people don't think how hot chocolate works just well coffee coffee mug . i'm not coffee drinker but if this mug brings you great coffee joy you should also pour hot chocolate it . i take point off because after you pour coffee this mug enough times permanent smell left there , which means using this cup anything other than coffee or hot chocolate gross . especially water . who wants take sip water only smell coffee every time you put mug your face ? not me . not smell coffee horrible or anything . it smells good i can't imagine not smelling it every morning when other people my home making some . great mug you should buy .	1

i bought bark stop 2 weeks ago . i read several reviews either really good or really bad so i quite skeptical , but my dog ( jack russell terrier ) would bark rays sunlight coming into house , so i desperate . most important thing remember when buying product like this there aren't many things both great easy . when you buy treats dog train him , you simply leave treats out all time . no . because he would never figure out treats reward doing what you wanted him . it same thing bark stop . first thing you should this device put it audible setting then test see what makes bark stop actually go off . i found doors shutting hard , clanging dishes , etc all set it off . so , if device goes off every 5 seconds , dog isn't going think second it going off because he barking . he going assume it uncontrollable sound he live . so after putting device back into ultrasonic sound setting , i decided i would only plug device when dog barking or when he his cage . also , i never leave device plugged when i'm doing dishes slamming doors , or doing loud things . so dog only hears device when he barks . i realize this might slight annoyance walk egg shells order make sure device works , but i would rather than barking dog . way i look it , i wouldn't just randoming throw my dog treats middle his training , so why leave it plugged all time . end , first time i plugged bark stop , i let dog bark it out . he barked 5 minutes ( normally 10-15 ) then stopped . second time i plugged it , he didn't bark more than twice . bark stop puts out ultrasonic beep when you plug it , so i think now he knows when he going hear more than he wants . i think dog now gotten more used it , try out bark it , but most part , he doesn't bark much all while it , if he barks all . one thing manual say if dog trying protect house , usually this device won't help , which i think good thing . cons : when i testing microphone ( used taking bark loudness ) device , it didn't seem matter if microphone high or low . also , this device would so much more useful if it came remote turn or off , not manage each bark , but simply able sit couch click it , or click it off	1

i originally bought this knife because one chefs restaurant i work one . i picked it up one day lightness balance blew my mind . couple weeks later i bought my own well ceramic water sharpener . i no idea what other guy must doing his knife but my blade sharpens very easily stays sharp months long you don't abuse it . far my favorite knife i used . one warning though : if you going large amount chopping ( like say you're prep cook or you make thanksgiving-like dinners twice month ) then angled shape back blade may rub side your knife-hand index finger wrong way . i cook fairly elaborate meals almost everyday only irritated shape few times under heavy chopping regimes but it something consider . overall i couldn't love this knife more . it most important kitchen tool i ever owned	1

this bookcase fast easy set up , it fits perfectly small space i it . one thing i would change would put more slats across back it prevent small items falling off back edges shelves . but that not problem if you actually put books this bookcase .	1

i entire set swiss diamond addition this pan . i bought swiss diamond because , due weak wrists , i needed sturdy cookware not heavy stainless steel . because aluminum primary , affordable , lighter-weight alternative , one not want food coming contact aluminum because possible leaching it into food , i sought non-stick pans coating would not flake or scratch off end up my food . after much research , i discovered swiss diamond . i not disappointed . pans great weight -- hefty without too heavy , after several months use , coating holding up beautifully . i confess i not primarily use metal utensils it , however , so i can't testify how they hold up against metal . these pans caramelize food beautifully , evenness heat distribution them pure joy . they take few extra seconds heat up , but hold heat very well . i really love how flat pan bottom , imagine if you flush electric cooktop , these would especially appreciated . though i gas range , i trouble past pots pans slipping sliding enameled grates , but these pans not slide . i delighted discover , after realizing i accidentally left this pan low heat hour no food it , it not warp all still perfect condition . this cookware cleans up easily perfectly , too . i love they coated outside walls pans so any dried or cooked food comes off outside easily inside . one thing note if you looking pan cook eggs without oil , this may not your best choice . texture diamond coating seems grab more than slick teflon pan would , first time i tried flip my fried eggs without spatula , i less than stellar results . but sufficient oil , i flip eggs without spatula or problem ( i need make my daily quota coconut oil anyway health reasons , so i'm fine putting oil pan ) . if you use spatula , you should easily able flip eggs without oil . i hope these pans turn out durable over years . so far , after few months , they aces ! fact , my husband may growing weary my exclaiming , " i love this cookware ! " over over again .	1

there aren't any wine glasses out there i prefer over riedel vinum series ( except sommelier course ) . i one observation though , this why i didn't give this glass 5 star rating : vinums i've purchased past 5 months don't seem up same quality standards vinums i purchased year ago . quot ; olderquot ; vinum , which logo etched base , better/cleaner cut rim bowl seems thinner - making entire glass look , feel sound more elegant . quot ; newquot ; vinum , which logo quot ; riedelquot ; name etched base , lip which looks slightly rounded side-by-side comparison quot ; olderquot ; glass bowl/glass itself seems thicker . maybe riedel made some changes improve durability , but i like my old riedels better . all all , i said beginning this review , there nothing better out there than riedel vinum series ( long you don't pay full retail ) ...	1

positives it sturdy , heavy , good-looking , loud easy read timer . however , while it easy enough set , it takes sooo long set it compared cheaper , lower quality timers . you turn dial or press either button , wait numbers show , wait hours blink , turn wheel desired hours , wait minutes blink then turn wheel desired minutes . doesn't sound so bad but it takes couple seconds each step before numbers start blinking . others reviewers stated , kitchen aid better	-1

i received 6-piece cookware christmas i say this one best gifts i've ever received ! after first weekend , i already used all pieces least once , even twice . 6pc set includes dutch oven lid ( one i use most ) , 10-inch skillet , 8-inch nonstick omelet pan which serves lid 2-qt saucepan 8x12in square roasting/baking pan . plus , there bonus 4 1/2 qt soup pot - fabulous deal ! i've noticed such difference when cooking compared my all-clad ltd set . like other reviewer , i prefer le creuset . cooking le creuset really brings out flavors food cleaning sooooo much easier than say all-clad ! i'm not chef any means , but food i've cooked turned out superb ! i've made coq au vin , chicken marsala , loster bisque , chicken mango curry , tarte tatin , mango cobbler list goes ! big difference le creuset other cookware heat distribution . most cookware , it easy burn food once pan heated . but le creuset , it really hard burn your food or mess it up any way . way it retains heat amazing . this set not only functional but beautiful well . you transport this baby stovetop tabletop lovely dinner presentation ! le creuset may expensive side , but believe me you won't buying any other cookware after using this it worth every dollar ! it also heavier than average cookware , but you get used weight after while . all all , i absolutely love my le creuset set i'm more than happy everything it	1

i remodeled my kitchen purchased ceramic stove top no longer able use my cast iron gridle make my tortillas , so i looking something i could continue making them . i finally came across this grill which stated you could make tortillas . wrong !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! it not work , it not get hot enough . if you want eat raw tortilla , then it works fine . i called bethany housewares cresco , iowa spoke lynn sorenson , who identified herself owner . she very rude person care customer satisfaction . she stated since i used grill i could not get refund . i stated her i could not tell if it worked looking it . she then went state " if you buy clothes store wear them you can't return them . " statement not make any sense . i am going attempt get this matter resolved through amazon . if they can't help i out one hundred dollars . their product overpriced but i thought if it worked , it would worth money . what wrong this world . most people just care all mightly dollar . i make sure when i order kitchenware or appliance again it not kitchen kraft doing business bethany housewares again !!!!!! boiling arizona !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	-1
i decided " upgrade " spend more toaster , too . first one not work properly - one wires holds toast didn't move lever toast tilted one side burned . my second one - wires work but it not toast evenly all ! half time portions burned , even lower setting 3-4 . i don't see it whole lot faster , either . i've gone through half/loaf bread testing it i am not happy . i appreciate reviews amazon checked here see comments this product . it looks like two good reviews year ago , so perhaps manufacturing gotten sloppy . but my old , cheap , unattractive toaster better job than this ! i exchange it again or forget it ?	-1

i agree previous reviewer : this sharpest , most well made chinese chef knife out there . however , i guarantee you won't find this knife any authentic chinese kitchen because this knife just too expensive . if you want get good chinese chef knife , you should buy high-carbon stainless dexter-russell cleaver ( costs around $40 ) . it only slighly less sharp but difference not noticeable , especially if you chopping rather than slicing . there nothing wrong shun knife ; it just way too overpriced . it just knife , no mass-produced kitchen knife worth $170 , no matter how sharp it	1

i love my new griddle ! heats evenly . you even fry bacon it because well around edge deep . we only one problem -- handles . dials my stove back piece slightly extends over stove top . handles just high enough hit piece prevent griddle laying flat two burners . not problem ! my husband welds works metal so he gently removed handle one end . i believe he said he drilled out fasteners thereby preserving handle -- i could reattach it later if desired . if you don't equipment or knowledge this modification , i am sure you could take it welding shop they could easily same . it would well worth effort	1

after shopping carefully online off , i bought this item jc penney march 25 , 2006 . penney stated regular price $69.99 , sale price $49.99 , same price amazon currently charging . it replaces 10-year old black decker , primarily because i read several reviews suggesting dramatic drop quality bd small kitchen appliances hamilton beach performing well . i also several other hamilton beach small appliances all them function well what they designed . this seemed my best choice reasonably priced toaster oven , since i am not looking cheap convection oven , just acceptable toaster large enough baking potato now then or some other small item too large or wrong shape slot-style toaster . shopping i found no current toaster ovens lever press toasting - all now some variation twist dial this purpose . it ( so far ) performing acceptably oven , though top gets very hot . however , only first few uses produced acceptable toast even darkest toast setting . toast set dark got lighter lighter now , only three weeks after purchase , it no longer toasts all . it not darken beyond palest coloring toasting second time leaves bread only drier , not all darker . top elements not seem heat properly not reach red color needed toast bread ... or presumably broil anything , though i haven't ( won't ) use it broiler . hot top gets regular oven use , i am not confident it would safe broiler , even if upper heating elements working . three weeks post-purchase i no toasting capability all . i fully expect rest oven cease functioning soon , regardless , it no practical use me toaster , which small appliance i want need . i am returning it store starting search toaster oven over again scratch .	-1

this solid coffee machine . it makes great froth . unlike previous reviwer , i no problems froth attachment . trick make sure it assembled correctly froth correctly . make froth , keep turbo frother up close surface . you actually see frother suck milk hear hissing . heat up milk without making much froth , make sure frother below surface so you no longer making froth but heating milk instead . machine quality parts , big water tank , powerful pump , separate controls steaming making coffee , cup warmer ( which you probably don't need because there more efficient ways hear cups ) . it easy clean . i would only recommend getting decent coffee grinder , obviosuly one allows you adjust how fine you grind beans	1
these essentially bowls professional quality riedel vinum glasses produced without stems . doing without stems you get glass neatly fits dishwasher , save $10 per glass compared stemmed riedel . i using reidel o series several years they fabulous . since they genuine crystal opposed glass , they develop bouquet much better ( due microscopic " pores " regular glass lacks ) . they really gleam , right out dishwasher . best all , rims thin smooth , which luxury feel premium glassware all . if you wondering which buy " all purpose " red glass , i prefer syrah/shiraz glass over cabernet/merlot or pinot noir/nebbiolo , even though i drink mostly cabernet . syrah glass just bit taller more graceful than cabernet or pinot noir glasses brings out flavors aromas all red varietals quite well . but honestly , since all glasses well made , differences pretty minor if you like one shape more than , it fine . i wine " nut " over 20 years , these glasses teriffic . buy them , feel safe using them daily . they improve enjoyment every wine you drink , gallo lafite	1

i my rocky doserless grinder nearly nine months i never regretted purchase . this one premier prosumer grade coffee grinders delivers consistent quality espresso through drip ( almost ) up press pot . it solid , relatively quiet - i use mine my office small university close my door muffle noise little more - great option grinding each individual shot espresso . plus , its compact form factor mechanical-cool look mean rocky sit corner my desk , next gaggia factory lever machine it serves . highlights rocky its solidity quality , its ease adjustment , case this doserless model , its ability grind each dose espresso or brew minimal holdover grounds . because path burrs chute so short unobstructed , i rap side when i am dislodge any leftover grounds , or simply remove two screws holding chute use brush clear it . metal hoop below perfect holding gaggia or pavoni portafilter when grinding , removed one quick tug allow you grind into filter , press pot , or bag . rocky weight keeps it steady - it no flimsy lightweight - i personally like power switch grind switch separated doserless model . grind switch front convenien t.t he only things keeping rocky getting five stars grind settings . coarse end adjustment , rocky just doesn't quite make it real french press grind . this issue noted coffeegeek reviews which i didn't care when i bought machine , but which i now wish i considered . also , this niggling point , grind adjustments stepped , not stepless . perfect world , i like think all grinders should stepless like mazzer mini i occasionally get play . said , steps close enough i not found problem getting grind i desire , system release button collar adjusts burrs slick simple . if you market top end consumer coffee grinder , take good long look doserless rocky . when mazzer mini would overkill ( overpriced ) , but you want something closer commercial grade than solis maestro , rocky hits sweet spot	1

bonjour coffee press mentioned magazine ( maybe esquire ? ) top pick after little more research , we purchased 8-cup version . we ( our dinner guests ) loved it so much , we decided get 12-cup version . here why we like it : 1 ) container looks really nice table . we get lots compliments it . 2 ) we've it over 3 years now , use it daily , haven't single problem . i've read glass shattering or burning yourself w/other models , but we've fine . we often put it top rack our dishwasher normal dishwashing cycle , too . 3 ) it fairly easy clean , all parts unscrew if you want give it thorough washing . 4 ) probably all french presses , we feel like we get more flavor per scoop coffee . delicious coffee !! here some tips : 1 ) we grind our coffee store " french press " setting so it coarser . we measure coffee scoops , but not really water anymore since you get used just looking color mixture or how far you normally fill it . we use wooden spoon ( wooden chopsticks bbq skewers also work well ) stir grinds/water mixture - this helps prevent glass breaking if you accidentally hit glass . 2 ) i'd recommend getting this larger 12-cup version . mentioned product description it comes out 4-5 mugs coffee - this because " cups " they refer really teacup sized . this true all brands when they say " 12-cup , " not just bonjour . larger size gives you flexibility make little or lot depending your needs . 3 ) you also use this steeping tea . handy loose leaf teas aren't bags since you just press it down end	1

when i received this item i immediatley knew something would wrong . box it packaged delivered open torn up . not open like someone opened it i mean it sent box no bottom no side , just taped together styrofoam . i opened it thought well it maybe ok , this big item send . right front wheel off balance rest so whole machine wobbles , back panel puncture marks it off level rest machine . i thought jeez what i bought . so i thought well i hook it up use it , see how it . it ran beautifully cleaned my dishes cleaner than i ever seen them . point i thought well damage back wheel doesn not cause it wobble while it running so i just grateful i finally dishwasher . i unhooking it sink ball bearings hold connector piece place fell out down my sink . so i spent 2 days trying call company get replacement piece or something . nothing no answer all .... even during times they say they office there still no answer . so i searched online stores this piece . nowhere !!! danby not even registered sears or maytag ar any big dishwasher supplier matter . hell all actual plumbing repair stores not piece i needed . i told over over again , no one really uses hook up anymore ma'am , or " wow what ancient piece " . so i went online order $90.00 hose hook up ge . once it came i realized it not compatble this danby dishwasher . so i spent week trying call danby still no answer . finally my husband cut tubes dishwasher used hose clamps metal nipples piece dishwasher hoses new ge hookup together . i go out buy new adapter my sink danby one not work ge . but now dishwasher works it still cleans beautifully . ge hookup made little plastic nudules cannot fall out instead ball bearings which if you not careful fall down your sink . so i would liked give this product 1 or even 0 based customer service ( none ) way item packaged way it arrived so damaged , but dishwasher slean so very well . you dont even rinse plates before you put them they still come out sparkly . so all all i would never ever buy them again . if you add up cost dishwasher shipping , plus all money it took repair it , i could gotten much higher quality dishwasher no problems all less than what this dishwasher cost me end .	-1

i little sceptical buying non-stick , i am previous stainless steel user , but i really like hard anodized non-stick surface . it so much better than other non-stick cookware i've used/seen . it durable very easy clean . i cook electric stove , this set heats up so well evenly , i don't really miss gas stove , use lower temperature because way they transfer heat . i also love i need little no butter or oil cook , usually just use them flavor now . i wish lids saucepans fit omlette/frying pans . i've only set little over month , not used them oven , but so far i am very satisfied product	1

wish i heeded advice most reviewers before i purchased this . i went ahead purchased this because it replacing braun coffee maker we 10 - 15 years . after it got new plastic taste out it , it made good coffee . even without brita filter . just like all reviewers indicated , carafe leaked spilled badly unless you poured very slowly carefully . unfortunately , it quit working after only 2 1/2 months . seller , etronics , declining anything it saying it now outside their 30 return period . last thing i buy through them . like uhh , since they sell braun , one would think they would some recourse through braun try help their customers . so , here i am proverbial rock hard place , try find braun warranty center wait it get repaired or replaced , or just bite bullet go buy . ( want bet it won't braun ? ) additionally , what we coffee mean time ? such hazards purchasing electric appliance internet	-1

i bought this item based various reviews here other sites . usually , when majority reviews lean one way , i find they tend correct . this time ? wrong wrong wrong !!! this veggie cutter cheap piece cr*p ! it may ok if all you want cut soft veggies , but if you want cut potatoes french fries , dont bother unless you want blow $20 plus shipping . mine lasted less than 2 months before it fell apart . complete waste my money . i high hopes based upon reviews i read this product , but i lead down ( potato ) garden path . cutting potatoes ( main reason i bought this ) quite chore . i place it floor towel get really good leverage enable me cut my potatoes . main product plastic working parts less than sturdy steel rods . i am really disappointed this product . if you planning cutting potatoes or other hard veggies , then please not waste your money . many people rated this item very high their reviews . i really cant believe these people cut potatoes this . this product just not sturdy enough job !! i write this review hopes i save others throwing their money away searching good french fry cutter . if you choose ignore my warning it breaks you ( which it ... sooner or later ... probably sooner ) , yes , me you hear saying " i told you so " . caveat emptor !	-1

like previous reviewer , we've also gone through several rake-type automatic cat litter boxes ( all litter maid brand ; 2 lm700 , 1 lme9000 ) two which failed after one year , third simply worked so poorly we couldn't wait get rid it . we'd spent enough those three buy litter robot some change left over . spending so much automatic litter box may seem silly some folks , but my wife i travel lot work can't half-dozen litter boxes laying our two cats , nor we wish spend time cleaning all them after we get home . so anyway , machine ... litter robot big ! i'd read measurements , but when i pulled it out box i still surprised ! make sure you've got room it . my first impression it after size it heft . this thing sturdy , nothing cheap it . all interior parts heavy well assembled rivets or screws , well shell . next thing i noticed simplicity . no complicated moving parts like some boxes rakes , lids , etc ... ; motor turns ball , that all you see , drive gear hidden below ball . item assembled flash : put ball base , line up gear , plug power , turn . that it . i filled it standard scoopable/clumping kitty litter . only error i made i overfilled it little it dumped some litter floor when i test cycled it . no problem , clean up mess take few scoops litter out . overall impression device it good quality should provide good service years . my only faint potential misgivings motor , circuitry rubber liner . if any these fail , i hope company still around get replacement parts . i also note no large benefit litter catcher step other than catching some my overfill . when our cats finished box they launched out door land floor , they still scatter litter . oh well , nothing new there compared regular box . cats . we switched boxes them cold turkey . our cats aren't very skittish but they don't take quickly new large devices smell funny make odd noises . they spent lot time sniffing it checking it out , but they refused use it . they held out 24 hours they couldn't stand it any more ; we observed cat equivalent crossed legs jumping up down few hours before they hopped ( meowing , walking up box looking inside , walking away , pacing , repeat ... ) , but soon one hopped used it , other couldn't wait stood door jumped soon other left . problem solved , they now litter robot converts . overall , so far we very happy it . we got over " sticker shock " size , cats got used it less than day . litter robot works exactly it supposed , we hope years serivce it . much better quality device than any rake-type litter boxes we . it leaves no bits floating litter after cycle , needs no hand cleaning after few days like rake-type boxes . we'd recommend this box . now i just resist painting it look like eva vehicles " 2001 : space odyssey " ; " open pod bay doors , please , hal ... open pod bay doors , please , hal ...	1

i bought this popular online auction $25 , but i didn't know what i getting into . buy this only if you accept following : good : other writer reported , suction unit superior , esp compared uprights hose attachments . cord pullout retract again , superior . better than my electrolux ... bad : hose extension wands proprietory , , don't expect use your old crevise brush attachments all superior suction . you can't attach crevice tool end one wands . you need attach crevice tool order put brush . gimicky . furthermore , wands fly apart unless you jam them hard . unit lacks beater-bar . don't expect this any value carpeting . on/off switch small could positioned better . no turning this guy on/off your foo t.t he bagless design old-school . it uses same permanent coffee filter design that around years years , you see it clog up no time . superior suction compensate , but you'd think after dyson solved problem one way , others would soon follow . not case here . but real bug release dirt compartment part handle . real careful picking this guy up or dirt go flying all over ( down stairs ! ) . who would think someone would pick thing up handle ? however , i should say suction very good if you don't need carpet cleaning , never want use your own cleaning attachments use it under limited circumstances , it not bad deal price . i use it cleaning out computers . all all , however , except those limited circumstances , very soon after buying this you'd realize you should paid little more gotten something you use long term .	-1

i bought this ( black ) williams sonoma over $100 - thought i'd spend extra $ thinking i getting quality item would last . . . boy i wrong , wrong , wrong ! my cheap mr. coffee lasted longer than this thing ! day 1 - plastic smelled sooo bad it turned taste my coffee into cupful plastic , chemical waste - after cleaning/ running vinegar through last 4 - 5xthroughout - it nothing but leak , flooding my kitchen counter every time i wanted cup coffee - less then six months later leaking got so bad it ready garbage . one last attempt before deep sixin ' it - figured maybe seal water measure just need jiggle . . . w/ hardly any pressure - thing jiggled right off coffee maker into my hand b/c plastic so brittle . coffee also doesn't get all hot cools very quickly - even ' thermal carafe ' which perfect if you like lukewarm coffee turns ice cold after adding cream2 stars looks alonemay better off/cheaper buying couple disposable $40 coffee makers , replacing them every 6 mo	-1
i wanted love this toaster , i really , i read all reviews convinced this would great working , long lasting toaster . i bit bullet , spent way more money than i wanted , ordered this toaster . i like way it looks i like it doesn't ' pop-up ' , you check toast anytime you want return it toasting cool lever . however , i wish i returned it . it slow , it pain plug before each use ( must unplugged when not used ) , worse all : it not toast evenly ! top burnt , bottom not even toasted all , or one slice perfect other slice like it never put into toaster . this toaster would waste money $9.99 , it should illegal charge $200 . it . said , amazon price 200 . better deal than william sanoma 299 ., but i am still sooooo disappointed this purchase . upon re-reading other reviews i find people purchased ' refurbished ' models seem more pleased their purchase . leads me wonder if upon ' refurbishing ' they making them better somehow	-1
this pot easy use , convenient , compact , good looking great investment	1
braun aroma deluxe kf550 very good small appliance company generally associated better than average quality . not all braun products exemplary , but majority them easily better than competition price reflects higher level quality . this coffee maker braun looks nice stylish ; offers some extra bells whistles my most coffee maker don't ; carries braun name- brand name i grown know trust . i like added features braun aroma deluxe kf550 offers , like permanent filter , pause serve feature , brita water filter . each these items helps make process simpler smoother than before added feature brita filter not only helps brew better tasting coffee , it also helps keep coffee maker clean . purified water means less calcification means less cleaning vinegar or other decalcifying agents . i really like permanent coffee filter but there one drawback i noticed : tendency coffee granules get into pot brewed coffee . permanent filter nice but depending how finely ground coffee , it cause problems . example , if coffee ground very fine , like powder , it may end up seeping through permanent filter dripping into coffee pot , leaving murky mess bottom each cup coffee . other potential problem overflow . depending size grinds , they clog permanent filter cause basket overflow , transferring grounds coffee into your cup making small mess kitchen counter . one thing braun aroma deluxe kf550 doesn't offer ability program . this could deal breaker many consumers it little surprising braun doesn't include this its list features . it offers just everything else you could want coffee maker but there no ability program no clock . personally , i no use feature like this why i decided exclude it my list requirements when i went shopping coffee maker . its price , this coffee maker more expensive than most but i think price fair , even if it doesn't include programming . overall , i am happy my braun aroma deluxe kf550 . it brews tasty cup coffee without any fuss it offers ability stop brewing cycle order pour quick cup well security knowing coffee maker automatically shut off two hours . i few question marks this device- durability questions only answered due time . but i like what i seen thus far i recommend this appliance anyone who wants better cup coffee .	1

i reviewed most juicers ... many other major sites decided kitchenaid best product market . after receiving it , i changed my mind . although it promises easy cleanup " special tool " , it way too hard clean up . pulp basket contains ridge makes it next impossible get out all little strains pulp . special tool great getting out big stuff , but not little stuff . also , there ton juice left over pulp gets thrown away . this result poor design , which filters juice through pulp before exiting . product nice design looked good my counter-top , but it not deliver . i would recommend buying jack lalanne power juicer available other sites	-1
i've gone through three cutters borrowed one try out last few months . zyliss palm-held model ingeniously designed so-so use , but not really intuitive enough use readily or well ( i've professional hand tool user variety trades past 40 years ) . i tried out kitchenaid model smaller blade it nice heavy but unimpressive use . i suppose kitchenaid 4 " model might worked well , but it some negative features i discovered during my research . hanging hole set perpendicular blade - not good idea hanging against wall . handle metal plastic smooth ( not conducive maximum grip friction ) not shaped well good torque control . pistol grip nice , but doesn't really add control operator . lastly , axle bolt nut apparently isn't completely stainless eventually needs tightening because locknut nylon affected machine-washing temps . i'm not surprised mario batali stainless 4 " pizza cutter put out copco - i've coated , cast iron frying pan copco since early 1970 it exactly same condition when purchased - solid , beautiful , functional joy use own . this pizza cutter same attributes . it really well designed ergonomically , esthetically functionally . axle permanently riveted ( no bolt nut eventually go loose or rust after machine washing ) what appears single-piece axle/rivet , surrounded either side what appears neoprene washers . wheel riveted precisely enough there no slop whatsoever , yet wheel rotates perfectly during use no discernable friction . oval handle , covered typical soft grip we see nowadays contemporary tools , gives great amount control through grip friction torque . fit finish this tool beautiful , no discernable manufacturing flaws . use , it cuts like gangbusters - one quick slice through you're . no need back-and-forth get job ( i bake thick-style pizza ) . this thing really heavy substantial hand . much , * much * better than anything i've used before . obviously designed someone who knows what they're doing . price ($15 when i bought it ) ridiculously low , considering workmanship quality . i'd recommend this pizza cutter anyone serious their pizza . thank you , mario batali ( one my favorite food network chefs )	1

i really like look these square dishes . switching stoneware corelle good decision . they take up much less space my kitchen it easier carry whole stack them my arthritic hands . because their smaller size , we use lunch plates more often than dinner plates . but we miss smaller bread butter plates , so i ordered some plain white round 6 3/4 inch plates . disappointed we couldn't get small square plates , but round ones ok . 22 oz . bowls larger than most . slight lip rim helps remove them microwave without getting burned . corelle doesn't heat up like stoneware . also disappointed mugs not corelle glass , but porcelain . they feel nice your hand but could tip easier than most mugs . overall i really like these dishes would buy them again	1

my 30 year old ge blender/food processor combo broke blade blender part i could not get part so i toss blender container , leaving it stand-alone food processor . after debating buying countertop appliance , which probably would not durable something made 30 years ago , i decided give this blender try . i've always liked kitchenaid products , this one no acception . i surprised power this blender ! best part me it easy clean takes up so little kitchen real estate . making soups hummus breeze . whisking up egg whites so much less painful than dragging out mixmaster ... just give yourself big enough bowl or they all over kitchen . small food processing container just right size 1 or 2 people . variable speed lets me control how coarse my chopping too . i find turning entire apparatus upside down sideways or shaking it helped chopping everything uniformly ... but it only took couple seconds . i would given this blender solid 5 stars , but making smoothies ice not perfect , although once i got technique down ( moving blender up down around lot " attack " ice ) it ok . it took more than few seconds . if you drink lot ice blended drinks or smoothies , this job more efficiently good conventional blender . if you only use it occasionally this purpose , kitchenaid fine . maybe kitchenaid could come up special blade or container/blade combo ice blending , i'm sure lot people would buy it , i know i would . all all , i don't regret my purchase all . it versatile compact appliance me years come	1

i knew upfront other reviews when you first start delonghi radiator they bit oil smell . so when my radiators ( i bought two ) arrived , i put them open place , turned them max , let them burn off factory oil smell . smell gone two hours i brought them inside . they work great best all , they quiet , quiet , quiet ( only small click when thermostat turns off ) . i use them two rooms . one room 10x10 8 foot ceiling which i use home office . it heats room very quickly . other delonghi room 10x12 very tall gable ceiling ( 12 foot peak ) . initially i thought all heat would just accumulate peak , but it didn't . delonghi radiator fins moved enough warm keep whole place warm . these radiators small easy move around . i don't use thermostat because they heat sufficiently fast i don't need bother program mode . one thing i like these radiators they don't dry air way electric heaters ( i one it always smell burned dust air very dry afterwards ) . any radiator , please make sure you fresh ventilation room .	1
i just bought this model it far away best value i seen . i using juiceman 410 6 months , centrifugal model , i wanted try one masticating/auger types . z-star manual juicer single auger juicer without motor , cranking handle breeze . i performed test it my juiceman , where i juiced apple , lemon , kiwi , 4 strawberries , 1/8 honeydew , all unpeeled , each machine , z-star produced more juice . juiceman juice smoother whipped texture , but z-star made more all pulp bone dry . my opinion , there no reason buy motorized single auger juicer long they make this one .	1

i this thing probably 8 years or so . it worked great . tad noisy , but ground up seeds well , couple choices how fine grind you want . recently , it stopped working . it wines when you try get it actually grind , some seeds coming through . even when it work , it necessary shake it get it really get job . i guess age disposability , not so bad money	1
my sister previous model didn't work well . her all stainless salt not mill , it shaker . she hates it because salt saker filled bottom flimsy plastic cap that not good anymore . i like this one much more because it actual mill . careful which one these models you buy . there three kinds ; one adjusts grind twisting knob top , which isn't very good because it loosens shifts grinds ; other adjusts two settings only fine corse , which doesn't work well me either ; then there maybe five or six adjustable settings i think really best one bunch . i really like way salt comes out fine snow-like flakes rather then chunks i love results produced crushing peppers instead grinding them , process produces much more fragrant pepper smell taste dishes . product fairly new my kitchen so i can't tell you how it perform future . i am trusting it now	1

i disappointed this toothbrush holder after putting it use just one day - any drops water run down side holder or end up around bottom edge due splashing/runoff bathroom sink immediately seem trigger bottom holder rust ! i tried keep splashing minimum but this thing started leaving rust-ring my bathroom counter within couple days . i still use it since it nice-looking easily cleaned toothbrush holder but i keep coaster under it protect sink/counter . i wish i could give it more stars since i love look functionality it but i give it only 2 stars since i think making it rust-proof only common sense something sits next your sink . i wonder if all steeltek " stainless-steel " products rust so easily ??	-1

this wonderful utility wood cutting board . when shopping cutting board , there several factors you want consider : material , size , shape , upkeep . material : there several choose , but wood best if you care your knives your chopping arm . wood easiest your knives because blade sink into wood instead dulling it ( if you granite/glass ) . it absorbs shock impact , unlike granite/glass , which quite jarring cut . wood also natural antibacterial properties . there rumors going awhile dangers wood harboring bacteria , but after extensive research , they found out wood actually seems kill bacteria naturally . scientists not able recover bacteria wood board after hour , yet they could recover bacteria plastic after days ... there extensive material this , so i'll let you research more it your own i continue review this board . advantages plastic cutting board over wood board ( it easy clean , dishwasher safe , light , easy store ) goes downhill over time - whereas advantages wood board deteriorates very little over time . biggest reason this plastic cutting board only " cleaner " than wood board when it brand new . soon it gets knife scored , those little crevices harbors bacteria . people say taken care scrubbing soap - but think it , you can't fully clean your teeth just brushing ! why ? because brushing not get into crevices your teeth , that why it crucial floss . now think how much smaller knife cut plastic than crevices your teeth . microscopically smaller , yet large enough lots microscopic bacteria live . then some people say soak plastic board bleach water . this doesn't work either because vacuum effect water surface tension . you'd need able force bleach water into each knife score rinse out bacteria there . water not force it way into vacuum like it own ( what you're doing when you simply dunk it into container bleach water ) . bottom line when it comes plastic vs wood - wood natural anti-bacteria properties not diminish over time , knife scored plastic board not . even all studies people recommending plastic over wood tell you toss plastic board when it becomes badly scored . size shape : i think this 20 15 2.25 size excellent - although , it " heavy duty " size - it also comes thinner model , 1.5 " thick . i like board large enough chop , then move items over little piles off side while i chop something else . rectangle shape allows me this better than square or circle . oval shape might work , but it would harder store since you can't stand it it side . there larger smaller these john boos boards but i think larger one would too bulky heavy ( this board just topmost limit my kitchen countertop handle , my sink wash board ) . this board also 17.33 lbs , which makes it quite bulky heavy . these boards also comes 2 thicknesses : 1.5 " 2.25 " thick . i think if you buy wood board you want it least inch thick . thinner boards warp/break easier . you need it hefty . 1.5 " thick this board perfect regular home chef . 2.25 " thick one good heavy chopping - bones , more line " butcher block " . upkeep : glass/granite break/chip , but otherwise last forever . it easy clean , very pretty , dishwasher safe . it just jarring cut dull your blades . plastic superior everything easy . dishwasher safe . light , easy store , cheap , comes different colors ... but prepared replace it soon it badly knife scored . wood . all materials , wood needs most upkeep . you buy john boos mystery oil which mixture mineral oil , linseed oil tung oil . you can't just use any oil because it needs safe eat case any oil transfer , you don't want oil go rancid . you just oil wood every 4-6 weeks . wood not dishwasher safe . you want avoid ever soaking wood water , although quick scrub rinse through sink , quick thorough drying towel trick just fine . yes , it more work than others , but it not much work , i think it defnitely worth it . one more note wood boards . maple best material becaues it small pore size ratio hardness wood . you might think oak very hard wood , but it bigger pores , so stick maple . john boos cutting board conclusion : i think this perfect cutting board . material , size , shape , weight , all right . john boo also doing this since 1887 , so it good american company that around long enough know little something wood . customer service great well . my only complaint it not very pretty . it quite plain looking . wood boards gorgeous addition my kitchen , warming it up giving it very earthy real feel - but girl , cherry top would if it just " prettier " . one last thing , this board reversible . i don't like when they put little feet one side board prevents you using both sides . this extends use life board i think it shame take away . you always just place removeable , nonslip surface under your wood board keep it place - like silicone pad or sheet non-slip drawer liner stuff .	1
this product god send those people who dog pulls leash thereby making walking dog struggle ! dogs naturally tug against restraint . former methods using choke collar or even worse harsh coller cut into dogs neck if it pulls cruel my opinion method jerking dog back if it pulls . dogs not like thier heads turned if they pull . they immediately stop pulling ! i admit initially my dogs didn't like collar over nose , but passes quickly . this not muzzle any way . it gently humanely stops tugging you happy walks ! this product blessing ! you love it	1

i originally looking bosch turbo jet vac but found out bosch no longer making turbo jet under their name but they now making turbo jet vax . i purchased mine best buy . i really like looks features however this vacuum extremely horrible job carpets . brush roll assembly unit automatically adjusts height carpet however this one if major flaws i noticed hurts it . when you push forward vacuum , brush assembly tilts up toward air preventing brush rollers making contact carpet . there no way you manually adjust height rollers so it make contact carpet . you also cannot tell carpet vacuumed after numerous runs over same area due tilt angle rollers . emissions also bad . vacuum not emit " fresh " air smell but instead emits smell plastic carpet . filter horrilble job emitting clean air . last item i think hurts this model hose unit . it akward design hard use because hose length short hard pull which makes vacuum fall forward times . i returned vacuum different best buy than one i originally purchased . rep returns counter informed me they only carrying vax only few months but they extremely high return rate vax compared their other brands . i walked over vacuum section after i return replace it eureka 4870 which one consumer report top three vacs beats heck out dyson . there must least 7 used vax floor sold returns . eureka amazing blows away vax one hundred dollars less .	-1

now , they even them south ! gentle leader should not confused other head collars like halti . it far superior any dog breed or temperament . i've trained both my golden retrievers well dogs several relatives many friends over past six years using gentle leader . possible exception toy breeds , this god-send any dog owner rambunctious , head-strong or hard handle canine or if you just wants more control without extra work even trauma associated neck collars general . i my first gentle leader dog then my second , walking staying heel , sitting automatically upon stopping , turning both left right no longer lunging , pulling , jumping or straying ... all within less than 15 minutes each dog ! golden retrievers , course , wonderfully easy willing train anyway , but this so incredibly fast , it almost like watching some magic trick performed . it my vet fort lewis , wa who first taught me how fit collar use it . application simple once you see it first time . just place nose strap short flesh nose ( allowing dog breathe , eat , drink even carry items ) tightten head strap one finger tight behind ears ( base head , really ) . this gives you control ( nose strap ) dog sense well-being ( head strap ) . nothing all dogs neck or throat . i strongly encourage you someone experienced gentle leader use show you hot fit it properly first time . all dogs i've since trained or assisted their training there short-lived " leader dance " . this where , after placing leader first time , dog hops air then bows ground all while both front paws over it nose while trying remove collar . you continue give short firm tugs collar while continuing walk dog , dance quickly disappears within just few yards . i amazed how consistant this behaviour its let up always . leader basically uses same physical restraint mother dog or pack alpha male uses control puppy or young dog . grip over nose pressure back neck . it purely coincidental it looks like horse halter . control comes strap over nose . leash clips bottom this strap ( under lower jaw ) . short , quick ( but not violent ) tug leash leash brings entire head under control . head follows nose where head goes , body must follow . there never any need jerking , pulling or strangling dog . there never leash rope burns dog take control lunging away you . your arms stay their sockets , palm blisters thing past ( especially if you use cotton leash , or least leather one ... never use chain or poly-fiber leashes ) . some breeds huge necks high pain tolerance , such rottweilers , easily gently brought into line . my brother 2 years old completely out control . he heel , sitting turning within 5 minutes or so after i turned dog over my brother 15 minutes i took dog back let his 6 year old daughter lead him around . my cute tiny niece less control than dog , yet they both performed team ease . coolest thing head collar how dogs get really excited when they see it , knowing it going walk , training or just out public . they love gentle leader . gentle leader only used training or control . dog still wears its own neck collar , but only keep his tags , since dogs don't normally come pockets . gentle leader also huge facilitator " off-leash " training . dog so comfortable taking properly given commands leash , doing so " off-leash " seems take only one half one third normal time i once involved . , my friends , super endorsement , alone ! one last caution ... i pray you no way person who " stakes " out dog any reason . regardless , gentle leader should never ever used keep dog attached stake or wire run . running out end line coming up short neck/shoulders one thing neck collar . staking dog knowing head collar actually jerk twist head snap neck nothing less than cruelty , if not out out murder . use gentle leader only leash you one end dog other , please . i hope you found this useful , i know you find gentle leader . take care pass good time your canine friend	1

i assembled it all myself while my husband work boy i pleased myself ! chest took me 2 1/2 hours , which i think pretty good since i doing it alone , plus my 4 year old daughter kept distracting me few times ! only real problem came when i started assembling drawers , you could not put guides holes they drilled you because it wouldn't line up right , you move them all way side . bottom drawer sticks more than others . but i deal , maybe one these days i get around trying fix . i noticed drawers open better when you squat down level drawer pull it open . i no problems knobs falling off other people stated , though box end table knobs broken package . i called manufacturer they sending me two new knobs , don't know when they'll arrive though . there also one part assembling chest i skip because screws it called use too small too short where they supposed go .... they go under bottom decorative molding front screw through top chest , but screw way small , would not even go through wood . top screwed tightly down location so i skipped step you could not tell it functions just fine . very sturdy i highly recommend it if you wanting something not too expensive .	1

first - there no doubt this very expensive purchase , but if you two starbucks drinkers house it worth consideration . after i determined roi ( given our sbux frequency ) this machine 3 years , we purchased our first machine ( capresso 3000 ) 4 years ago . it love first drink . we went stopping coffee every morning way office , making it home some great to-go cups we purchased costco . when c3000 finally broke , we boxed up machine took it right back williams sonoma ( sorry amazon ) they happily took it back upgraded us z5 difference what we paid first unit price new z5 ( $350 ) . we love z5 !! my husband " straight " coffee guy , but i am late girl who loves how easy it hook up milk container make my late push button . i also purchased starbuck vanilla syrup so i make my own vanilla late home . if you disposable income consider this , it great machine . after reading customer service stories previous reviews , i would consider buying williams sonoma who offers lifetime guarantee anything purchased through them . when my $ 2,699 capresso failed after 4 years , they took it back without question upgraded me z5 . through entire process they just thanked me my business . i am customer life can't say enough how much we love this coffee machine !	1

riedel ' gold standard ' wine glasses but these glasses nearly ( no not quite ) but nearly measure up them much lower cost . i enjoy this glass because i use it both white red wines . i don't know others , but my cabinet space limited , i cannot number different wine glasses . there just isn't space . i strongly recommend cleaning these dishwasher . only breakage i occurred cleaning up after neighborhood get together one broke while friend hand drying it . fully appreciate these , remember fill them only ' break ' , point where glass starts turn back . if you fill them above this you not able properly swirl wine or enjoy its nose . buy these enjoy both them your wine	1
these finger bowls beautiful ! simple elegance , easy handle . they're bit wider shallower than i wanted , so i ordered steeltek stainless steel 12-piece condiment cups instead , which very inexpensive , slightly smaller diameter , but dramatically deeper ... perfectly sized scoop ice cream , dyeing easter eggs , kid finger paints , well ketchup , marmalades , melted butter , or more exotic sauces ... either hot or cold ( although course they can't go microwave ! ) . million 1 uses households kids ( 12 set ) . these sets 4 ( pinch bowls ) probably useful name implies , " pinch bowls " keeping small amounts seasonings handy when cooking , " pinch " out amount needed dish prepared , also probably good use finger bowls ... cleanse fingers lemon water courses , probably useful hold sauces , ketchup , etc ... but 12 set allows deeper " dip " into sauce . 12 set bowls much small deep effectively fit one fingers cleanse one fingers . they easily hand washable ( fine go dishwasher , too ) . if you want broader , shallower bowl , get 4 sets . if you want slightly smaller diameter , very steep sided deep bowl ( figure exactly size medium scoop ice cream ) , get 12 set . they're both made same company , sturdy midweight , not light flimsy . again , 12 set amazing buy	1

this pressure cooker bees knees ! i used fagor splendid duo while ( which two slightly smaller sized pots one set also share one pressure lid ) . i recently decided upgrade amazon this newer fagor duo combi 8qt/4qt terrific price two rebates ( one cookbook , other additional fagor " everyday pan " ) so i splurged ... also got free shipping . i'm still waiting rebate items arrive , but amazon i've never problem don't expect one . after this arrived , i promptly showed it off . my folks live next town they so impressed it mom one too . so dad got her this same set christmas replace ancient presto aluminum pressure cooker she used decades ( it its last legs , cooked hundreds upon hundreds great meals) ! old aluminum pressure cookers notorious problems . i've known people who scars pressure cooker accidents . admittedly , i bit leery first . but these newer next-generation pressure cookers very well constructed stainless steel using newer designs locking additionally incorporating several new different safety features design . my fagor splendid , soon i saw how well this new 8qt/4qt elite duo combi made , i felt very comfortable using it ! i must confess , i little skeptical first because fagor recently switched manufacturing spain " designing spain , manufacturing china " , but any concerns i quality quickly assuaged when i got set took it its first " test drive " stove , then cooked few meals . i'm happy report , no problems quality i tell . cooker : lid goes pretty easily . i'd give it 8.5 or 9 out possible 10 this area ... because there slight learning curve getting lid on/off , but nothing really worry . it well engineered lid fits both pots very well . both pots heat evenly come up temperature pressure very quickly . dual-pressure valve snap use ! just turn dial full pressure ( 15 psi ) or half pressure ( 8 psi ) . when it time release pressure , there third setting which opens valve let steam escape rapidly ... this great feature!i'd like add something which i found important . diameter . this set full 10 " diameter which makes browning either pot breeze . ( splendid set pots only 9 " diameter ) . so finding one 10 " near top my list ... this one didn't disappoint ! before upgrading pressure cookers , i researched several makes/models it looks like all them exception kuhn-rikon now made china . i like kr but it expensive largest pot 7 litres , whereas this model fagor 8 quart little roomier . using included glass lid , large pot doubles stock pot , pasta cooker , or steamer using included basket . you also pressure cook whole chicken ( or large roast ) still room vegetables . smaller sized pot doubles skillet ( also using included glass lid ) or it works great smaller pressure cooker smaller items or things you would cook flat such chicken breasts , etc . one final thing , handle design newer fagor pots great , helper handle front well loop design main handle allows you get your hand around handle grip it well when you need move it while it full ( or hot ) . overall , this great product i highly recommend it !	1

using frozen fruit make up 4 smoothies every day , our family hard blenders . after more than year daily experience waring pro ( both mbb * pbb * models ) i cannot recommend them serious smoothing making . here why : both glass- stainless-jug models use same blade assembly . this blade assembly wears poorly when asked blend frozen fruit . it fails often , must rebuilt or replaced . parts easily purchased if you're handy correct tools . details : assembly screws together , threaded tighten under use rather than loosen fall apart . but this tightening action so great when blade contacts frozen fruit , it bends metal washer below blade . assembly eventually becomes so tight shaft cannot turn . waring pro all blender than many people need , but not sufficient daily maker multiple smoothies	-1

when i adopted cat couple weeks ago , two my good friends highly recommended fresh step premium clay cat litter . here why -- this fresh step premium clay cat litter excellent your favorite kitty litter box . company states it very good absorbing odors -- , golly , it true ! odors minimal very most it quite comfortable even my rather sensitive cat . moreover , i really like how litter capacity absorb prevent odor causing bacteria litter before my cat even uses his litter box . that plus any cat lover ! if you more than one cat manufacturer recommend , not surprisingly , you use more cat litter box . otherwise , if you just one cat , two or three inches worth this cat litter spread evenly throughout empty litter box fine . you should change entire litter box once week average . ( i change mine twice week just my cat comfort . ) it also good idea scoop out any " kitty remains " every other day or so . very certain not flush any " kitty presents " down toilet manufacturer warns against this . i suppose it could clog toilet pipes . moreover , you may suspect , any " kitty leftovers " could some nasty germs we don't want so wash your hands really carefully after you clean box or even after you just remove any " kitty presents " scooper . fact this clay litter helps because you use very inexpensive litter scooper remove any " kitty presents , " thus reducing number times you need change entire kitty litter box . nevertheless , i recommend changing entire litter box least once week . place contents used litter box into trash bag discard you would any other garbage . short , this great cat litter product great price . contents bag last long time , especially if , like me , you only one cat . manufacturer also offers customers ( us , not cats ) " awards " program points you accumulate your " account " company company internet website . nice plus ! ok , fresh step -- i thank you ; my father mother thank you ; , most importantly , my cat says thank you !!! smiles	1

i baught my 8 " global chef knife 5 years ago . it great use kitchen remains one my favorite knives market . molybdenum/vanadium steel global knives holds edge far longer than its henkles/wustolf counterparts . my only complaint handle design which not suit my gripping style , nor my large hands . i don't mind steel handles , although they contribute slippage some loss grip . my main problem tapered bolster , which almost lack bolster altogether . coupled thin spine heal knife , extended use uncomfortable hand . i highly recommend globals , but i might suggest 8 1/4 " heavyweight model , which appears more standard handle design less tapering bolster . more info knife handling care you might check out cia book titled " professional chef knife kit " . one last comment . although all knife companies like claim their knives dishwasher safe , please , please , don't put your knives dishwasher .	1

this extra chime you purchase if you already receiver . i am purchasing one because it working so well . i am professional dog trainer , all i say product great , but owners who not know how teach something their dogs probably should call dog trainer help this if you unsure how proceed . professional dog trainer , i still live my family members who decidedly not dog trainers . our toy poodle essentially house-trained when i home , but because my teenagers husband oblivious her subtle signals she needed go out , she ended up peeing front door , because nobody letting her out . so , i got lentek door chime , taught my dog use it , now no more accidents because she signaling way everybody hear . we also put pad outside so she signal come back . everybody happy . now i'm getting pad upstairs , because we still oblivious teens hubby .... so , great product , but sure you * both * parts product , give good trainer call help you get started .	1

this my first time use electric krumkake baker i previously old type you use over stove . i feel baker doesn't bake evenly both sides ........ top krumkake cookie nice but bottom remains soggy side which leads me believe heat uneven . also there no indicator light let you know when cookie . therefore you really pay attention your time . usually it took only 55 seconds minute . also hard get two cookies commpletely round ..... batter ran into each other . perhaps my batter too runny but used this recipe before old iron without trouble . i'm point perhaps single baker would better than double . hope find person could demonstrate two cookie krumkake maker ...... perhaps would help . trying open-minded !	-1

we actually purchased 4 piece set ( unfortunately leaving review not option there . ) it indeed hardwood frame , beautiful suede-like microfiber cusions zip-off covers . color definitely more lines hot chocolate color rather than creamy chai color screen- but still blends beautifully into neutral palette . #60 ; br / #62 ; #60 ; br / #62 ; assembly bit challenging- you may need third or fourth hand . instructions certainly aren't complete enough- they more like general pictures , so there bit guesswork involved . upholstered side panels take bit quot ; elbow greasequot ; fit into frame properly . took us hour put together few o-o ver adjustments precision . #60 ; br / #62 ; #60 ; br / #62 ; i love back cushions velcro hold them place . cushions also surprizingly firm , but because seat longer than average legs , you tendancy lounge . i'm not sure what weight restrictions , but we 700 lbs couch it remained one piece ( can't say all couches we've ! ) overall very impressive package price ! we received free shipping used 10% off online coupon code so it great deal . i also highly suggest matching table set	1

these sheets indeed much more wrinkle resistant than my old 100% cotton 400-thread count ( very expensive ) sheets , but much thinner , surprisingly , suggesting more delicate threads . this fact borne out when less than month after starting use them , one my cats " kneaded " bed his claws , sheet irreparably shredded . this never happened before any sheets i owned 40 years multiple cat owning . sure , i've gotten thread pulls tiny little holes other sheets , but not knife-like cuts appeared these sheets , after just one kneading session . it really looked like someone taken pair scissors stabbed sheet repeatedly . despite high thread count , this cotton thin delicate . so beware if you pet-owner . you get what you pay these inexpensive sheets	-1
i bought two these lights delighted them ! they really range they claim . one , i placed my husband dresser bedroom ( am always tripping over his laundry basket when he forgets put it away ) . it immediately turns soon i enter doorway ( approx . 13 feet away ) . other livingroom windowsill , so when he gets up middle night snack , it immediately turns so he not tripping over anything or walking into corners furniture . it bright light ( but not overly so ) , stays long enough pass through room ... if i want it stay , i either flip switch it or keep moving into it sensor range . this great item dark areas your home . it works just like it says it . i highly recommend !	1

i used sell dishwashers sears . i've owned several built full sized dishwashers , even stainless steel bosch . this first one i am ' giddy ' over . i recently downsized move manhattan , which meant getting small kitchen no dishwasher . after months sink washing , i broke down bought this ( actually , house guest felt sorry me , got it me after i mentioned i buy it ) . but not without reading all specs reviews . i bought it etronics ( i've bought them before ) pleased customer service ( so far ) . they best price ( no delivery charge , they local store too ) . after unpacking inspection , i concluded it built same specs top line kenmore ( which i used sell ) . it form fitting stainless steel interior , mechanical controls ( which , imo , better than electronic machine gets wet alot ) , well fitting seals , stable casters . interior full size depth height , just 6 inches narrower width ( brand , which i viewed spot , not nearly deep , rickety trays ) . upper tray two height settings , but i found lower setting not suitable standard size dishes fit below . trays fit well , perhaps bit too snug , but we'll see if they loosen up use . tines spaced bit close together my taste , but after washing , it appears 1805 handle dishes so close together . there lower spray arm , middle spray arm top sprayer ( non-spinning ) . food filters heating element base sturdy well made . complaint : hose hook-up 6 feet long ( apparently measured inside back where they connect machine , they seemed too short 1805 must right up against sink counter hook-up . i've never portable before , ( exception my dear grandmother ) always looked down them . this one looks solid clean lines any kitchen . rear panel , however , you see few ( covered ) rivets seams , black-plastic lined hose receptable , serial tags . unless you store it against wall , you see these protrusions . it should fit all your other appliances without standing ou t.t he standard load time took 45 minutes run . machine attaches easily your faucet , though you replace your areator adapter produces narrower stream water faucet when dw not use . i've only used " economy " cycle , which worked great , but there also pots pans , delicate , rinse only cycles . additionally , delicate cycle no heat option , pots pans extra boost option . it heats water steaming hot . very quiet . though not quiet bosch i owned ( which i think quieter than meile ) , it quiet my kitchen aid . it definitely quieter than all plastic tub models out there . though hardly used , i experienced no leaks . this even operated non-level floor . my building 110 years old floors very slanted swelled . this my biggest concern . after each cycle , i took my flashlight looked underneath any signs water .... none . ( my neighbors below would not appreciate un-requested shower ) . i am penny-pincher , stressed over purchase . not because price , but because value price . i couldn't believe such inexpensive dishwasher could deliver like this one . i seriously say this dishwasher outperforms dishwashers twice its price . it carries in-home 1 year warranty , but i always like stores like sears where if you complain enough they take it back without any questions . so this bit leap , danby relies authorized service centers ( which i hope i never use )	1
i am very happy this product . it solid base i like it so easy adjust . i wish it dimming option .	1

i purchased both hencle pro sabatier grand chefs amazon . after two weeks using testing both sets knives , i decided return sabatiers keep pro . both sets good quality , even thought i notice scratches handles both sets . but i purchase knives use abuse , rather than hanging them decorations so minor scratches don't bother me too much . what matter me performance more importantly feel . i gotta say henckels just felt more solid me seemed sharper , cutting thru pretty much anything like butter . sabatiers other hand seemed little dull straight out box . factor i considered accessibility far warranties servicing concerned . i yet see any stores my area carry sabatiers lifetime warranty henckel i pretty much go my local retailer swap out any individual knives if needed . basically , i think it just comes down individual preference , mine happens henckle pro !!	1

baring calphalon name i expecting something really nice , especially price i paid through amazon $84.95 - boy i disappointed . although amazon selling it high-quality piece calphalon contemporary stainless 1-1/2-quart saucepan glass lid clearly cheaper side calphalon brand . it looks like one pans calphalon gives away get you purchase their higher end cookware . item arrived nicely boxed calphalon box but when i opened box pan looked like it originally return item before it sent me - pot lid both orginal packaging but lid clearly broken . it looked like someone taken hammer it stuck it back box sent it me . amazon agreed send replacement no charge but i can't believe they would sent something like this me begin without first inspecting what they send out . unless it given you " freebie " i suggest you save your money .	-1

this little toaster oven gets job me . i think quality little bit better , it little deeper making it little bigger tempeture more consistant than other units it price range . i am still looking right setting tempeture once i find it i most likely leave it there . i think it end up somewhere 350 400 . below takes long above setting food tends get little over cooked outside . one thing concerned me safety instructions , which i always read . they not want you use aluminum foil or any non proctor silex cooking trays this unit . i always use aluminum foil it not seem cause any problem . perhaps they just covering themselves case something goes wrong because you never know what sort crazy stuff people going put into their ovens . this only thing concerns me . otherwise little oven working out real good . i think it last us quite while . usually we get rid them because they get dirty or get little old looking more then it problem they wear out or break . last one cost us $10 lasted almost year . this one cost little more but i am sure it last longer . we expensive confection ovens cost well over $100 but i decided save my money because this one gets job what we need it . esp extra 2 inches depth this nice sized little unit .	1

this pretty much same review i wrote 8 " chef . i liked knife well enough i'm considering buying block set , though i don't know if handle design work well smaller knives . i'd give set five stars because it includes no knives too stupid or too specialized ( like boning knives bread knives slicers ) basic knife kit ( especially home cooks ) but inclusion laughably dubious kitchen scissors drags it down bit . 6 " chef probably marginally more useful than 6 " utility , but it nice least one knife you're willing hand your less skilled friends . set also includess diamond hone , which actually sharpen knives , not just align their edges ( though i use dmt diamond hone sharpening . ) here body other review . since i planning spend few days commercial kitchen , my 6 " henckels knives both embarrassingly small serious work embarrassingly dull because i'm too lame sharpen them , i decided grab 8 " chef knife ( bed , bath beyond , 20% off coupon . ) it worked extremely well all tasks i set it today , including mincing parsley chiffonading mint well usual cutting tasks . despite its shallow curve ( i strongly prefer knives whose edges mostly straight , rather than curved french style ) blade rocked very well mincing , flat enough cut completely through rolled mint leaves one short stroke . furthermore , sharpness impressed other people who used it , though we shall see if it resharpened same degree . handle design clearly not everyone , but i found it very comfortable when i held knife many cooks , back end blade pinched thumb forefinger(s ) . particular , most knife handles/bolsters seem designed people who grip knives solely their handles but integrated bolster made it feel * right * grip knife blade . handle * seems * just right weight balance blade , but i'll reserve judgment whether it actually well-balanced until i've spent more than few hours using it . i no idea if i'll continue like this knife it enters daily use . i hope amazon let me revise my rating later if it turns out overly optimistic , but based this one afternoon use ( since they force me rate it ) i gave 8 " chef five stars	1

although it effective any similar heater , it some annoying design features . display only stays few seconds after changing setting . i don't know why it can't stay all time . like it isn't running batteries after all . its bright red pilot light stays long it plugged but there no indicators tell you if it , off , or thermostat . you would walk over it , bend down , attempt read dark display figure out ( you might need flashlight ) . they foolishly use same button start oscillation turn it off . turn it off you hold button down several seconds ( short tap starts it oscillating ) . fortunately i found quicker way turn it off . i just tip it enough engage tip-over safety switch it goes right off . much quicker than holding down stupid button . if you're not easily annoyed , you might like this heater	-1

ok - negative reviews this pretty out there ; they either complaining non-existant issues ( um , 1 star someone who didn't even buy it ? becuase it supposedly doesn't come 110 ? that wacky ) , or wrong expectations what this machine . bottom line this espresso maker it guts their more expensive models ( minus 3 way solenoid , which no effect how espresso made ) if you know what you doing make espresso well pretty much any model out there . over-simplify , espresso makers come one 2 basic types portafilter ( that thing handle you put espresso grounds ) . pressurized or non-pressurized . former basically pulls same shots no matter what you , long your beans fresh your grinder good . latter requires bit more art science . tamp ( compacting grinds into portafilter ) critical , you vary way shot pulled different grind size , tamp preassure tamper type . this , while harder consistently , only way properly hunt elusive " god shot " . so - onto this machine : using " perfect crema " disc just silly , frankly . fact , i don't even think there one my box . i know what it , which basically convert traditional espresso maker into pressurized one . but hey , if that what you want then buy pressurized one one myriad manufacturers out there . however , if you want model let you explore your inner barista , you need buy non-pressurized portafilter unit . money , there no way you going get better deal than gaggia . fact , there number different models gaggia line , all which basically same until you get $500 one , which comes aforementioned 3 way solenoid . sure , there different designs , some changes type frother ( don't bother auto-frothers ) but guts same , right down brass portafilter . i chose this particular one because its water capacity size drip tray , which beleive it or not pretty big deal when you pull lot shots day , i . fact , this machine beauty . get good it you'll pull shots good any machine out there , if you total tweek-head , you even pid this bad boy ( look it up ... ) . but you want more ? go check out coffeegeeek dot com read read read . synopsis : want machine keep up your growing barista skills ? buy this now . don't care art , just want quick fast espresso ? go elsewhere pick pressurized portafilter unit . oh , either way you go , you need good grinder ( gaggia mdf rocks reasonably priced $200 ) , you want fresh beans - order online one many fresh roasters out there ; it makes incredible difference	1

this blender piece junk . i used it maybe twice , each time it smelled like it fire , which kinda worried me since my cuisinart coffee maker catch fire . last night i tried make milkshakes turning wheel broke half ( part under carafe which hooks into base make blades turn ) . it broke because it starting melt center where screw goes through . i never ever buy cuisinart product long i live . i still their toaster , so i am alerting our local fire department	-1

i given this dish ( request ) my birthday it barely gotten rest since ! it works wonderfully pies tarts , but even better baked appetizer dishes or nachos . dish washes well dishwasher stacks nicely cabinets . i wish it little handles edges better gripping when it comes out oven ( it rim good hold onto , but clumsy chefs , something more might better ) . other than , i love this dish keep finding more more uses it	1
price , it amazing this steamer anything , which accounts all rave reviews . this little number not real powerful , so you don't get effortless , quick steamer results most us seek . steam output low , so you go over over garment , little improvement . forget using it linen . even thin cotton , it creates tiny spider wrinkles . you hold hose vertically prevent water spurting , which awkward dangerous , hose gets hot . you door near electrical outlet . then hook doesn't fit over thickness door , nor hose reach item hanging it . it much work ironing , but ironing , you eventually achieve desired result . steamer compact , heats quickly doesn't take up much room . i returned mine , but there may few people who like this steamer	-1
i bought this since it 14.4 i figured all stick vacs , it would best pickup , it . however , i've found you extremely proactive it work maximum effiency . previous reviewer stated she cleans " dust bin " after each use . you , plus i : 1 . clean disposable filter , one they sell replacements for2 . clean permanent filter . this one gets really dusty when it it really effects pickup . you just clean them shaking them out , but i've cleaned permanant filter my sink using dish brush . let it dry it good new :-) this kind care i no problem this my only upright vacuum 1100 sq ft house w/ 2 people 2 cats . i love cordless freedom , it makes it worth all this cleaning business !	1

global 10quot ; great knife comes very sharp edge . it rather light ( least 10quot ; knife ) well balanced . it well situated both slicing meats cutting dicing vegetables , it easy hold knife forward towards its blade quick balanced wrist action . only reason i gave this knife 4 stars not five due handle . while it dimpled it still get slippery when cutting fatty meat . i would prefer synthetic handle covering , but otherwise this well designed tool -- perhaps best chef knife available now	1

i bought this chocolate i tempered chocolate before using double boiler this seemed easier . when melting it says it melt up pound chocolate but you only supposed fill bowl certain line when it melts you third bowl chocolate not full bowl picture shows . it formed tiny lumps before it melted after it cooled 85 i poured into molds . it never set fully , most stuck molds others went crumbley . instructions you melt cool 85 only , nothing cooling then reheating 85 it says this site . i also melted some yogurt coating which worked fine other than fact you could only fill certain line although you could keep adding it melted . good kids maybe or just coatings but not temper real chocolate	-1

without purist , ( i'm wisconsin , after all ) , this very nice sashimi knife , considering price . those you who work sushi bars scoff , but this isn't $600 hocho either , not all us wish spend so much . no saya came my knife . after many sharpenings , back must leveled , very much like good japanese chisel , hollowed part comes closer edge , but this true all knives this type . money well burned , if you cut lot fish into tiny bits . it good many other things , gets lot use my house . btw - if you just fooling around or learning , get one $30 knives - they plenty good , , if you find you don't like using this type , you haven't blown bunch cash you could spent ahi or mahimahi . . .	1

i got this out frustration trying find places charge all our gadgets . we cords gadgets everywhere ! ( two pdas , two cell phones , ipod , bluetooth earpiece . ) this item helped us get organized tremedously . pros : nice sturdy wood velvet trim . door back holes each end you choose which side you want power strip cord come out . two extra slots door allow cords come through well . also comes two plug extenders allow you plug those chunky transformer-type chargers . cons : almost all my chargers those chunky transformer-type chargers , so i plug one charger into regular outlet run cord through slots . i could used probably 3 more those plug extenders b/c transformers cover up plugs power strip . maybe you find some electronic store solve this problem . it also little cumbersome set up , but long run it pays off everything hidden organized . i would highly recommend this product	1
i'm amalfi girl . i this pan it works great- most importantly , lid heavy enough weigh down sandwiches . ( trick these panini pans you must heat them thoroughly lid before placing sandwich inside . way top gets toasted same time . ) those other two , i can't even imagine cast iron pan breaking shipment ! ones must defective lot . wow ! they my sympathies	1
this little machine rocks ! sure it makes great panini , but it also grills steaks ( perfect crosshatch marks ) , grills fish , grills chicken , grills vegetables ! i use it everything , it all comes out grease-free , moist tender .... bravo	1

i've mine years it outshines every other decanter i've ever owned or used - performance well beauty table . most decanters fairly easy fill but very hard pour . guests often reluctant tip traditional , bell-bottomed decanter far enough pour it . before first trickle wine comes out , it feels like they're holding it upside down dump it all over table . traditional decanters also require some strength lift high enough twist far enough begin pouring , especially when reaching across table . i've often seen people start , put down decanter stand up get safer grip . this awkward say leas t.t he " duck " much better every count . long handle balances perfectly hand ; pouring minimum effort still stable enough pass down dining table confidence . low , elongated body decanter doesn't picked up nearly far off table or tipped nearly so dramatically fill glass . size handle makes reaching , pouring passing simple matter . notes wine purists : unlike traditional shape , you'll never need funnel fill " duck " without splashing . surface area wine duck easily comparable best traditional decanters , giving big young wines enough oxygen soften nicely table . long neck just enough " edge " bottom trap sediments . long spout allows you spot any trace sediment well before it reaches glass , gentle slope lets you pull back softly without inducing turbulence stirs sediment back into remaining wine - helping salvage final half-glass . pour control simply unmatched . crystal hand-blown sparkles like fine stemware , shape looks much more elegant table than photo any web page possibly convey . spend money . it worth every cent	1

pros : professional smoothies ( exactly like jamba juice)very easy cleanpolycarbonate carafequick ( its business very quickly)cons : expensive ( not everyone spends $400 blender)loud ( not appropriate apartment living)bulky ( its significantly larger than normal blender)when i unpacked this blender i knew right away it very serious machine . base very large heavy duty two large switches . one pulse other high low speeds . engine rated 3 horsepower power cord very think similar cord used high power drill or garage tool . unit itself geared metal socket matches toothed metal gear built into carafe . no plastic clutch break . lightweight polycarbonate carafe sits four posts , but need you hold it down your hand top it work correctly . blade four prong item splayed out broad flat blade each tooth . idea here super sharp blade isint necessary this thing spins very very fast . i quite startled when i hit pulse . this thing spins up instantly very loud . i would almost say twice loud conventional blender . said it also very high speed pulverizes frozen items impunity . i put frozen strawberries this pulverized them so well seeds not evident . ice doesn't stand chance all . this device appears more powerful than pro blenders used local smoothie place or gym . it every bit professional i would challenge anyone break this ice or other items short metal carafe . cleanup snap everything plastic or rubber . gunk under blades also not issue you just fill carafe some water quick half second pulse cleans everything base . i would caution people while this may last blender you ever buy , it not really consumer appliance . this machine much common standard blender chainsaw hair clipper . i really like it but my neighbors hate it . five stars because it lamborghini blenders smoothies amazing . but like exotic car , it not everyone .	1

i just got mine mail other day . little research word-of-mouth told me it made great coffee , guess what ? it ! first pot we brewed ( after running some plain water through it once ) best pot drip coffee i've ever made home . we took pot out soon it stopped brewing suggested other reviwes . coffee just little too hot drink black immediately stayed warm fresh 3 or 4 hours . we also able pour full caraf without spilling anything . we tried automatic timer , it worked flawlessly . smell coffee woke me up before alarm . one important note : if you concerned some reviews where people said caraf broke , don't worry . if you get " stainless " version ( select " stainless " color ) it comes all-stainless-unbreakable caraf no glass liner . it few dollars more , but it very nice unit . we ordered it amazon thru " finejewelry_4u " they included free gold filter helped offset extra cost . couple minor notes : threaded cap caraf takes bit getting used if you unsteady hands . unit also taller than your average coffee pot ( or least our previous pot ) , so we pull it out under our cabinet pour water . otherwise , no complaints here , thus far .	1

we using this mill 4 months , it looks great table , but that it . it grind pepper , but adjusting it very hit-and-miss ( mostly miss ) , it won't hold adjustment very well . fine setting , it works ok , but it nearly impossible get coarse grind out it - it seems go fine medium , then too open grind all . we got better results out 20-year old no-name pepper mill . i would not buy this mill again	-1

i've using tefal ' maxifry ' dry fryer some time but it two ' problems ' prompted me look alternative : it difficult clean lowest temperature setting 302�f . i like blanch potato fries low temperature before i crisp them up high temperature - purely matter personal taste . this not possible tefal it could not set lower temperatures . after reading various product descriptions reviews it quickly became apparent waring apparently best products - albeit cost . i looked df200 df250 but nowhere could i find explanation differences them so i opted df250 it only one mentioned waring website so i assumed it would later model . price i paid ( 6 times what i paid tefal ) my expectations high - it seemed what i looking : easy clean dishwasher operation down 175�f . unfortunately i disappointed this product following reasons : 1 . amazon clearly states their website df 250 food capacity 3.75 pounds ( it even says this image below box i'm typing ) but waring packing manual lists this only 2.2 pounds - significantly less than advertised . 2 . i sold idea immersion heater heat oil i thought this would more efficient than external heater . unfortunately because this heater occupies so much space inside oil vat , twice much oil required , thus this potential benefit immersion heater lost . it also means cost replacing oil effectively doubled . 3 . temperature control awful seems swing over 50�f range - one moment food cooking too fast next it seems cold . i've seen it turn off 45 minutes once it reached temperature ! i don't know if it really designed this way or there fault thermostat this unit . effect , i'm back manual control ( flicking switch off ) i use tefal maintain temperature 260�f . 4 . basket handle sticks out unit ( out counter top ) so it would very easy catch this someone walked . i would very concerned young children around this unit when oil 375�f . ihe tefal nice safe fold-away handle . 5 . next issue may seem bit trivial but it annoyed me . large lid df250 removable . fact it needs removed order practice safe cooking techniques ( like slowly immersing fries into hot oil ) . so where should very hot big lid safely put down ? you need some extra space around this unit operate it something put lid not damaged hot metal . tefal , lid hinged up . stated above , unit cook food nicely - it shame i stand guard over it continually adjust it while use . this price i expected better . my old tefal looks good comparison .	-1

professional like sharpening home good price . i love this sharpener trust it performance good knives . magnetic guides make sure you sharpen knife correctly so go ahead , run your expensive knives through it ; it great job	1
i thrilled when i first began use this project - it very sharp very strong , crunching through small bones ease . however , safety lock bad place - it small easily engaged , quite few occasions now , mere action cutting - when lock gets sideswiped chicken itself - engage lock , then i manually open it up again . it extremely irritating - i would call it major design flaw . if it weren't lock , i'd reccomend these shears anyone - but i'd hesitate recommend them now . i deal them , i'm sure there way learn live them well ( after all , they cut beautifully , so long you avoid activating lock ) - but i don't feel there should need " break-in " period new pair poultry shears	-1

i purchased this set my mother who falls drops things regularly due disability . i wanted dish set her would difficult break . so far , these held up well . fact , they're deceptively durable , they look nice . however , complain ( i like complain ) , i would say this dishware too costly . i've recently seen ads similar dishware more reasonably priced . these also too light my mother taste . they slide around her table very easily ( though it nothing place-mat can't fix ) . oh yeah , they took long time delivered	1
i bought this because it looked great , but it turns out it very functional also . it looks great counter since it stainless steel , it quite heavy there no danger tipping . i worried lids weren't tight enough because they just pop , but i cereal it over month still fresh . bigger cereals come out little more difficulty then smaller cereals , but they don't come out crushed . bins big enough so entire box cereal fits it once . mine didn't smell bad like some reviewers said after putting couple pieces together it ready go	1
i , like few others , am shocked good reviews some folks given this machine - if they pets , they obviously light carpet can't see pet hair this machine doesn't pick up . i two large dogs ( german shepherd shepherd mix ) house . we dark green carpet throughout our living room , dining room , stairs , light carpet other areas our home . we previously bought inexpensive eureka boss machines worked great year , but because we vacuum least hour day , we replacing vacuums every 1-2 years . i bought this machine few months ago extremely unhappy it ( threw box away could not return it store or it would gone ! ) . i spend least 2-3 times longer vacuuming , trying get hair out our dark green carpet . you can't really see it light carpet their always lot hair dirt canister , so it seems work just fine . attachments real pain use , so much so i don't even bother any more . i only wish i gone consumer reports first , they also not rate this machine very well , especially picking up pet hair . buyer beware !! ( ... or least keep box try it out first , so you return it !! )	-1

i owned overgrown set these knives 4 years now waited until i significant use comparison write this review . i also own similar knives wusthof classic compare directly . this review copied other henckels international classic reviews i wrote modified slightly particular item reviewed although i left comments other knives . disclaimer : i enjoy sharpening knives so edge retention rarely issue me i probably sharpen even my best knives too much . besides stone sharpening every 6 months or so , i also steel my knives just every time i use them . bottome line : i really love this set knives ( although i got one dud bunch ; only reason i am not giving this line 5 rating ) . edges almost if not just good more expensive knives but finish lacking ( although only somewhat ) . relatively great value . i not feel like these knives very sharp out box but they take scary edge quite easily keep it long time ( many , many months regular steeling home use ) . 8 inch chef : this very nice knife if you get over fact finish not nice higher end stuff . this i mean edges handle bolster sharper than they my wusthof classic . it takes holds edge well . i also own wusthof 8 inch chefs knife feel like this one takes just sharp edge . i yet determine difference edge retention two lines , so means they least comparible . much i thought i would enamored wusthof , i really don't believe additional cost worth small amount performance gain you might get buying wusthof . truth , i still enjoy using henckels international chef knife just much wusthof . heft wonderful curvature blade ideal chopping . i really like how point taperd very thin blade . finish aside , this right up there best them allows user slice point quite effectively . 6 inch chef : my wife swears this knife it consistantly one sharpest we own . some reason ( perhaps thinner blade ) , it holds its edge like sharp little devil it . this knife true pleasure own use . it very effective feels wonderful my hand . i may becoming knife snob , but i see no reason buy any other 6 inch chef knife , all you would getting fancier name smoother edges handle bolster . we reach this one multiple times each day it retains its edge far better than expected price . 4 inch parer : i don't like this one much my wusthof parers but my wife likes it much better . it always one she reaches ( many times per day ) . i personaly prefer thinness flexibility wusthof parer blades . this one quite rigid although it very sharp , it not seem sharp thinner wusthof parers , nor it hold its edge long . other hand , its size perfect parer , coming sweet spot 3.5 inch wusthof 4.5 inch wusthof parers i compare it . i would love own 4 inch wusthof parer . aditionally , diminished depth blade probably preferable deeper wusthof parer blades tasks such peeling toward you . i bought one these my mother it good test edge retention she rarely sharpens never steels . [ ... ] . 6 inch utility : i not use this knife much . it seems quite redundant my 4.5 inch wusthof parer ( which also not see much use ) or my favorite boning knife ( beat up resurected chicago cutlery 5 inch utility scary sharp joy use ) . truth , almost every task my kitchen quite well either parer or chef knife . i really don't see much use 6 inch utility . said , this knife sharp pleasureable use . still , this one , i would prefer thinner perhaps more flexible blade . it quite rigid makes me not want use it much . sandwiches , cheese , tomatoes , etc . it quite appropriate , but i would still probably prefer my 6 inch or even 8 inch chefs knives such tasks they thinner edge therefore seem much sharper . bread knife : aside fact this would benefit longer blade , this effective any other we tried . you don't bread knife this nice , but this one certainly job well . boning knife : i honestly never used this knife more than trial basis . it just not stack up my older chicago cutlery boning/utility knife . you can't really compare two , however , since one very flexible thin(cc ) other very rigid thick(hic ) . i strongly prefer thin , flexible boning knife . finish this knife horrible my particular set . it rounded ( not supposed ) end blade not sharpened point , leaving rounded blunt tip ( exactly opposite what you want good boning knife ) . i never able get point where i want it . i am certain i just lemon try return it if possible . so overall , i love these knives . myself my wife , they get just much use my wusthof classics . unless finish critical you or you like other people know you spent lot money , your pocketbook favor . i think these knives just good much less money	1
i bought set these glasses . i happy thick bottoms thought they would good sturdy glasses . they not last year . bottoms never broke , but they all cracked top . i would not recommend these if you children or teens aren't careful placing glasses sink or dishwasher .	-1
best part this fryer it ease cleanup oil easilly drained , pan holds oil comes out . also element disconnects so you really clean this thing . unit not turn if heating element isn't attached properly which nice safety feature . outside doesn't get hot i thought it would though i'm sure you could still burn yourself if you touched it any long period time .	1

if you like product light weight , sturdy aesthetically pleasing , then this measuring cup you . difference use this item normal pyrex quite pronounced ; it pours better , handles better because it so lightweight . you also won't spill things readily , because there enough'slosh'room allowed after you fill it top , 1/4 cup . just don't bang it around , it won't take much abuse pyrex , but small price pay	1
i feed my cat small amount dry food twice day . this only automatic feeder allows you control portion ( least small amounts ) reasonable capacity ( 6 holes ) . this second one these i've purchased ( amazon price ($40-50 or so ) significantly less than first one i bought ($60-70 ) , i got first one cheapest price available -- time it wasn't offered amazon ) . anyway , i bought second one so we could leave cat home alone longer 3 max days time . second feeder allows us go out town few days longer peace mind he'll continue fed properly time.it easy use , easy clean , relatively solid construction . my cat tried figure out ways trick it open , so far it hasn't happened ( unless it low batteries -- see below ) . although this best auto feeder market moment , there some things would improve it greatly . we've using original feeder couple years now , but motor/middle section doesn't seem reliable mechanism i wouldn't surprised if it up died one day . same time , it going almost every day past 2 years pretty reliable . we remove button advancing feeder couple months , since it got stuck top turning continuously . now we just use pen or stick finger into hole press button . not big deal , but little ghetto.it drains batteries little quicker than i'd prefer , but it not terrible . when battery running low , it malfunctions different ways . sometimes it'll only turn halfway . other times it'll turn partially then reverse itself -- these instances my poor cat couldn't access his meal . other times , it'll turn when it not supposed -- these instances my cat got more food than he supposed quite happy . also , clear plastic flap covering middle controls broken off -- part my cat attempts trick system . again , just superficial thing since it hasn't affected functioning so far . digital control more options low-battery indicator would improve this feeder greatly . ultimate feeder would like petmate le bistro feeder but could dispense small amounts not allow pets figure out how pull out food themselves . my cat would figure one out so quick probably get so fat . so this feeder still much better than anything out there moment . i would still recommend it	1
it soft medium-sized . didn't pay too much them so didn't feel too bad when friends would come over ask if they could take one . now i don't any left , but they're interseting little soft " stuffed animal " kind thing . no real practical purpose probably - i heard it horror if it ever opens/spills its contents . it kind funny - thing itself soft - but it comes huge box tons air pillows ( when you order it amazon least ) . so if you're moving need packing material , then here 2-for-1 special .	1
this set wonderful it includes everything you really need cutlery set . most commercial stamped sets include upwards twenty knives , but you'll end up using five or six regular basis . quality these forged blades stunning edges razor sharp . proper honing , using steel included set , these blades keep their edge over year daily use . i would recommend finding local bladesmith edge sharpened professionally . it isn't expensive maximize performance . handle itself comfortable balance feels natural . although manufacturer says these dishwasher safe , i would suggest immediate hand washing after use complete drying before returning it block .	1
i bought one these towels quest satisfy my sweetie desire thick , soft , huge bath sheet gets softer use but stays thick . nine months down road , i'm happy report this towel all those things , no loose threads or snags . i can't say one way or other whether anti-microbial feature makes any difference -- but towel never stinks , which good sign . amazon price good investment towel around many years	1

i bought this pillow one reason ... headaches . i recently became pregnant my second child advised sleep my left side . which would perfectly fine except im belly sleeper flat pillow goes it . i literally same headache 2 weeks after i began sleeping my side . i chose this pillow because my also pregnant sister recommended it . after using it afew months it works great . no more headaches ( my neck anyway ) . reason i give it only 4 stars two reasons ... it heavy ... you cant grab it off bed lay couch when your sick or prop it behind your back read bed . after our baby comes im well healed ( back sleeping my stomach ) ill probably pass this my husband ( who even now trying steal it)and get water pillow so i little flatter pillow(this one nice thick	1
" bristles " this brush pretty odd ; they're wide flat made silicone . they really don't look very effective , yet they're surprisingly useful . they trap liquids them quite well . this means more what you're brushing onto your food goes onto your food instead dripping all over place . better than , you won't any more bristles getting shed into your food . i'd almost given up traditional pastry brushes because phenomenon . you also fit this brush into your dishwasher , which means--gasp!--it'll come clean ! normal pastry brushes such total pain clean this alone makes this brush worth i t.t he handle -- which screws apart head -- ergonomically shaped pliable , making it easy hands . it also hollow , allowing you fill it basting liquid ( or other liquid you want brush onto something , such melted butter pastry ) , dripless valve head helps keep basting liquid coming out when you don't want it . since brush handle translucent you even see how much basting liquid you lef t.t hen there brush stand . normally when using pastry brush i lie it flat paper towel or plate or prop it awkwardly against something . cuisipro brush you just tuck it vertically into its stand . it nice , flat base keep it upright , it contains any mess , leaving you only stand wash -- which just go into dishwasher rest brush parts . brush separates into three parts -- handle , head stand -- washing . it would pretty tough wash thoroughly hand , so it really helps able put it through dishwasher . you should tuck it into utensil cage or something similar , however , because head small potentially easy lose . all all , i no reservations recommending this pastry brush , expect get much use out mine	1
if you're looking inexpesive racking large capacity cellar you're creating , this it . if you're looking decorative rack your dining room , look elsewhere . think this more kit than rack . $65 i paid it , if they only included 2 plastic coated steel grids it would well worth money . you use these few extra pieces wood make almost any kind rack you imagine . you use it upright ( 66 " tall ) or sideways ( 29 " tall ) , or good pair bolt cutters , you cut through 1/4 " rods make fit odd sized or shaped areas . again , price you aren't losing much if you throw away few pieces . it comes backets mount it up against wall , if you take approach , wall necessary becomes part rack . brackets place grids 5.5 " apart which designed support straight barrel part bottle . plastic coating racks makes them very slippery when contact glass bottles , so if front rear grids level , vibration over time might cause bottles fall out . becuase this , brackets designed hold front grid 1/4 " higher than rear grid . this means bottles slide back where wall stop them . that why wall important ! i put my rack basement where i didn't wall mount it . so i built couple wooden ends it few wood braces middle keep grids correct distance . i also placed grids 7 " apart instead 5.5 " brackets dictated , front grid same height rear grid . this allowed me store bottles bottom main barrel resting rear grid neck resting front grid . this position , part bottle hangs below grid wires so it can't slide forward or backward . it also places bottles slightly cork-down which some may argue better or worse than level or slightly cork up . i used pressure treated wood stailess steel deck screws stand up years humid cellar . i used nylon 1/4 " cable clamps attach grids wooden ends . i just cut some 1/4 " slots 7 " apart few pieces wood support middle keep grids right distance . any case , its great rack you make into just anything few pieces wood couple hours work . it won't hold larger bottles previous reviewer mentioned , but i plan just get smaller rack hold few bottles won't fit this one . it hard better this price	1

like much le creuset line , these dishwasher safe round silicone hot pads multiple uses . covered ridges they make excellent trivets resting hot pots pans while allowing air flow . ridges also make these perfect set eggs so they don't roll off counter . they firm enough use fan when little air movement would come handy . combined ridges , they flexible enough opening jars bending/gripping around medium large handles . only drawback they don't work well smaller sized handles . this makes using these pads other le creuset product like pate terrine or au gratins pretty much useless when it comes grabbing moving them . pros : useful versatile sturdy heat resistant dishwasher safe cons : cannot effectively grab smaller sized handle	1
you can't go wrong le creuset bakeware , there so many uses these colorful little gems . i use them hold variety dipping sauces other condiments , they add really nice touch presentation when making individual desserts , like apple or peach cobbler . they also used hold small-size snacks , like nuts . quot ; flamequot ; quot ; jadequot ; also great colors	1

beautiful - heavy duty - easy use . hardest part this item getting it out all boxes . i must compliment smart bargains amazon amazing packaging . i read instructions , washed it made veggie soup minutes . i made brown rice minutes - perfection . i play timing becuase 1st time i cooked it few min . too long bottom layer stuck . i now spray cooking oil pan then put rice add tspn or so oil water perfectomungo rice . i made potatoes ( even peel ) - roast - veggies , it all good . flavor throughout food items . i researched many cookers before i purchased this one i am sooo happy quality value . i love they gave 2 sized pans i often use shorter one other things well ( they give lid use this way ) . only thing i find not 100% positive inside pan ( cooking part ) discolored bit ( rainbow like color ) i didn't know stainless steel could . it not affect cooking all or taste so no biggie - just observation . if you unsure , get this you won't sorry	1

over years , my wife i tried all sorts cookware . we good set calphalon stainless-steel cookware , but we've never mastered art cooking sticky dishes such eggs without non-stick pan . we've tried every type non-stick pan we've encountered . some non-stick short time only before surface gets mucked up . our best teflon pans , such those calphalon , seem remain non-stick very long time careful cleaning , but recently we've learned when heated , teflon ( pfoa ) cookware outgases chemicals definitely not good you .
