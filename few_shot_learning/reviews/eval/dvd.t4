my son over 2 before we introduced videos . there definitely those which cater younger baby lots random images , but this one great it puppet shows little plot , well discrete integrated units each seasons . unlike some other be random visuals , here visuals truly support learning objective desired . concur other reviewers well this most robust video bonus features . it both puppet shows short learning video all seasons . no i didn't care commercial either ...	1
season 3 l-word far best ye t.t he character development story come so far since 1st season , even better than season 2 . they scaled back sex little bit , but when they put it , sparks really fly . i love l-word	1
i really enjoyed this film , basically coen bros . homage film noir genre . ( i always thought name funny , since it french , yet most famous directors german , like fritz lang , otto preminger , etc . :-)) . sure hand brothers this material shown how film unfolds cool , unhurried , nonchalant pace experienced private eye or gumshoe doggedly stalking his prey . thornton great lead reticent , phlegmatic barber , if anything , he even more convincing hair than without -- even his hairpiece 50s-ish . :-) whole cast fine job their roles , both gandolfini shaloub couple show-stealing scenes . i found film climax complete surprise , tables turn unexpectedly barber , whom everything seems working out up till then . overall great film probably one coen bros . best . if you're coen bros . fan you won't find this one disappointment .	1
i loved thie movie ever since seeing it late night tv . i search long time find it video before dvd option i waiting impatiently release dvd since my vhs wearing out . gradual awakening young ta which girl truly right him sammy fong attempt disillusion his picture bride priceless although latter often cut out during late night broadcasts . ballet sublime even though you tell when they switched james shigeta professional dancer . afterall , it music story make this great .	1
james , you wrote : " ben weak , immature , stalker , lazy , bad taste women 21 unable tell his parents no when they ask him wear scuba suit their family friends . wow ! revolutionary film-making ... not ! " yes , ben weak , immature , bad taste women . his learning overcome his weakness , immaturity , bad taste women , then defy his family elaine family his coming age story . point movie . it went right over your head ! acting dead subject matter shocker when it came out ! how could you not love this movie ? maybe you need grow up little see value . watch it again few years . i think you change your low opinion this great classic movie over time .	1
maybe it because i never read book never heard hunter . thompson before this movie , but i found this movie unbearably boring so utterly pointless ! what point movie-making process while reading script aloud , they realize this isn't movie ? or maybe book couldn't made into commercial movie ? " story " if it called such , apparently journalist his fat hispanic friend ( called his lawyer ) who go las vegas write article some motorcycle race some sort or something . that completely irrelevant , because probably 5-10 minutes actually spent subject , additional 20 minutes most devoted guy actually trying accomplish task . rest just johnny depp main character rambling mindlessly variety subjects , most which deal drugs , or drug-related things . others nothing all anything . they quite literally taking every drug known mankind , movie chronicles them taking drugs . there some scenes which duo their hotel room , where " lawyer " freaks out bathtub threatens kill himself . other scenes , they hotel club , or restaurant . no matter where they , they always high some drug , johnny depp character ( thompson himself based his experience , under fake name ) rambling or talking very very quickly nonsensically . there cameos minor celebrities , some which world famous today . gary busey screen all three or four minutes highway sheriff who sexually harrasses jd character . tobey maguire even less hitchhiker who bails out car when he realizes duo stoned out their mind crazy . only moment which i great laugh beginning , where they hallucinating they attacked bats they drive down desert highway . when " lawyer " stops pick up hitchhiker , jd char says " we can't stop here ! this bat country ! " . line its delivery alone deserve movie its one miserable star . i expected better terry gilliam . if this movie attempting shocking or pro- or anti-drug or stylish or artistic some way , it obviously only most acquired taste , like group people who think consuming waste acquired taste . there no moral message here , nothing pro- or anti-drug , nothing shocking save these two aren't dead third day taking so many drugs , or stylish or artistic . not worst movie ever , but definitely one them . i don't know what orifice people pull this " great movie " idea out , but i'd like examine , find out why	-1
cheesy instructorthe instructor voice covers music background which turns you off going exercize , music itself monotonous beat not inline moves . instructor too fast follow .. cut it short i not recommend this anyone .. totally not professional	-1

perhaps this video satisfy readers lincoln various works , such sacred place , messianic legacy , holy blood , holy grail , or least show them places discussed detail within those books . dvd probably fine asset those currently reading aforementioned books . however , it simply not successful stand-alone video or video da vinci code . narrator , mr. lincoln , takes us through quaint beautiful countryside languedoc , home cathar heresy albigensian crusade , points out some interesting details his wandering . yet he rarely ties details together into coherent picture , often makes comments would seem undercut very idea he intends create coherent picture . well , he relishes showing destruction wrought many these mysterious details treasure hunters vandals ( many inspired , it would seem , lincoln books ) repeatedly editorializes against their actions . i finally fell asleep around 90 minute mark --- i cannot imagine what else mr. lincoln could found drone remaining half hour .	-1
old dvd 1997 looks better than new hd version . i've compared two , first dvd good color saturation , dark blacks looked right heavy red brown palette . hd version blue-green haze covering everything picture too bright . they also removed film grain made image look smooth creamy . sound quality better now , though , image course higher resolution .	-1

this movie many ingredients make it truly great , including phenomenal cast , lead cate blanchett , great scenery cinematography . actors playing elizabeth , cecil , walsingham spoke acted admirably , each phrase spoken such honesty feeling , but words themselves rendered performances useless . director author script greatly misunderstood characters material . they should read elizabeth first biography elizabeth jenkins . it useless say movie not need historically accurate but only entertain : author director more historically accurate , they would not created unbelievable character they created elizabeth , who turn hysterical , defeatist , overbearing , childish , tyrannical , who never shows her core intelligence , her great love her people , who private core described her motto " semper eadem " , always one . elizabeth ruled her advisors , she not totally ruled them . she would not put up norfolk screaming her across council table , nor would burleigh allowed it . cate blanchett wonderful acting presence pearls thrown before swine , wasted character portrayal totally lacked any integrity , much less truth . how could director think woman he trying portray any kind real woman ? ending me blushing embarassment one all . we laughably given william cecil wimpy ineffective , walsingham mastermind behind throne . one reviews said director inspired rush play walsingham much like hindu god krishna . i suggest he should first read some english history	-1

let me accept fact lotr my most beloved film i already own extended editions films one set ! i'm really not surprised see new line coming up edition trilogy . films like these they squeeze collectors much they !! still , inspite this new set containing both theatrical versions extended cuts films also much hyped costa botes documentaries , my advise anyone buying lotr first time is- not buy this set ! spend little more you get all movies full 6.1 dts ex glory , alongwith hours endless in-depth bonus features which probably you'll spend rest your life watching !! please aware , these new editions not contain dts tracks , no commentary tracks director , weta workshop or cast . all you get both versions crammed into one single disc just one documentary bonus second disc ... nothing else . it would better idea new line released documentaries separately without forcing consumer buy films again .... even this not end , once hd format gains little more acceptance , they'll excuse come up new version trilogy ! beware , extended edition set ultimate lotr experience , terms films or bonus features . go get it ... its worth all money spent !	-1
first all , who spastic genius who decided concert films change camera angles every five seconds ? this terribly anoying , especially when every third shot same audience members . this may fun home video , but not mass marketed commercial release . dance hall crashers awesome band . much fun seeing dhc concert their highly kinetic stage presence . it would great if this dvd concentrated band whole not just different extreme closeups switched dizzying rate . since dhc supposed focus , why director insist featuring so many shots audience ? it gets your nerves . i love dhc . their live cd permanent place my playlist . but this horribly made dvd only made it through three songs . perhaps if i front stage night , i would appreciate it more .	-1

this movie much better than " vanilla sky . " " vanilla sky " mostly copied " open your eyes " but too obvious less convincing . ( tom cruise , though good some roles , didn't fit this role well . ) " open your eyes " takes little longer draw you , but once it you there it takes you far beyond where " vanilla sky " . also , jungian dream aspect " vanilla sky " poorly , whereas " open your eyes " represents dream experience very well . i recommend watching both movies before you buy one . but if you're going buy , get " open your eyes .	1

these issues explored this film , directed alan . pakula , adapted best selling novel scott turow . it story chief deputy prosecutor rozat " rusty " sabich ( ford ) fictional kindle county , whose seemingly normal life shattered murder female colleague , carolyn polhemus ( scacchi ) . colleague whom he previously engaged affair whom he stalked when she broken off affair . any illusions you may integrity criminal justice system ( this fictional world ) swept away quickly . sabich coerced into heading investigation polhemus ' murder his boss , prosecuting attorney raymond horgan ( dennehy ) . , until horgan loses his reelection campaign new prosecuting attorney nico della guardia ( mardirosian ) his second whip tommy molto ( grifasi ) charge him polhemus ' murder . one great aspects this movie sabich , while heading murder investigation , seems very conflicted his previous encounters polhemus , who we only see flashback sequences during film . we don't know if this because his emotional sexual connection polhemus , or because he murderer himself . suspicions raised concerning sabich guilt throughout first third movie , e.g. , his obstruction his lead investigator detective lipranzer ( spencer ) ignoring fingerprint evidence . this becomes ammunition against him later when he becomes defendant . sabich wife barbara ( bedelia ) throws gasoline fire constantly nettling rusty previous affair , , most important , rusty obsession polhemus which even her death could not end . barbara tries reconnect rusty during movie , but it clear he deeply hurt her affair , rusty knows he lot atone . net starts closing around sabich fairly quickly second third movie . everyone except lipranzer ready willing believe sabich murderer . luckily , sabich hires former adversary sandy stern ( julia ) defend him . stern outstanding defense attorney , his instincts eventually lead winning strategy results dismissal charges against sabich . but , stern asks sabich later film " justice ? " forensic case prepared against sabich interesting because it predates active use dna criminal investigations . also , actions medical examiner " painless " kumagai ( shimono ) alternate comical ridiculous . nevertheless , trial centerpiece movie truly engrossing . trial judge larren lyttle ( winfield ) quite amusing speaks his mind . what we come realize middle film political intrigue , blackmail , sex influence * everyone * film . anyone even tangentially involved case dirty some respect . no one innocent . although you may guess true identity murderer before trial ends , i promise you never forget speech delivered denouement film . sabich says final minute film , " there crime . there victim . there * * punishment .

this great movie won best picture 1987 acclaimed both public critic . oliver stone directs his first movie vietnam ( second " born fourth july " , great movie ) telling his own experience going war . very beginning we see everything military they don't show when they recruiting ( ugly painful true war ) . movie goes until you see absolutely everybody completely nuts , doing drugs , killing randomly , even killing each other . this waht war men . you not human anymore . movie obviously rated violence , there some very tough scenes make anybody cry . toughest my opinion one village , when they kill -among others- mentally retarded ( course harmless ) young guy , woman . then they set village fire , rape some women , get away it . whole cast excellent , specially dafoe , who my opinion nails his character . dvd comes excellent terrific documentary called " tour inferno " ( 30 minutes long ) film stone , dafoe , depp , etc . talking movie . there also commentary stone captain there . this movie should mandatory all high schools america . if there no soldiers , there would no wars , war iraq looks lot like war vietnam . usa making same mistake again , government so blind see ( or maybe they don't care people , just business all weapons ' companies -bush ' frieds- making out it ! ) . but let smart , let just ignore government . they always get their way . let smart close all rotc programs schools . how we so hypocrites those programs schools ? education we really think our children deserve ? not happen any other place world , not even cuba . let invest money education . real education . how many trilion dollars bush wasted iraq so far ? how much money government invest education ? health ? people who live work america ? parents : teach your children . nobody should join army . let politicians -real leaders , not bunch idiots we today spread all over planet- job , we'll see how many would go . let commander chief go war himself . there no question it : there would no war . they wouldn't go . they would try negotiate , try solve conflicts peacefully . again , this great movie everybody should watch . masterpiece just not , but also makes us think , educates us . everybody should ask themselves : war ... it worth it ? what ...	1

requiem darkness far your average anime . this statement , vague but poignant , well describe essence series . it isn't normal . it delves into human psyche deranged supernatural ways , all honesty , probably shouldn't viewed anyone under age 16 . if made into movie , rating would more than deserved . but here i am , 13 years old , after watching show i'm still alive kicking . basically , if you're squeamish , requiem darkness may bother you times . satoshi kon masterpiece tends some pretty graphic stuff its openings-case point , one introduction depicts grotesque obese man rigorously chomping what could very well slabs human flesh-another shows seven women burned stakes , blood running their eyes . all fairness , those two worst cases , main body episodes usually don't contain anything close such violence . point you don't want giving this your eight year old . i've talked violence , so i feel obligated tell sexual aspects show . firstly , there very little-to-no nudity . if memory serves , there no topless scenes . not say there not sexually inappropriate episodes . one episode devoted largely scandalous sexual relationship father his ( notably over 18 ) daughter . there , well , " motions " couple flicks tongue shone . very last episode shadow woman raped depicted . so , understand first if you're too young make amazon account than you most definitely shouldn't watching this show . now , moving . while there ongoing plot , requiem darkness largely episodic till last few shows . each episode independent , singularly brilliant , entity itself . writing storytelling simply amazing , plot lulling you into trance capable rushing you forward any moment . tale usually unfolds you follow main character , author looking stories write his book " 100 ghost stories . " author gets tied affairs three supernatural exorcists , who find ( eventually ) murder excessively sinful souls . exorcists seem always know what going , while author put together facts like detective realize often strange obscure situations going around him . resulting rhythm story , simply , magnificent . if anything drawback series , it animation . many people criticize its looks , i can't blame them . art isn't particularly well . it stylistic , way i think good show . only main characters detailed faces , crowds onlookers strange , almost inhuman looking complexions . environments often warped-perhaps not fully color , or bowing like someone bent them inward . some people might think these effects bad thing . i'm personally indifferent . i'd go discussing requiem darkness , but-lo ! life harsh . if you're age , get this show . you'll not regret it .	1

jason reitman makes impressive debut director this entertaining comedy `thank you smoking , ' which more satirical than any comedies his father ivan reitman made . despite film plot one nick naylor , ace spokesperson tobacco industry , `thank you smoking ' refuses take sides while keeping us hugely entertained its dialogues . aaron eckhart delivers superb performance nick naylor , chief spokesman lobbyist tobacco industry , who his `spin ' mode easily manipulate opinions suspicious audiences tv show . nick also good father his son joey ( cameron bright ) , before whom nick tries role model . today nick thinks brilliant idea production placement - how showing hollywood stars smoking spaceship ? - he flies california his son , meets suave movie producer wearing kimono ( rob lowe ) , his free time delivers package ailing old man ( sam elliott ) who sue tobacco company . satire funny , but its target changes frequently . it could tobacco industry ( why not ) , but also could those politicians ( represented william . macy senator ) who seems very hostile nick , nick himself . sometimes story goes too far , which includes brief episode abduction , but it most effective when it shows nick darkly funny conversations his friends , lobbyists alcohol guns ( mari bello david koechner , calling themselves mod squad ) over their lunch . other cast includes robert duvall , adam brody , kim dickens , . . simmons , katie holmes . acting unanimously good , but film belongs eckhart nick naylor , or his art spin . film may lack thought-provoking ideas on-going social issues . still what you see `thank you smoking ' always amusing , clever , even absurdly funny , never boring	1
imagine you found out you going die few months . what would you ? what would you decide mattered you ? what would you think you accomplished ? what would you consider left unaccomplished ? what would you want your legacy ? those questions facing centeral character akira kurosawa ikiru ( meaning " live " ) . brilliant actor takashi shimura plays role kanji watanabe , midlevel bureaucrat who spent his entire career doing little more than protecting his own job looking busy while actually accomplishing little . one day this man learns he terminal cancer soon die . this revelation makes him start reviewing his life , he concludes he nothing worthwhile . he tries " live it up " newfound friends loose women , but this not fulfill him . he cannot bring himself tell his own son daughter-in-law his fate ; caught up their own petty problems , they seem little time old man . eventually he meet kind kindred spirit , worker bureaucracy who quitting her job because she too feels she doing nothing useful . but even she cannot help this poor man who needs love , fulfillment , sense purpose . so watanabe finds his own reason go through his final days , reason centered around doing genuine good , regardless chance reward . after he dies glory all goes lesser bureaucrats who , while previously fighting him every step way , now bask spotlight claim glory , paying him much lip service while denying him true honor . normally i don't give so detailed plot description , but i've so here two reasons : 1 ) few people , particularly america , seen or even heard this movie , 2 ) i want point out how universal themes , how this movie could easily remade today any other country any other culture any other cast . while watching ikiru i kept thinking good modern title might , " more things change more they stay same . " like so many kurosawa films , this movie , though black white old , feels completely contemporary its concerns its content . while much made kurosawa concern japanese conflict collective individual , issues ikiru resonates any culture , not just japan . these bureacrats sound like bureaucrats which we all familiar . this very deep film , filled themes existentialism movies rarely tackle . it asks biggest questions asked life . same time , it never feels pretentious or preachy . story complex , not terms plot twists , but terms its " inner life . " yet running time two hours 23 minutes , ikiru moves very quickly , feeling faster than typical 90-minute hollywood film . this probably because there lots ground cover , also because effortless acting . takashi shimura performance watanabe one greatest cinema . though shimura not widely known west , he one japan major actors 1950s 60s , kurosawa worked him often . see him kurosawa seven samuri , made just two years after this film , completely different performance , one swagger bravado . other cast members also outstanding , especially miki odagiri young female coworker . she too feels straitjacketed her job government paper-pusher , but she young not tied down responsibility so she leaves . sort date watanabe she confides she humorous names everyone department based how they behave , his " mummy . " rather than offended , he agrees her this insight helps shape his vision himself what he must redeemed . it hard believe same director who made such beautifully-composed samurai films also could direct contemporary dramas look effortless this . yet film , or third act it , also reminded me very different motion picture -- citizen kane , believe it or not . while stylistically two masterpieces little common , both deal man , recently dead , who pieced together those who knew him partially . they try make sense his actions without ever getting full picture , while we , omniscent audience , . they misunderstand his actions , ascribe many selfishness when they actually exactly opposite . ( often kane reverse true . ) only difference while watanabe fundamentally sympathetic character , kane not . also , kurosawa manages tell his story without flashy technique or set pieces . ikiru also strangely foreshadows life real japanese hero second part 20th century , yutaka katayama ( or " mr. , " he called many ) . katayama head nissan motor west coast division north america 1960s 70s . he brought task when nissan piddly carmaker no consequence , especially north america , which then ruled big , powerful ford gm cars . though katayama not motivated thought his impending death , he hard-working wanted succeed america , which he through steady , unflagging determination . but he also went against grain japanese business protocol , encountered wrath his superiors tokyo . ironically , more successful he became , more he resented . ( his far less aggressive successful counterpart east coast more highly regarded japanese bosses . ) after establishing nissan major player america , katayama unceremoniously retired superiors moved took credit his work . he died obscurity , but today mr. revered figure nissan , even used advertising campaign several years ago . executives now dislocate their jaws praising him . it all sounds too familiar . second dvd two features , 90 minute documentary kurosawa own production company his working methods , wherein he discusses everything writing scripts editing final product ; 40-minute feature making ikiru , cast crew interviews . both docs excellent you watch ikiru more intelligence after you see them . there also film trailer commentary track which i confess i haven't time listen . it stephen prince , author warrior camera : cinema akira kurosawa . criterion once again standard which all dvd makers should aspiring . print , while scratched battered bit age , good we're likely see . it unfortunate many years kurosawa work not better taken care . like nissan mr. , he without honor his own country , because he considered " too western " his outlook . like mr. , his name now evokes nothing but praise his homeland . fortunately , work this " mr. " finally preserved . ikiru film you should investigate even if you've never seen japanese movie before , even if you've never heard akira kurosawa , even if you " hate " foreign or black white films , even if you think you no interest subject . because subject fact very modern universal , you quickly swept away relevance story . ikiru very dictionary definition term " timeless classic .	1
woman sets out rescue her sister afghan city kandahar way meets displaced persons war , refugees , starving , walking wounded . film focuses particular women children forced survive under hostile conditions . their marginal existence desert sands border iran afghanistan reflects their status within taliban-ruled country which they live exile . even more dramatically , film explores plight those who lost limbs land mines . particularly informative commentary actress nelofer pazira included dvd . her comments reveal eloquent detail not only making movie ( shot where it takes place ) but rationale behind creative choices made , often fly , film crew worked under difficult dangerous conditions . while western news coverage continues focus military political aspects warfare middle east , " kandahar " much reveal devastating impact noncombatants . definitely worth seeing	1

it must made huge difference me i saw movie before i read book - i 3 little girls - based some other reviews this movie . i really enjoyed movie ( my girls - they watch it over over ) . it just fun sweet . i really enjoyed " modern " comic spin fairy tale , medieval setting . i couldn't wait read book . i admit i little bit confused when storyline turned out different , but i continued read i really started appreciate common themes movie book - how they'd chosen portray them movie . i also appreciated book its own . i glad it different movie . it same yet different way made it fun read . i didn't already know how everything going go or how it would end - except general " happy ending " sense . after reading book i could also understand why they chose put story screen way they . my perspective anyway , i think put it onscreen exactly book would taken some magic out it . it definitely magical just right book but movie i really think it would come across cliche - just telling cinderella story . instead , movie honored themes book while stepping things up screen - spinning story differently making them bigger than life/outlandish ( if you ) . highly entertaining i'd recommend book movie anyone - especially if you little girls . just remember - get best out both - watch film first	1

after reading very positive reveiws this late 90 thriller i decided it deserved least rental . i must confess i am glad i happened stumble upon this movie amazon because it everything horror movie should . screenplay very put together , plot setting intriguing yet mysterious killings ( or cinematography if you want make it sound all fancy ) visuals quite impressive it 500,000 $ dollar budget . now , only real complaint i say film acting horrid . now dont get me wrong not all acting bad but i would lying if i said most actors okay , truth most them very little experience made film look all-around quite bit less professional hard look elite horror film . i think if producers would known when they made film it would so well such great reveiws number veiwers than they would more than willing dish out few extra bucks order some more experienced actors . i thought david hewlett played david worth ( architect ) acceptably i also thought nicky guadagni performance helen halloway ( doctor ) pretty good . other than those two i thought acting very lightweight . guy played quentin ( cop ) really bad which quite shame just because characte big role film really important ... also i thought they could gotten better more experienced guy play role autistic boy ( or man it some what hard tell ... ) . i know i keep going acting but i cant wonder away truth much . concept idea film really quite brilliant , screnplay brilliantly written story line meshed extrodinary ease . despite acting i heavily impressed film overall very good . grade : b+	1

you remember 2000 election ? well , you probably , well , if you're looking this dvd first place , you probably remember feeling angst one way or those days post-2000 election night . well , greenwald doesn't attempt spurn those feelings ; instead , he shows why decisively both sides aisle ( but admittedly more anti-republican focus ) , 2000 election farcical debacle . this one many dvd come out after election , but greenwald films appreciativeness speed , accuracy , quality , which many frankly lack . critical sources consisting authors , florida community leaders , many other people add their two cents this film give even more depth credibility . even danny glover takes role ' conductor ' if you , through least bit film . overall though , film cut quick it needed , should remind us not what wrong our voting system , although it plent . but what we make it better , why fight voting rights ever eventful fight	1

much written miscasting john travolta bill clinton this movie . not much written emma thompson casting . arguably , emma thompson , star movie versions jane austen stories , would just badly suited hillary role travolta bill . hillary raised suburban chicago , no apparent ties england , far genteel , reputation . however , emma wonderful hillary ; fact , since trashing bill clinton little further purpose , hillary-watching promises much more fun future . so who hillary seen not only writers but also emma thompson ? she compassionate , calculating , flawed , hyper-intelligent individual . she , written movie , " more moral " than bill so far observing code personal conduct , but " less moral " politics . movie would it , she would hesitate lot less than bill using relatively brutal political tactics . she shows great willingness externalize her feelings , accepts very little personal responsibility . like so many us , she sees where noble ends might justify means , expects others around her same . this remarkable performance . hillary star continues rise future ( it almost certainly ) , this movie might become sort emotional lynchpin understanding very complex very fascinating person	1

" fog " fairly typical representative john carpenter movie . it certainly its moments , yet it leaves viewer unmistakable feeling " what might . " this sense it reminds me bit michael mann 1985 version . paul wilson " keep " , fascinating yet flawed horror movie which i watch over over again vain hopes discovering it actually good . stripped bone , " fog " story small new england fishing town which celebrate its centennial ( or bicentennial .... or anniversary some type ) . eve this occasion local priest , drunken sot played hal holbrook , discovers town - like all horror movie small towns - terrible secret linked its founding . this discovery coincides appearance nasty fog off coast which tends leave dead people its wake , moving towards town . various characters town , including local beer-guzzler ( tom atkins ) nubile hitch-hiker ( jamie lee curtis ) radio deejay ( adrienne barbeau ) so , all isolated fog soon discover what inside it , how it related " terrible secret " , old sin which modern-day townsfolk mist pay . you see , while idea not exactly new it pretty cool , when i popped " fog " into my ancient dvd player recently i so after hiatus many years , hope my earlier judgement film wrong . this i disappointed . like " keep " , " fog " never gets any better ; unlike " keep " it actually gets worse . paper this should not happened . besides carpenter , who coming off well-received efforts like " assault precinct 13 " " halloween " there impressive cast actors which actually reunites good bit original " halloween " crew . besides carptenter jamie lee curtis , there also girl who played annie ( michael first onscreen victim ) , well guy who played sheriff both h-2 . replacing ubiquitous donald pleasance hal halbrook , venerable john houseman makes appearance film opening creepy , storytellin ' sea captain . even janet leigh involved , bitchy yet rather likable wife fog victim . ironically , tis part film problem , it many . first off , there far too many characters . film cluttered them some reason carpenter disobeyed standard horror movie order whittling them down film progresses . most victims throwaways no way integral plot , nearly everybody introduced beginning still walking around end . we needed more killings , not less . second , performances . this movie good actors , but dialogue best inconsistent worst embarrassingly stupid . worst it ladeled onto adrienne barbeau , who gets repeat idiocies like , " my son trapped ! trapped fog ! " " look out , into darkness .... beware fog ! " gag . third , villain(s ) . carptenter achieved some neatly creepy atmosphere beginning film , but he never delivers it : there no real payoff . this because he couldn't seem decide whether it fog itself or what fog actual " baddie " film . result no one antagonist ever really emerges . " fog " might well run o ' mill flood - faceless impersonal . movie its moments -- creepy opening , moments atmospheric horror sea , excellent cinematography , which used particular effect creepy fog-dwellers . but end these fail outweigh movie many flaws . today , i still regard carptenter most wildly inconsistent director out there . one hand he gave us p-13 , halloween , escape new york , thing , all classics ( cult or otherwise ) . other hand he also gave us crap like prince darkness unwatchable ghosts mars . there fun but flawed outings like they live mouth madness . i would like say fog falls this last category , but i really can't . it just isn't very good , that sad fact it . bottom line ? beware fog .	-1

' vanishing ' reminds me woody allen film ' match point ' which i also watched recently , they're both thrillers which approach their subject matter very flat , realistic non-sensationalistic manner . creating outlandish criminals schemes rushing over them so we don't notice how absurd they standard thriller formula . these films , however , take relatively simple believable acts violence examine them depth . sense , they're opposite thrillers , slow deliberate , all building up finale which proves surprisingly affecting , certainly more affecting than traditional thriller climax . unlike most people here , i won't tell you this method necessarily better or smarter . they both work very well , `the vanishing ' this more methodical approach quite well . film opens introducing us rex saskia , dutch couple vacation france . we get know them fairly slowly , they're obviously very affectionate , prove much more believable appealing couple than you'd usually find film . before too long they stop gas station saskia heads off get them something drink . she never comes back . rex becomes obsessed , continually investigates , putting up posters flyers . he this three years , he knows very well saskia must dead . nevertheless , he can't move ; he must know what happened her . this isn't single perspective film , however . we also introduced , quite early , raymond lemorne , man who abducted saskia . he doesn't seem like killer type , he apparently quite balanced family man . he seems go through plan intellectual experiment more than any thing else . he it ? he get away it ? raymond quite impressed rex persistence , he even contacts rex via postcard , leading their eventual meeting film grimly inevitable climax . again , this film very low-key . there almost no on-screen violence , my recollection , not even much strong emotion or yelling . they all almost always manage keep lid it . sluizer shot film very straight forward manner . he rarely makes any sort comment camera , but simply records what going . it doesn't conventional plot arc either , no traditional rising action or raising stakes or what you . it everyday life sort approach , approach which refuses shape story into standard movie plot form . nevertheless , it draws you , making you * need * know what happened , just rex . this film greatest supporters love tell you how intelligent this movie , but i'm not sure if i really buy argument . it not dumb movie , certainly , but there really isn't all much it intellectual standpoint . it touches themes predestination obsession so , but that nothing particularly new or remarkable this way . it require patience just different most films , which doubtless throw some dullards , but while capacity patience taste different tend go hand hand intelligence they really aren't same thing . this all say , i think stupid people tend not like this movie , but not because they don't understand it . it just not their thing . `the vanishing ' cleverly structured , though , shifting perspectives , first showing us crime rex perspective , then raymond , slowly revealing information film goes . however , i think it bit too drawn out middle , showing raymond contemplation rex rex endless attempts solve crime bit too long . beyond this , rex confrontation raymond isn't interesting it might . this point we've learned almost everything there know , so some it proves bit reiterative . still , ending packs punch , doubtless made more effective occasional slight dullness other parts film . performances surprisingly good film this cheap . mentioned before , saskia rex very likable , not movie couple all . gene bervoet performance rex probably key film . if you don't sympathize him there isn't much pull you into film emotionally . ( i , so i . ) donnadieu raymond psycho like few others i've seen film . he intellectual villain , which isn't rare , but he different because his intellectualism isn't cover madness lying underneath . he just so coldly logical detached , confessed sociopath , madness doesn't even describe his condition . he barely even human . hmm , guess that it . again , i don't think this quite masterpiece some . it still bit slow dry times , but characters intriguing enough structuring clever enough carry it . ( , again , ending quite good . ) definitely worth look if you want see different sort thriller . grade :	1

since " pianist " many roman polanski earlier movies undergoing reappraisal this should no exception . reviled time its innovative use " shocking " images linked most unfortunately charles manson/ sharon stone murder , it slumbered basement many years . today it seen perhaps first time what it : extremely subtle complex analysis way powerful organisations deform mind " ordinary " people/ or , if you prefer it , psychosis gradually take grip most normal individuals . this case organisation witches ' coven but film also seen other religious/ political overtones . particularly clever way director keeps us guessing throughout what extent rosemary ( mia farrow ) deluded her " paranoid " belief her husband neighbors plotting against her her unborn child . yes , i know , put way it sounds pretty clear cut case , but such rosemary naive honesty ( despite criticism i feel mia farrow inspired choice this film ) we continue believe , against all odds , she innocent victim . polanski staunchly refused throughout film indulge gratuitous " horror film " excesses . there no vomiting final scene which rosemary first time sees her " demonic " baby positively shakespearean its restraint , baby merely described characters ( you imagine ) opposed seen . throughout this film it mind rather than stomach working . it great movie well worth revisiting . certainly i could not see any modern director remaking it successfully . true piece kafka	1

i would rate show 5 stars , this review extras features special edition issue . i recently bought all special edition releases " stand alone complex " after trying research what i going get extras not included regular edition . i found listings amazon product details little confusing incomplete some volumes so i decided write this guide others trying decide . i'm not going review " ghost shell " episodes or series general because there so many excellent reviews already this site , most you probably know this great anime tv series already . there various other reviews say some dvd cd errors them bandai replace them corrected discs if you send them exchange . i not ran into problems yet , although i haven't gone through whole series either . i also state i love tv series well both movies , but i would recommend imported region 2 version gits2 : innocence if you region free dvd player . dreamworks really messed up release omiting english dub putting hard hearing subtitles instead regular ones early issues movie . most people find them very distracting annoying . first off discs themselves , you get two dvd discs each volume same episodes both discs . volumes 1-5 4 episodes each , 6 7 3 episodes each making 26 episodes total series . both discs anamorphic wide screen encoded directly high-definition masters . both discs also english subtitles . each set also two interviews voice cast or someone associated production anime , printed dvd insert pamphlet or booklet different interviews such each volume . all discs region 1 . disc one dolby digital 5.1 japanese english , dolby digital 2.0 english japanese . disc two dts 5.1 english japanese dolby digital 2.0 english track . volumes 1 2 include soundtrack cd music yoko kanno , most excellent versatile composer music tv series . anime lovers know her work many fine soundtracks she countless other anime movies tv series . volume 3 black xl fruit loom tee-shirt section 9 logo front major kusanagi graphic back . nice shirt ! volumes 4 5 collectable i.d. cards section 9 member . volume 6 black xl fruit loom tee-shirt section 9 logo front batou graphic back , i.d. card . nice shirt again ! volume 7 tee-shirt ! this time it white xl section 9 logo front , laughing man logo back ! once again nice shirt ! it also comes tin box that supposed hold all 7 volumes dvd set . i excited getting box but when it arrived i disappointed design . it kind like rectangular lunch box you used take school kid , without handle latch . its also thinner metal dents easily . it marketing type printing backside pertains vol . 7 only , dvd cases stack inside one top other . spines cases not visible when you open box , only front last case you put . so you take all cases out tin get specific volume . there also not room cardboard sleves dvd when you got individual volumes , no room soundtrack cd either . all said , i disappointed box . because it odd dimensions it doesn't stack well my dvd library . i would much preferred normal five sided box usually comes dvd sets . overall i'd say it worth it buy volumes 3 , 6 7 new get shirts if they interest you pick up others used if you save some money series . if you're interested dts soundtrack options . i much prefer dts mixes dolby digital wanted soundtrack cd well . also cardboard boxes come volumes 3 6 better than tin box store your set when you complete series , if you stack them shelves one row dvd top row , you fit movies into those boxes well fill them rest way	1

well , i'd agree tweedle " fan service " pencil cards over top , but only because they inconsistent characters series . series very good character development , lots good back story early . only " fan service " episode " heart darkness " , which shows bare chested woman , but she not one main characters . it doesn't seem very provocative me , since there no emphasis sex , character only trying keep her clothes dry . still , this feels like " filler " episode , doesn't really contribute story . plot inconsistent seasons . heart darkness , girls search ancient key books , but episode 14 ( set up second season ) , we find books not ancient ... i like art this series , it hand drawn feel it , lots attention detail . i'd definitely buy it again	1
i've devoted pilates practicer over 6 years , somewhat sceptical any kind workout tried turn classic pilates into more aerobic-type exercise . still , i ellen barrett dvd ( self sleek slim ) liked both workout instructor ( she extremely personable impeccable cueing ) , so i thought i would give this dvd go . i'm very happy report i love it . i think ellen excellent job applying pilates exercises standing mat workout makes you sweat . i love feeling simultaneously stretching stengthening my body while also burning fat . even though routine moves relatively slow pace , other reviewers pointed out , use weights really gets your heart going . i'd rather move steady pace moves properly ( that pilates principle ! ) than flail around frantic speed , case so many workouts . many people seem think unless it really fast paced , you're not getting good workout -- that totally wrong . i should add i've always found weight training boring avoided it , so i'm very happy found way incorporate some into my workout . i also think people no pilates background probably just fine this dvd , but you'd probably get more out it even some rudimentary instruction pilates . i would recommend stott videos ( also all excellent ) starting beginner pilates mat workout . i work out 4-5 times week , using this dvd least 2 times week 6 weeks now . i still look forward it . highly highly recommended .	1
this movie one greatest war movies ever . not over- statement . if you any interest ww2 want see what it really like eastern front brutal stalingrad russia , then this movie see . it feels real complete mightmare , but you ; take your eyes off screen . its like great novel , visual intensity . acting directing this german film top shelf . its almost like they don't know cameras rolling , it really 1940 russia . it starts off so well germans , we see them celebrating rare day off horrors war italy . they fresh off victory north africa deployed russia take over vital supply line stalingrad affords its russian forces . soon fighting begins horror takes ahold german platoon . you see looks their faces scene after scene , when they begin realize this one battle not going victorious . further hamper grim reality their surroundings winter soon takes icy grip unit well beginning hatred their superior officers . this one interesting aspects this film . they seem hate officers much their enemy . officers lose command control platoon , they try deperately intimidate men see things " fuhrer way " . cold ominous , this film exact feeling you would expect this battle , circumstance . 5 stars - probably best war film all time .	1
masterpiece akira kurosawa featuring toshiro mifune , this time mifune not samurai armed sword but determined executive armed 50 million yen make deposit percentage shares would make him big boss national shoes , where he worked 30 years . night he make his takeover he receives phone call telling him his son kidnapped 30 million yen ransom . without second delay he makes arrangements pay kidnapper , but then he learns kidnapper made mistake took his chauffeur son instead . what he ? part moral dilemma part police thriller high low despite 43 years old still very powerful exciting . sadly though usually dependable criterion dropped ball this dvd no extras . not even audio commentary kurosawa expert stephen prince . it still worth buying just movie alone . watch police station scenes appearance sometime kurosawa leading man takashi shimura ( stray dog , ikiru ) .	1
low budget film , yes , but it really works i really enjoyed it which surprised me no end . once again plot not rocket sciene which good when you want something ease brain watch . washed-up 80 pop star paul kerr ( craig ferguson ) who moves wales spur moment decision doing so discovers he teenage daughter , olivia , ( charlotte church ) living his new backyard . olivia result weekend affair he her teenage mother during height his fame his arrival small welsh town unsettles orderly but now very boring life his ex-lover rebecca ( jemma redgrave ) . we treated fun galore paul tries get know his daughter whilst trying woo her mother back into his arms . olivia turn her own problems her mother , rebecca doesn't want her become involved music industry , her own father aging rocker who always road his band man she loved seemingly abandoned her his career . anthony head ( giles buffy vampire slayer ) paul foul breathed manager treat , there some great funny moments , like when paul finds out his best friend girlfriend scottish she just happens called nessie , scene motorbike when paul rebecca race london " rescue " their daughter hilarious , you see sparks attraction flying them scene hospital hysterical pub scene when locals worry possibility " americas moving , " not mention soundtrack film lovely , especially all songs charlotte church brings life her glorious voice . this lovely film cast fine characters ; look out joss ackland rebecca rock-a-billy father , phyllida law olivia teacher imelda staunton rippingly good form po-faced dr bridget	1

this very underrated movie . hollywood courtroom drama manages almost totally avoid clich� ...? one scrapbook maybe . what i liked most it almost complete lack explanation motivation ( shades david lynch here perhaps ) most notably schlichtmann character , brilliantly underplayed john travolta . who could ever imagined said ? indeed all top stars (+duvall , macy , shaloub ) rein histrionics , which one reason why you watch this . what really made him change typical materialistic lawyer into people hero willing risk everything , well , you make your mind up ? word hero out place here , however , perhaps more disturbingly also so villain , film deal terrible crime . but then perhaps banality crime what it all . or should . whatever your view , you not go away without thinking some very searching questions concerning relationship law , justice human suffering . film ends perhaps one finest pauses cinema , travolta , faced bankruptcy , attempts vain answer judge question : where it all go ? see it	1
i only worked one office month i relate lot things this movie : printer barely worked times , overdemanding boss , rules regulations feeling any kind profit you're not going see dime it . unlike certain comedy movies which based primarily disgusting , rude or people getting smacked things , office space gets its laughs moments where you go " i know someone exactly like " . peter 2 friends work initech , computer company prides itself making workers what they've told . after hypnotherapy session , peter becomes carefree uninhibited but he gets promotion . how get back them ? put virus computer system takes remainders transactions puts them separate account . they get caught ? one great things this movie it seems take itself seriously while fun same time . while there no big comedy punchlines , film quite funny certain personas we've met such slooow tallllking guy ... mmkay ? or bosses restaurants making demands while saying it up you if you want it but i'm gonna whine if you don't . acting-wise film straight across board . while i only know 3 cast members(obviously jennifer aniston others dave herman , voice actor futurama john . mcginley ) , everyone perfect their roles even spout some great one-liners too . my favorite : neighbor , overhearing peter plan gone awry , declines offer visit peter saying " that ok , don't want you **** up my life too . " only thing i didn't like character you're going love hate never gets comeuppance , like somebody losing it punching him . kind disappointing . how skimpy extras . this " special edition " practically one making-of deleted scenes dvd-rom stuff . no commentary ? grr , which too bad cause i would've loved hear least anybody but still this film definately warrants purchase	1
i thought movie alright , but i am sorry i bought it . i would rather just rented it . it seems like half movie out focus , i am sure it purpose but i just don't get it . there few erotic scenes but they not worth price	-1
i like it because storyline . good story all matters . i hate sub vs . dub debates . good anime transcends language age barriers . i like film quality escaflowne but most anime overrated . ignore sub vs . dub debates . good anime not altered voiceovers it more believeable connect audience better	1

i missed reading this child . when i went read reviews it amazon determine which copy purchase my nieces , all i found movie reviews . totally unhelpful ! so , my comments book , secret garden , illustrated michael hague . ( addition i read our local library currently out print , but our librarian recommended one illustrated tasha tudor which print . ) its beautifully written its wonderful read-a-loud . use english language just lovely refreshingly old-fashioned . its got drama mystery but nothing especially scary . it easily one best children books i've ever read ( currently i'm huge harry potter fan ) , though its less fantasy more self-empowerment . somewhere i read every little girl should read this book . i disagree . every child should read this book . i read it ( 2 sittings , it so mesmerizing ) now i've started read it my young sons . its real page-turner no swearing , no smart talking no violence/weapons some very important messages how treat yourself others . there lots great talking points whole family . every family should own copy	1
although season 5 not bad season 6 , it isn't one best overall . rory going downhill all way , very unrorylike some ways making bad choices . she drops out yale among other things . this disappointment , but enough going it it worth watch if you're out gilmore don't want rerun previous seasons right away	1
nick lachey jessica simpson few good moments nick jessica variety hour . but show looks too ' 70s its premise , too donny marie-ish some parts sonny cher-in some others . lachey performance babyface nice . how come babyface didn't produce nick entire solo album instead batch people nick went caused soul-o flop ? he would given him some smooth stuff sing . but mr. johnny bench kenny rogers makes show look , sadly , too 1983-ish . how come they couldn't get somebody current perform it , say maroon 5 or kanye west , who both hot last april ? they wanted bring back variety show format , but it very hard it internet age . jessica isn't all good this show . i'd rather hear her music albums instead . they need bring new things format if they're going make show . now , lachey simpson would better off doing their solo albums than wasteful junk like this !	-1

if you're looking documentary life truman capote , you two choices : * truman capote , ae dvd archives ( 2005 ) [ asin : b0009hmtfs ]; * great writers : truman capote ( 2000 ) [ asin : b000fc2hng]neither one inexpensive , so i would liked review saying which one better . it turned out , i ended up buying watching both . although both programs roughly same length , differences significan t.t he arts entertainment ( ) version clearly better . it more information , photographs , film footage , interesting interviews than great writers version , which seems trying make some sort artistic statement its own - lots pictures grass waving wind , country roads , etc ., none which terribly relevant . you better off buying program .	1
i hardly believe some reviews i'm reading here . it seems every one wants more foghorn leghorn , speedy gonzalez chuck jones . they want cartoons 50s . well , i've seen most wb cartoons over many long years , speedy gonzalezes stink ; forghorn leghorn funny once then boring ; chuck jones most overrated catroonist all times . he made some good cartoons -- matter fact , lot good cartoons -- but he made lot junk too , including some his most heralded ( like " some froggy evening " which obvious , coy not funny all . ) tashlin , avery , especially , clampett , rule . porky pig feat , ( horror horrors ! ) black white cartoon 40s ( horrors again ) may funniest cartoon ever made . clampett only director who could make bugs bunny cartoon where bugs goat still make it hilarious : falling hare best example . but my god ! that war time cartoon references a-cards gremlins its too much expect people today understand ! this set even includes what probably freleng best cartoon : she acrobat daughter , wicked send-up night movies : but , heavenly days ( little fibber mcgee molly lingo there ) there references newsreels lew lehr ( who dat ? ) leslie howard bette davis petrified forest . lot reviewers here , i'm sure , offended inclusion anything so obscure this new millenium . " thugs dirty mugs " , there joke fred allen ; " gruesome twosome " , greatest cartoons ever , there parody jimmy durante ! it seems it asking too much expect anyone post baby boom understand anything happened before television age . i liked this set reason most reviewers here disliked it : because its concentration funnier , better written , more satirical cartoons pre-jones age . black white looney tunes terrific . i agree one other reviewers , though , i'd like see some tex avery travelogue spoofs . they hilarious collections corniest gags imaginable . pc stuff--it intolerable , but we just tolerate it . these fascists control this country now ( i don't mean since recent election -- it happened way before ) we just put up it . it just curious they think we should offended some stereotypes not others . stereotypes black americans shuddered but -- why , durante spoof take off italian american ; edward . robinson spoof " thugs dirty mugs " take off jewish american . finger shaking lecture old tradition this country only thing changes what we get lectured . thing never changes hypocrisy selective morality . other reviewers here , who probably favor pc fascism ( i've read few them ) make usual , unimaginative lame accusations : we don't like pc lecturing because we're all racists . fact i don't care what lecture . i resent fact lecture all . we turn these dvds entertainment , not any lecture how evil our ancestors . if there religious lectures beginning dvds modern movies , which may offend church goers , i'm sure pinkos would crab -- rightly so . it presence not content lecture offensive . but folks , just learn take it . it ain't going away . remember , no one really against censorship folks crab most it only crab because they're not censors they're not ones deciding what gets approves . right now what generally called " left " censors our culture it their version morality decides what we see enjoy what we lectured . get used it . but pc garbage what made me give this only 4 stars instead five it deserves	1
indeed 3d effects this film make you feel if you motion simulator times it very cool experience 3d fanatic like myself . i wasn't enamored music some other reviewers here but it wasn't bad . it need bit more humor harry shearer ( simpsons , spinal tap ) work but it cool goth looking fun kids except maybe very young ones . you need standard tube set make it work included system but rumor it version lcd projectors systems not far off . untill then this best we got . dukey flyswatte	1

folks , this movie alright , it not bad . probably best-worded review i've read " ken park " so far imdb . com . i think someone named " peedur " wrote it or something . not i agree him 100% , but good taken out this film well expressed his critique . look , fcc mpaa , you don't want me see something , then chrissake don't ban it . just makes me want watch it even more . all honesty , i don't know if this film should banned here america . " kids " " bully " made it through okay , even into theaters . when it comes teens sexuality , " ken park " might clark most truthful presentation it . now i know that gonna send many parents tearing their hair out , screaming , " what i ? how i save them this ? " well ... you can't . if you don't want believe any what happens " ken park " real , then you'd better just not watch it altogether . parents , heartbreaking truth almost all what happens here happened several times continue happen unabated . i've never lived visalia , ca , but spent ample time there . however , i born spent first 19 years my life fresno ( two remarkably similar close geographically ) . same stagnant lifestyle , same tendency listen punk hip-hop , same heat , etc . i appreciate clark effort humanize these kids this time ; none them what i would call " bad . " " kids " made kids look bad . " ken park " makes kids look bored , which what they really . don't scream heavens , asking why they would think such things , that nonsense . why they smoke dope , drink ad nauseum , jerk off frivolous sex ...? because there - - nothing - else - - - there . gotta alleviate boredom somehow . instance , when devout father scorns his daughter bible ... referring her beast whore ... nope , she just teenager . all teenagers beasts whores because you can't think any other label it . i personally sex supple young teenage filipino girls their parents ' catholicism-adorned house ? actually , right parents ' bed . i only 17 time . i've challenged my father fight , i've gotten impatient grandparents taking too long turn playing game , i've sat around living room watching mtv while hitting bong bitching how i couldn't wait leave wretched town . i've it ; it happens . never jerked off womens ' tennis while asphyxiating myself robe belt , but ... it areas like these clark starts lose me . there much more male nudity " ken park " than female , so don't expecting some wild teenaged orgy . there not even much actual sex movie . fact , if main characters this film but ... 4 years older ... i guarantee you this would not banned here america . visalia - never - looked good it " ken park " never again . it photographed directed two ace dps after all , so screen composition , lighting shading all luminous ... lack better adjective : warm . hospitable . film looks more expensive than it . my favorite scenes actually opening scene very final scene . without these strong bookends , i'd easily knock off half-star . i personally detest harmony korine ( kid just pretentious skater prick thinks he tarantino 12th power ) , however i like this script ... because it ripped right out headlines . parents , this not every teenager . it really not . but it lot them . " ken park " not seek illuminate teenaged psyche en masse , but offer examples what we think tragic squalid ... rather mundane existence . rather few exceptions " shock shock sake " scenes , it deserves more credit than it given . clark best film still " bully " , but " ken park " its merits . only those less discriminating tastes , obviously . tread lightly , but if you like your cinema ignore boundaries ( la miike takashi ) this one'll send you past envelope . 3.5 stars , but i'll round up audacity	1
liza timeless . enjoyed updates this concert always her music	1
first off , i am fan original series - escaflowne . it far up there top 5 favorite anime . it lot memorable characters , good action pretty decent story . this not original escaflowne . it not take part before or after series . it doesn't take place somewhere middle . it takes most main characters series totally retells entire story fit into movie . result ? not fan . basically , because entire movie you see 30 second introduction old characters suped up animation no depth . example , twin cat girls so fond lord falcon , show up instead brief 30 seconds singers stage bar . ummm yuck . lots more memorable characters subjugated this . perhaps , if you seen this first it would decent watch . myself , i very disappointed . good points this movie animation upgraded soundtrack well . even standalone product , movie no flow or depth it . it basically just compressed retelling escaflowne . i'd rent this skip it purchase . if you want purchase something , get escaflowne series . you much happier	-1
whole piece highly artistic tasteful . extra bonus wilby , grant graves all very pretty boys back those years . initially , wilby not most attractive one . but after watching it over over again , his charm getting irresistible . i haven't seen any wilby late performance australia . anyone knows how he doing uk ? sure he great actor but luck plays main role acting career . it comfort see him interview this special collection ( maybe shot 2003 ? ) - he still quite charming even though aged little . ageless classic can't recommend enough .	1
stars amazingthe plot quite interestingthe ending amazingthe whole movie just shocking how great it what it gets presentsi'm quite happy i this dvdit seen played more times when i play it my dvd player . keanu reeves morgan freeman bright their roles . amazing movie . even title movie made me wonder what movie really when i first put it my player	1
" legal eagles " supposed comedy . we're supposed find characters played robert redford debra winger amusing , their acrimonious relationship hilarious , way they end up partners despite all gibes romantically satisfying . problem movie too dumb taken seriously , thus too dumb funny . briefly , story takes place new york . robert redford assistant district attorney promoted da . debra winger defense attorney , daryl hannah young woman emotional problems , debra winger client . plot involves fire 20 years ago , when daryl hannah eight , fire killed her artist father purportedly destroyed large number his paintings . this experience left daryl hannah traumatized , but all not it seems , now , 20 years later , daryl hannah first accused attempted theft later murder . unfortunately , plot involves many elements simply don't make sense . i won't go into detail , but roger ebert good job listing four different major things make plot completely unbelievable . well story dumb i found some scenes supposed funny anything but . example , robert redford weekend father teenage daughter . one point his ex-wife threatens go court prevent him seeing their daughter . robert redford makes telephone call his ex-wife home starts angry monologue threats how he'll take her apart court . then he realizes he actually talking his daughter ! this mistake apparently supposed hilarious . ha , ha . scene robert redford debra winger together see one bad guys . robert redford takes off foot try catch him . debra winger , who doesn't know how drive car , feels it necessary her jump into robert redford car try follow him . she makes wrong turn finds herself going wrong way into traffic wide heavily trafficked street . there follows one minute her frantically dodging cars last moment . very funny . ha , ha , ha . this movie could fairly good romantic thriller if they fixed plot not tried comedy . but dumb plot unfunny attempts comedy make it complete waste time . rennie peterse	-1
i watched troll 2 showtime beyond(showtime horror/sci-fi movie channel ) like movie itself so bad it laughable ! i mean part where joshua screams out " your genius big sister " nearly made me fall out my chair laughingthe movie takes place small town where everyone veganand like religous people there phobia towards those who eat meat they " unpure " if they eat it which ironically saves johusa movie eating double decker sandwich meatthe goblins this movie creepy esspeically one bolding eyes eek ! anyway thoughout flim joshua looking pictures creepy looking trolls which ironic considering it golibinsanyway movie only way golibins eat someone eat something so they could eat them!i'm not child but still scary thought ! after watching this movie i didn't look green red same way again nor could i eat muchonly watch this movie if you looking laugh	-1
this one movie aged , not well . it great when it came out ( i remember seeing it just after premiere ziegfield nyc ) , but looking it some 30 years later , it just doesn't stand up test time . october 74 run great , deadheads thought it last . film meant immortalize band , so . however , jerry editing , which puts too much focus scene detriment music , turns movie into documentary , rather than concert film . but , disc 2 real saver . 90 minutes great tunes - only music - including other one , dark star , china/rider , great sugaree , this may one best filmed records dead . get it disc 2	1
tom clancy movies some best ever adapted novels . though all books least twice good their movies , films still great action movies watch . quot ; hunt red octoberquot ; great movie , john mctiernen best right next quot ;d ie hard . quot ; connery baldwin both very good it , story russian nuclear sub defecting usa still enjoyable though different book . end movie very exciting . quot ; patriot gamesquot ; features harrison ford taking over role jack ryan after alec baldwin decided not it again . this one probably best three . story ryan his family london when he stops attempted assassination members royal family , he turn hunted ultra violent left-wing faction ira . this pic very exciting , also featuring great climax . last one series quot ; clear present danger . quot ; now , this one wasn't even close half good book , it almost completely different . this my least favorite because book so damn good , but it still enjoyable movie . it operation run against colombian drug cartel also kept secret president . however , when group american officials brutally killed colombians ( which spectacular scene ) , course harrison ford there , operation shut down , leaving behind american soldiers colombia . ryan ( ford ) mr. clark ( willem dafoe ) go get remaining soldiers , climax movie isn't quite intense climax book . overall , this very good collection buy , i definitely recommend it	1
john hughes strikes gold this hit classic . this film five kids who show their high school saturday detention . while there , they open up each other express their feelings , putting up each other evading their wily principal(paul gleason ) . high-strung humor laughs blend superb storytelling breakfast club(starring judd nelson bender , molly ringwald claire , ally sheedy allison , anthony michael hall brian , emilio estevenz andrew)are hillarious ! pleasant all-around film	1
this dvd first season now-classic simpsons animated series , collects show first thirteen episodes . not much really needs said simpsons , it one biggest pop culture icons ever . however , you really tell these episodes series rough around edges when it started . character designs unrefined , animation crude rubbery . stories feel like typical sitcom plots little simpsons edginess zany humour tossed , but not nearly enough it . voice-actors also still getting into character here , so their performances also different what they later matured into . luckily , fox loaded first season dvd goodies , including commentaries every episode some other fun retrospective material . presentation really nice too some original packaging disc artwork . i'd say episodes themselves three stars , but superb box set treatment bumps overall score up four . if you're casual simpsons fan , season 2 much better place start watching , thats when memorable episodes really start coming . but hardcores , this set great buy , nice start your collection .	1
denzel washington probably my favorite actor . even dog movie called manchurian candidate , he shone . tom hanks ? well , lemme quit hating guy . this well-intentioned movie , tom creditable job , we extreme close-ups funny colors camouflage spots where he overreached . i also pleasantly surprised see antonio banderas fly face his latino studliness playing gay guy . passionate one , though , since he still latino , after all . actually , this hollywood " message movie , " you know what means . it subtle michael moore . those who agree message flock beaten head it two hours . those who filmmakers would like see movie , those who don't agree message , stay far away it possible . there scene library where nobody wants sit table aids boy . way they stared him reminded me " lao wei china " experiences . denzel character reminded segregation , even though he too young remember it , started care tom hanks ' character . aids discrimination bad . actually , any discrimination all bad . that movie message . i agree message , but still . that all we've got . totally irrelevant non-sequiter , if name " sam francisco " means anything you , you've seen subtle commentary discrimination . i love great courtroom drama . this one merely good . so much agenda squeeze into two-hour film , they take few shortcuts here . sad , ain't it ? but even so , well-intentioned film i'm glad i saw . once . not twice . once enough , thank you .	-1
... which more than i say modern couple . if you expect see gwyneth paltrow take her clothes off , don't bother this movie . she plays frigid arrogant scholar , which not too much stretch her . my opinion , she not romantic damsel-in-distress material . she much more interesting when she plays cold cynical characters . jennifer ehle , other hand , shows quite bit skin . clandestine love scene two poets still stands before my eyes . i read book , so i could tell movie left too many loose ends untied . instance , it not clear movie why gwyneth paltrow character crying .	1

these types movies becoming quite trend hollywood . fight club started it ( which awesome movie ) . then sixth sense ( which also pretty good ) . after , it all went downhill . brown bunny , machinist , others , hide seek , etc . surprise endings twist , characters don't exist only main characters imagination , daed characters don't know they dead . these movies all surprising audience already overused plot twists . i predicted john torturro character figment depp imagination within first 20-25 mins film . why would actor depp status take part movie this substance	-1
this great one ! very interesting well presented , it definitely give you goosebumps toward end !!	1
this movie true garbage . it made no sense , no real plot , not offer any clever deaths or humor , or gratuitous skin . ending leaves you feeling stupid watched it all way end . i wake myself up 3 times during this movie , i wish i just stayed asleep . horror , horror . actually , sheriff kind wierd creepy because you knew he not acting ( there no acting ) you worry someone like walking around out there . i think people who liked this movie trying sell their used copies good landfill only . basically , plot make some headway end , but then they ran out money or maybe their 486 computer they using edit it died . or maybe they got bored walked off set . becuase their no explanation who killed everyone , everyone except innocent girl dead . it chainsaw killing lots scythe beheading , but i just could not care . if i could give this movie negative stars i would , but 1 star lowest .	-1
if you're craving soapy queer fix now queer folk no longer lathering it up , then queer-noir private eye thriller third man out sure soothe your ache . plot may bit serpentine dialogue stretched corners cover maximum political ground , but chad allen nuanced sexily hard-boiled performance easily compensates these shortcomings . private eye donald strachey , allen comes off spenser crossed columbo dash brian kinney tossed into this enticing mix . though ron oliver direction isn't flashy , it very appropriate noir flick set albany . like richard stevenson books -- pages which donald strachey conceived -- this film character concept tension these two dramatic elements . stevenson one first writers infuse pragmatic , ultra-masculine private eye genre unabashedly gay aesthetic . perfect synthesis these two influences , third man out gives us detective who shares waltzes moonlight martinis his hubby , drives banged up toyota tercel lay bad guys flat unsparing right hook . third man production values outstanding cable film . keeping richard stevenson albany setting smart move here ! network , so many well intentioned films go astray when they aim glitzy settings end up cheap canadian photocopies . only flaws worth citing : couple actor sebastian spence scenes ( during which he portrays donald strachey husband cross c3po uncle arthur bewitched ) heavy-handed score ( good feature songs sandbagged some very obtrusive " tension suspense " instrumentals ) . what most delighted me third man thrill watching genuine polished noir flick which , every respect , thoroughly but naturally queer . while third man isn't brokeback mountain , it milestone its own right . it well executed , enjoyable film hard-boiled detective who wears bad ties breaks out blushing grin when his boyfriend kisses him cheek .	1
honestly , this just good movie enjoyed rainy day or girlfriend/boyfriend . it not supposed great genre-defining movie , it just supposed fun . three leading ladies play their parts exactly way they meant played . cici ( sofia vergara ) bombshell , lorena ( roselyn sanchez ) strong intelligent woman , patricia ( jaci velasquez ) plays rich girl . they great chemistry on-screen their rivalry played very well . it accomplishes exactly what it sets out : fun , i can't believe people trashing it	1
i happened upon this film late one night , bravo or fx , some channel like . i wasn't planning staying up or watching it , but i found myself constantly pulled back this film i no idea what title . i just felt myself sucked into it . so i gave up watched rest it . i never so spellbound , not happy pastoral way , but nonetheless hypnotized , film i this . actresses perfect their roles . you get defeinite sense altered realities , claustraphobially close minds two teenage girls bit ' off ' put it mildly . graphic , horrifying its realities ... just amazing . once film over , i caught end where it said it true story names , i immediatly go computer read everything this case . i horrified trip i just ... peter jackson brilliant . there no other way around it . friend mine sat me down watch dead alive show me work ' guy who doing lotr . ' all honesty i little frightened lotr . but then when i saw this , my fears instantly calmed i knew he'd perfect ... this fantastic film . masterpiece certainly ...	1

david mamet shows extent his talent writer director ' spartan , ' superior thriller all right moves . mamet completely avoids cliches predictability keeping plot constantly moving challenging . bring your thinking caps this one . this story that mostly plot little else , but there nothing wrong long you rapid pacing . yes , things get complicated get there fast . i don't want go too much into plot fear giving away plot twists . basically , val kilmer plays tough-as-nails secret service agent who gets involved case kidnapping president daughter . that all i say . really experience this film , it best go cold , while plot twists flood script , they always seem logical things unfold . it also worth noting this isn't generic action film . fact there not much " action , " normal sense word . but something always happening , once mamet charges this ticking clock pulse-pounder , there no turning back . mamet also doesn't waste time trite character arcs back stories . he soley focuses plot suspense thrills . characters seem almost if they already know themselves know their role events unfold . but mamet keeps them interesting tossing small details them throughout film . all all , this great thriller deserves more accolades than it got . it highly intelligent , never boring , always challenging , super-efficient , simply superb . see it . * note * : not see trailer before movie !!! it horrible trailer gives away many films secrets	1

what disaster ! this movie complete waste time start finish . animation ugly , horrible , unrealistic three stories bland boring . what disney thinking ? oh , i know ! " let see if we eek little more cash out cinderella . who cares if we destroy beloved classic ? " several main characters completely different original movie it makes no sense . first story , king turned happy-go-lucky doting grandpa-wannabe into stuffy , sour old curmudgeon . suddenly there rule no commoners palace ? uh ... isn't there line original " every eligible maiden kingdom ? " palace full commoners night . story picks up prince cinderella return their honeymoon , so space few weeks , king completely changed . i guess they weren't creative enough come up anything would stay true characters . other two stories equally nauseating not worth my time review or your time read . avoid this mess movie . really sad thing " ugly , horrible , unrealistic animation bland boring stories " pretty much describes any disney sequel or direc t-t o-video slop market	-1

this delightful comedy spoofing spaghetti western genre . it saucy sense humor . story pair brothers . one outlaw posing sherrif hide law . other ne'er well brother who fast gun faster his dry wit . each brother his own reasons decides help group mormon farmers protect them guy who wants their valley . old brother so because he wants steal rich man horses . younger just wants steal mormon daughters . nothing taken too seriously this film including fancy production values . it comes across inexpensively made italian wester because what it . not prevent it entertaining . unfortunately , low production values seem carried over into dvd transfer . i don't know this due poor quality original film or if it just bad job . whatever case , it still very watchable enjoyable . this one not particularly edifying but it fun	1

independent film channel showing few classic horror films here lately . week or two ago , it first third " texas chainsaw massacre " films , now this 1983 classic sam raimi . i hope second film way !. this my first real viewing film i remember . i saw it bits pieces some years back , dug it , but didn't remember much film whole . boy , i've missing out !. movie unabashedly filled splattering guts grue , any horror fan relish film over top gore . this same guy " spider-man " ?. always great bruce campbell heads up small cast ash(ashley ) , who goes little outing woods three other friends . only one gets out alive . they come creepy old cabin , things pretty much go downhill there . they find odd things including book made human skin recording previous tenant . before you know it , our little group resurrected ancient evil , they won't getting out alive . soon , demonic forces start take over gang , until ash put bloody gory stop it . raimi sets right tone delivers his chills thrills nice , organic fashion . looking back these older films , one appreciates them more when comparing them modern ones fancy effects cgi . raimi doesn't skimp awesomeness idea , let it all rip bloody good fun . only thing skimpy film characters . exception ash , three other friends mainly decoration taken down most awful ways . setting itself wonderful , brilliantly shot raimi . let face it , woods scary . woods night downright terrifying . raimi uses wonderful skill make most wooded areas making them not only sinister , but making them feel if they really alive . some make-up gore effects get chintzy here there , but most time they gorehounds delight . what you expect here ?. impalements , dismemberment , chainsaws , shovels , so . it remains seen if raimi ever return his low budget horror film ways . it would too bad if he didn't because he one masters	1

constant gardener interesting case strong direction performances managing paper over plot holes some serious lapses credibility . it hard imagine two central characters ever finding themselves together anywhere but writer wishful thinking , investigation into drugs ' companies faking trials africa relies perhaps too heavily slips tongue or odd incriminating document or conversation , yet edgy but genuinely energetic direction , better performances subject matter , it surprisingly powerful involving definitely one best john le carre adaptations . perfectly cast , ralph fiennes rachel weisz limitations work roles once : his awkward , half-apologetic shtick her over-zealous head girl act right here they irritating too many other films . not all casting or performances good , however , bill nighy showing again why he better light comedy than straight drama . danny huston shows some awkward beginnings before overcoming them fully inhabiting his pathetic role spineless lovestruck embassy official - accent seems little too affected first before wearing . well worth investigating	1

1993 movie version secret garden captures magic inspiring story both children adults , while bbc television version not . it plodding style , avalanche dialogue , low production standards let inherent magic escape . no matter how hard they try , multiple repetitions word " magic " not make tv show magical . some portions tv dialogue lost thick yorkshire accents unintelligible dialect , interesting only language scholars . other extreme too many wordy explanations what we just saw happen plainly heard spoken . just because television script corresponds closely beloved book not necessarily mean it makes good television , or it captures spirit book . children capable understanding something special or wonderful happening simply watching event take place . 1993 movie clearly knows this wisely lets picture speak thousand words . movie version communicates vibrant love life . you get know unique , even eccentric , characters though they real people struggling hardships fears . without contrived manipulations , you drawn into depths heights their emotions through use stunning visuals , dramatic portrayals , pithy dialogue , moments quiet contemplation , serene musical soundtrack worth owning its own merits . tv episodes , other hand , lot effort expended but no real drama achieved . example , during what could quiet , thoughtful moments solitude , mood often spoiled voice-over or use grainy film outdoor scenes - distracting contrast clear videotape used indoor sets . i've never made so aware production methods camera angles . i'd rather just sit back enjoy . bbc actors good appear capable much better performances , but director content their shallow characterizations few instances mumbling , garbling , stumbling over their lines . several points i expected hear director yell , " cut . try it again . " unfortunately , it not up normally high bbc standards . it nice better choice	-1

season 1 " millennium " featured fantastic performances its cast dark atmosphere made " x-files " look sunny comparison . unfortunately much year ended up little more than " murder mystery week " fare . thankfully second season , supervised former " x-files " producers glen morgan james wong , changed all . second season began suspenseful ' beginning end ' , where frank black pursues mysterious polaroid man who kidnapped his wife . this episode also introduces comic relief season two , computer hacker brian roedecker . even though ' beginnning end ' would fit perfectly season 1 , subsequent episodes follow different path greatly improved series . starting second episode , ' beware dog ' , continuing episodes such ' hand st. sebastian ' , ' owls ' , ' roosters ' , haunting two-part season finale ' fourth horseman/the time now ' , we find out millennium group existed since beginnings christianity isn't nearly altruistic frank black ( viewers ) originally suspected . addition millennium group storyline , we also learn more frank childhood via two holiday episodes : ' curse frank black ' , halloween-themed tale where frank encounters ghost neighbor who committed suicide , ' midnight century ' , emotional story frank trying mend relationship him his father . latter we find out frank not only one strange gift , his mother blessed/cursed ability see angels . lastly second season even showcased two comedy episodes : ' jose chung doomsday defense ' ' somehow satan got behind me ' . these hours television completely different average " millennium " episode ( say least ) but they're still worth look nonetheless . i could continue rambling greatness season two , but you'll really buy dvd set form your own opinions . dvd set come some bonus features , but only one worth season two documentary " turning tide " . rest bonus materials second-rate best	1

culkin(henry ) good job portraying scary lunatic , because he gives off spooky air . his acting , however very dull , takes away movie . however , culkins dry ( but convinving ) performance completely compensated performance elijah wood ( mark ) . not only mark most adorable , loveable child , but his performance jaw-dropping . spotlight this movie really belongs wood . he acts every scene out utmost emotion , passion . he makes this movie one best . it battle good ( mark ) evil ( henry ) . henry plays lunatic son , who awful things his family others . mark comes live henry his family while after his mom dies . henry mark cousin ( too bad mark ) . mark see evil lurking within henry , but he prove it his aunt uncle(henry parents ) before it too late ?	1
this movie complex journey into minds wachowski brothers how they got knowhow put trilogy depth into one single movie . they this movie so multilayered , half movie , talking through other characters since whole movie one idea , it turns out possibly most wholesome movie i've ever seen ! beginning end , its poses many questions lets you create answers within your own mind . everytime i watch this movie , i find something new natalie portman plays part perfect ... puts me tears . it takes couple time watching it it really kick . very well made flick . amaaaaaazing !!!	1
this movie , based thomas harris book , remake movie ' manhunter . ' story leads up events popular silence lambs film . red dragon remade because studio wanted cash surprising popularity hanibal lecter . unfortunately supply thomas harris books exhausted . so they revisited retitled this prequel silence lambs . thomas harris book original manhunter dr. lecter intriguing support character only . but now hollywood discovered hannibal character brings moviergoers so they take every opportunity red dragon add or lenghten scenes dr. lecter put him center stage . original manhunter fine film directed michael mann . it featured brian cox ( bourne identity ) dr. lecter william peterson ( csi ) special agent graham . this movie lacking all aspects original ( book ) . while anthony hopkins portrayal good mr. cox edward norton clearly out his depth . he unable convey complex emotional trauma agent graham experiences when he assimilates mindset sadistic killer who wipes out entire families . performances harvey keitel ralph fiennes also wasted here . my advice-buy or rent original .	-1

i've never particular urge see breakfast tiffany . i'll watch any movie , but there few i don't want spend money such . i found this movie library figured " why not ? " here my review ; movie based novel truman capote ( subject last year " capote " this year " injustice " ) stars audrey hepburn one her most famous roles . anyone who didn't know this , hepburn doesn't play character named tiffany ... tiffany name jewelry store . anyway , hepburn plays holly golightly , eccentric playgirl who lives barren apartment nameless cat uses men way make money . she not golddigger , but whatever she ... it pretty close . holly needs money she middle looking wealthy man marry when less-than-wealthy paul varjak ( george peppard ) , writer , moves next door . two exchange romance candor holly begins calling him fred ( after her brother , who army ) . romance doesn't seem like it going anywhere ; after all , holly looking mr. " rich " right paul ( fred ) poor writer who also seems kind male prostitute one woman who lives 2e . course , this romantic-comedy so you know they're going hook up ... but what happens actually pretty entertaining funny . i suppose most humor comes fact film directed blake edwards ( pink panther fame ) ... majority comedic relief comes mr. yunioshi ( mickey rooney ) , " japanese " manager holly building who frequently remind her keep noise down . mr. yunioshi , course , tanned mickey rooney fake teeth yelling fake accent . he hilarious though , truly great character . character i liked cat , cat . sure it simple character , but i don't know man ... cat cool . hepburn peppard chemistry great , this movie made 1961 but picture perfec t.t his truly gem 60s . if you liked movies like when harry met sally , then you should definitely like this . wonderful movie . grade :	1
" above rim " city game basketball , played asphalt rough , physical style , where rewards status glory neighborhood . it shot location harlem , especially rucker playground , legendary court where , 1970s , visiting stars like wilt chamberlain julius erving would drop play local heroes . movie moves action up present tells story high school basketball whiz named kyle ( duane martin ) who attracted attention top college scouts . georgetown recruiter stands several games . kyle dreams someday playing nba waits anxiously letter intent georgetown , which doesn't come - maybe because , attempt impress scout , he hogging ball taking unwise shots . parallel high school basketball , but world its own , neighborhood shoot-out , tournament held rucker playground teams sponsored local merchants , including drug dealers . kyle plans play team run his school coach . but then his best friend , bugaloo ( marlon wayans ) , talks him into visiting club run sinister birdie ( tupac shakur ) , kid seduced its shabby glamor into agreeing play birdie team . this not wise move . birdie drug dealer , that fact well-known tall , silent shep ( leon ) , former rucker star who moved out town but now back security guard high school . shep once friendly kyle mother ( tonya pinkins ) , now , they begin see each other again , he tries guide kyle direction college , away superficial glories shoot-ou t.t he movie climaxes , course , big shoot-out game , violent surprise i found less than likely . but that not really what it . it more dreams poor black kids use their basketball skills ticket out inner city . this elusive dream , brilliant chicago-based documentary " hoop dreams " demonstrates . only tiny percentage high school stars ever play college , let alone nba . but kids like kyle can't help hoping . both shep his mother point out education , not nba ticket , real reason go school . movie lives easily streets where it shot , performances - especially martin , shakur pinkins - convincing . we get sense daily rhythm character lives , drama , movie finds room surprising amount humor , especially dialogue . movie , directed jeff pollack , co-written pollack barry michael cooper , who wrote poetic evocative wesley snipes drama " sugar hill . " both films cooper strong interest family , how extended support networks fill some gaps left disintegration traditional family unit . here kyle kid lot potential trouble , but also lot good support . my complaint movie plot goes automatic pilot creating character birdie . neighborhood drug dealer such standard cliche now it almost if they plugged him into movie shortcut villain . shakur plays him well , he makes satisfactory bad guy , but subliminal message drugs where money . movie could come up more original choices .	1

this movie one those family charmers something everyone . there exciting animated portion children . there love story ladies . there battle world war ii germans guys all ages . tying all these different aspects together wonderful concept ; angela lansbury mail-order witch ! during world war ii , parents sent their children london country because london bombed continuously . three children , carrie , paul charlie rawlins ( performed cindy o'callaghan , roy snart ian weighill , respectively ) , placed eglantine price ( lansbury ) . we quickly learn miss price completely uninterested caring any children they may upset her mysterious plans . children , we , soon learn miss price witch training , training received mail ! because miss price actually very nice , if somewhat eccentric , lady , she works compromise children , allowing them live her her large home . we also quickly learn mail order school closing , miss price looking important lesson . children miss price off find headmaster school , mr. emelius browne ( played david tomlinson , who also performed " tom jones , " " mary poppins , " " love bug " ) . their mode travel bed miss price modified using spell . mr. browne astounded his spells actually worked . however , mr. browne also sorry but he unable provide important spell miss price seeking ; spell could save england hitler ! soon children , miss price disbelieving mr. browne off portobello road find book containing spell , instead running into bookman ( played sam jaffe , who gunga din 1939 movie " gunga din , " other great movies such " ben-hur " " day earth stood still " ) . after escaping bookman , children adults head off mystical island encounter group animated talking critters . returning island , three children two adults prepared rest searching important spell when they discover german submarine landed soldiers planning create mischief english countryside . ending this movie charmer intrigue even most jaded movie fans , provide laughs everyone . this movie pure escapist fantasy begins very real life event , much like other similar stories such " alice wonderland . " i think angela lansbury makes this movie believable . she slips into her role very comfortably , making you believe she somewhat bumbling witch who barely controls her own spells . she admittedly novice witch , but very believable novice . this movie centers her her acting ability . once you accept miss price apprentice witch , traveling bed , which accompanied dated special effects ) , animated talking animals , armor moving itself easy accept . even easier accept laughs go story . this movie era when disney studios fool-proof formula delivering good family movies . this family movie one best , treasure every family movie library .	1
" goonies " my favorite movie all time . i bite my tongue whenever i watch it anybody because i literally quote movie verbatim . i've considered doing one person stage screen play , but i just can't seem get truffel shuffel move down . hehe ever since i saw this movie kid , it taken ahold my imagination never let go . i lost count how many times i've seen goonies now , but somehow , i never get tired watching film . it still amazes me how this ' 80s movie stood test time ; albeit imagination sheer genius richard donner steven spielberg . you know there 20th anniversary celebration gathering fans all over world back 2005 ? they all met astoria , oregon ; where goonies filmed back 1985 . jeff cohen ( chunk ) sean astin ( mikey/frodo ) even showed up event . correy feldman showed up few days after official event over well . it long rumored sequal goonies works , but unfortunatly , it seems warner brothers killed all hopes not relinquish rights donner speilberg ! talk huge mistake- jerk alert ; seems wb ridden up troy bucket . i could go this movie , but instead i elaborate goonies film subject .. pop soundtrack film score ..... " goonies " pop soundtrack capures fun-loving decade ' 80s listening these songs makes various scenes movie come mind vivid detail . my favorite track off cd probably reo speedwagon " wherever you're goin ' ( it alright ) " . i also quite like philip bailey " love alive " because song played during part movie where troy catapults brand off side cliff little girl , pink , training bike . classic ! who could forget cyndi lauper " goonies ' good enough " track ; not me . i love this song well , it brings back some incredible memories ' 80s this movie specifically . now .. address film score controversy .. there some debate whether or not entire film score ever released united states . many say it simply bootleg got around small circles . ( go soundtrack.com learn more film score . ) said , i know , however , film score recorded ' world premier recording ' cd , " best adventure " . i this cd , goonies score it , quite simply , amazing ! i'm not kidding , when i played it first time , i actually teared up . so nostalgic beautiful . recording this cd almost 19 minutes long ; it recorded city prague philharmonic . this only legitimate cd entire goonies film score ever released ; booklet this cd , " best adventure " also confirms recording ' world premier ' dave grusin goonies film score . there bootlegs circulated goonies film score it ebay . some these pirated cd so called ' previously unreleased ' tracks film . these ebay sellers blatantly lie trick try pass these cd off original ' imports ' japan etc . some people believe anything , so i am here set record straight tell you truth . i even found one ebay seller california gone far changing his user id three times try get away selling slick looking bootleg . this particular pirated cd 2 ' gold ' cd goonies dave grusin film score also so called gold coin prop replica two bumper sticker decals pirated music . i am keeping record what he up . avid official goonies collector , ebay seller also professional graphic designer , i hate see people getting ripped off greedy liars who know photoshop too well who visit knikos too often . i could go exactly how these bootlegs constructed believe me i could whip up exact repliac within day .. yup , even down printed gold discs , ' high quality ' decals , ' unreleased tracks ' , photo booklet gold coin replica . anyways , consider this information buyer beware , word wise , warning . all cd other than best adventure goonies film score pirated . so there no confusion , there legitimate japanese pop soundtrack import , which you see amazon picture above , but there no such thing japanese film score cd or any other film score cd other than " best adventure " . who knows if entire score ever officially released usa well , but , my opinion , found " best adventure " cd even better than finding one eyed willie rich stuff . while i think it , who knows whether warner brothers finally let richard donner steven spielberg make amazing sequal goonies . all stars up it well , but nooo , warner brothers go screw it up ! ( okay , enough stealing mouth lines ) . haha . i really feel , order get film score released officially usa , also order get sequal made ( before everybody starts looking like one eyed willie ) people . people like us who love this movie who dream big . like mikey said , it our time down here ; so start writing , warner brothers , people ; let your voices heard . it our time .. never say die .	1

i seen this movie many times think it very entertaining . brigitte bardot absolutly beautiful , she free sprited bohemian style makes her unlike anyone movies , yet she vulnerable innocent marilyn monroe .. i see how this movie caused uproar 1956 , but it nothing compared movies today . opening scene bb nude sun bathing wouldn't cause any commotion today , fact , some parts really funny watch . plot loosely based marilyn monroe life orphan who forced marry so she doesn't go back orphanage . problem she love two brothers , when she married one . there also older rich man offering her life him . it all leads wild erotic dance bb sexy opened skirt , bare feet , hair flying ..

this one those films makes me think it must impossible anyone make truly great film . back cover makes it sound like must-see anyone going through tough time their lives wanting shoulder lean , it seems all critics concur that not inacurate description , yet when i tried watching this film , i couldn't stand it ! whole thing jumbled mess . it kept going back forth things i just didn't care , tedious , boring things , i think it focused too much criminals involved story , making them sound sympathetic or whatever , when film cop who overcome grief ( supposedly , or something like ) death his partner who viciously killed criminal . story like this shouldn't spend petty time detailing exploits , trials tribulations whatnot why vicious killer kills people whatever else all whatever ... when writer wasn't focusing goodfornothing criminals , it focused bunch pathetic backstory , kind makes teenagers cringe thought reading book ( too much " character development " ) . then i saw truly breathtaking film , titled batman returns ( 1992 ) blown away its depiction heartbreak combined stunning visuals , everyone else like " oh , who cares ? " i truly hate this film i hate society lets people make such mediocre crap then acts like its their civil duty put up it ( watch it ) then say they liked it . no , not all my favorite films action/pop-corn flix . i also liked 1999 bringing out dead , well 1976 taxi driver , i even enjoy occasional " little movie " ( there too many mention , but i'll start last one i saw i enjoyed : wild dogs , director hanging garden - film i hated ) . ok , that all i say this film	-1

this dvd reveals marketing campaign bush administration goal go war iraq . they no reason until 9/11 . but first they convince american people . other words , they lie . first lie : iraq weapons mass destruction ( wmd ) . very broad sense wmd mean chemical nuclear weapons . but chemical weapons tactical or battlefied weapons kill hundreds or even thousands . they also degrade rapidly usually within matter months . then , you see clip g.w. telling his audience saddam several hundred tons chemical agents . there clip condi rice saying aluminum tubes could only beused fuel rockets even though our energy department , un , ambassador wilson claimed they could not . next , there cheney claiming iraq reconstituted nuclear weapons . repeatedly we shown clip after clip bush , cheney , rumsfeld , rice powell claiming iraq wmd capability , claiming they couldn't wait smoking gun come form mushroom cloud . this nuclear side dvd which strategic application , kill millions . when asked if rumsfeld knew definitely where iraq keeping their wmd , he replied , " tikrit baghdad . somewhere north , south , east or west there . " really narrows it down . second lie : there connection al quada saddam hussein . this administration wanted us believe saddam would give traceable nuclear material bin laden so he could use it against us . we supposed believe ultra-control freak , madman virtual pagan would ally himself religious fanatic whom he might share power popularity . sure ! saddam support terrorism , which amounted giving $ 25,000 families suicide bombers israel . there no terrorist training camps under his control . period . third lie : attempting paint anyone who disagreed administration policy traitor . [ ... ] it clear this superb dvd this administration " data mining " i.e. defining their theory then looking any evidence suppport it , rather than other way around . analysts cia who wanted get ahead began write their intelligence estimates suit what they knew administration wanted . analysts who said there no connection ignored . vice president cheney made unprecedented 29 visits cia 9/11 start hostilities . he ever ask , " you certain iraq not involved ? " what would analyst conclude ? why rumsfeld suggest hitting iraq one day after 9/11 ? there no aluminum tubes , yellow cake , wmd , nuclear or chemical . we went war lie alienating our allies , giving our enemies reason . some important questions emerge this dvd : weapons inspector hans blix stated : " how could anyone [ bush administration ] 100% sure existence wmd zero percent knowledge where they ? " now neocons claim these missiles moved syria , but they don't know exactly where . now , how you know sure something one place if you don't know where place ? if israelis knew iraq all these wmd chemical nuclear weapons , wouldn't they bombed them ? would they waited us ? mossad , perhaps finest intelligence service world , spies all over place . they guided israeli bombs iraqi reactor 1981 . anyone believe israelis would sat their hands ? finally , why president bush take us war when he knew :o aluminum tubes not missiles or fuel ? o scud rockets didn't even range get europe ? o ambassador wilson told him iraq not getting enriched uranimum niger ? o letter niger claimed uranium deal made , actually fake ? o weapons inspectors stated iraq no such wmd capability ? o if this president took us war knowing their evidence lie or even suspect , isn't impeachable offense ? richard nixon charged impeachment violating his constitutional oath , failing ensure our laws faithfully executed , making false misleading statements , misuse cia , withholding information congress , deceiving people united states false misleading statements . sound familiar	1

ever since i saw " fahrenheit 9/11 " ( which i thought ferociously hilarious ) , i trying check out michael moore earlier work ( both books films ) . i finally got around see " big one " this weekend . i felt like i could really relate michael disdain corporate america spent time working major corporation myself . i could relate employees various corporations who continually gotten screwed over corporate machine . i think it hilarious how random house tried reign michael shenanigans during his book tour their escorts . while there lots hilarious moments when michael tries confront various company ceos why they laying off their employees when they making good amount cash , there also good mix drama . one my favorite moments film when michael went capital wisconsin talk then governor tommy thompson his welfare reform policies two women who living below poverty level . apparently new welfare reform policy tommy signed when he governor doesn't work everyone . i love politician michael women confront state capital equivalent snake oil salesman , no one buying his schpiel because those women went through process new welfare reform they still living below poverty . one most personal touching moments when michael book signing borders ' bookstore one people line woman who recently laid off ford co .. i moved michael concern woman . i also liked his conversations other people like diners iowa ( i think ) just getting their overall opinions presidential election ' 92 . like his other films , " big one " mixes biting satirical humor real-life drama . michael moore movies me like mtv show " punk'd " socio-political message without talent-challenged ashton kutcher	1

there scene reversal fortune where claus von bulow , surrounded gaggle well-scrubbed harvard law students assisting case , starts reciting few claus von bulow jokes cropped up during trial . " what you call fear dying overdose insulin --- claus - trophobia . " his delivery refined , slow , absolutely flat , no affect . look bemused horror faces students summarizes all contradictions this movie - they simply not understand man they're defending . jeremy irons won oscar this role - he deserved two . his narration acting brideshead revisited almost made casting him claus von bulow inevitability , he seems born this role . he appears so natural screen extraordinary because von bulow such odd , complex , thoroughly detached man . his veneer like lobster shell , exoskeleton ; he smokes cigarette same precision care surgeon would reserve slicing brain tissue . it clear even trial not reveal what makes this man tick , end it doesn't matter , he just so much fun watch . film narrated sunny genius , glen close too seems inherited this part rather than auditioned it . her looks delivery right point ; one wonders how different life coma life inside depression fueled booze pills . alan dershowitz , played admirably ron silver , provides junkyard dog energy fuels picture - everything him stark contrast refined mansions rhode island where even attempted murder must civilized , polite , according form . flawless production values put viewers inside rarified atmosphere , not just wealth , but wealth time age grow soft decadence . few things please us more than when things go horribly wrong super-rich . this film satisfies so many levels .	1

i've seen mike stern group live many times , after first few songs , somehow you get bit bored . this concert kinda same . it got great musicians it , though . great thing mike you tell he plays heart lot intensity . he actually gives 100% when he plays . i've never seen him keyboardist , which probably what lacks . dennis chambers great musician , however , his performance not really audience much it himself drummers . there very little his solos even behind songs average listener appreciate enjoy their level . if you drummer you appreciate what his doing very complex , but get boring average listener . bob franciscini great sound , but his solos get little abstract times but then he stops here comes mike again . richard bona phenominal bass , although he doesn't overplay like other members group it fact makes him shine . he great job tipatina . overall it good performance . i preferred see dave weckl than chambers , myself , but now i just view dvd whenever i wish see mike that good thing	1
this excellent film . billy bob clean-vut barber who keeps himself . his wife married him because she liked he didn't talk very much . it tragedy epic proportions , great performances all involved . only thing me holds this back five star film fact every single scene someone lights up cigarette or taking deep drags one . alone justifies this film " " rating . when watching this film , it seems they encouraging people " cool " smoking pleasurable thing . most notorious moment me when frances mcdormand sitting bathtub asks her barber husband ( billy bob ) shave her legs . he walks somberly cigarette drooping his lips she tells him give her drag . this putrid moment just drove me crazy ! but then , just my opinion . overall , film could good greater if it not incessant smoking throughout . plot slow yet intensely emotional . if you don't mind smoking , then you probably enjoy this dramatic tragedy . if you strongly opposed smoking or children who interested seeing this , you should review film before letting them see it	1
i already fan welles " touch evil " when i came across this gem 3 am one night public tv . variety reasons , i keep volume off , but nonetheless i spellbound couldn't wait hear dialogue plot ! set little expensive casual viewer , but film so entertaining if you catch it sale or used i heartily recommend shelling out it . it fast moving , quirky little film noir some amusing dialogue ( my favorites include " criminals aren't worst people - they're just stupidest ! " " they're penitentes - it means they're sorry their sins " - " they must awful sorry ... " ) . whatever reasons history personality there , welles films simply over-critiqued . this enjoyable any 40 bogart caper flick accident history left it sadly ignored - so " thank you ! " criterion finally giving this marvelous film it day sun . i pleased opportunity see other ' versions ' film , but snappiest version still " confidential report " - warts , continuity gaffs all . it somehow comes across very humorous - something i felt new edit lacking . that odd because footage mainly same . perhaps it pace dolivet version maintains . one thing criterions bw transfers i bone pic though , shadows simply too dark . my home vision vhs copy seems easier eye little details within shadows apparent , where criterion transfer they solid black . i same trouble watching " seven samurai " i'll keeping my vhs , too . ah , well . overall i'm thrilled hope they release " trial " someday .	1
great plot ! crooked president who only thinks himself his needs ; good hearted man named dave who thinks others , only thing they common their outward appearance . dave called upon sit president his job while . two presidents regular staff try get dave things contrary dave character . so story goes there . who win battle crooked verses good white house . this dvd picture good clear , sound great , case excellent condition . if you like warm hearted type movies , then this one you . i know i enjoyed it over over . me , dave character , good or bad , choices we make life affect others around us .	1
this quite simply best book film adaption ever accomplished hollywood . ever . i am author myself , part what inspired me narnia . my heart always tied this land created cs lewis . it pure magic , this man phenomenal writer his story original fantasy . first , let me tell you my usual reviews book movie translations . i absolutely detested lord rings trilogy . i know it sounds harsh , but i hated those movies . peter jackson , though great director his own right , absolutely butchered tolkiens world . me , those movies if he took book , rammed it into shotgun , fired , picked up scattered remains , glued mismatched pieces together handed it actors . thats how bad i think they . if books never , those movies would great stand alone movies , but they aren't , because they removed many better sections tolkiens tale . harry potter . i loved first few books , i got really pissed off movie when it came out because once again , they cut out many better scenes book . i stopped watching movies after second one . so , you probably expect , when i walked into movie theater december , waiting see chronicles narnia : lion , witch , wardrobe , i very antsy , very skeptical . narinia closer me my heart than any other novels hollywood ruined , so i expecting worst , same time , dreadfully depressed what " worst " could mean . i walked , i took my seat , film started . beggining " blitz " scene began , i immediatly noticed how close reality planes bombing manuevers . ( historian heart , thats brownie point right there ) then i realised importance this first scene . director putting viewer into middle lewis time . showing you what surroundings he writing this . right then , i started hope . movie unfolded , children got train , first opening strain true " narnia " music began play , i began cry . no joke . i sat cried first few minutes i heard music . because i knew right then there , narnia stepped out cs lewis mind , out his book , onto this screen . this director managed bind very essence narnia into this movie . there differences . it true , changes made . but they small , they few , they far . whatever it director this movie , it bound spirit book into this film . i cannot tell you how happy i when i left movie theater . there no words describe it , coming writer , who describes things living , thats pretty damn hard come . this film magical . everything , all casting , all sets , all lines , if they personally overseen c.s. lewis himself . when you watch this film , you there . you stepped through walked into narnia . so , if there any doubt your mind buying or watching this movie i hope i cleared it up , because i tell you if you shell out whatever cash buy this , you very , very glad you . best thing movie like this , gather your family close you , sit catch lights off , christmas eve , watch this . welcome narnia folks , i never thought we'd make it , but guess what ? aslan worked miracle just you me	1
i not enjoy this movie very much . after reading what this movie , i really high hopes it . i expected it very interesting moving . but after watching it , i somewhat disappointed . one flaws this movie it focuses too heavily friendship main character little girl ( main child character ) . she becomes obsessed him develops crush him . she gets jealous possessive when he tries help or others , whether they children or adults . i certainly not like part where man innocent child take her place transport death camp . addition , i strongly suspect her voice dubbed woman voice . it not sound like little girl voice all . this movie flaws play end movie , where main character children try show red cross what really happening jews europe , , my opinion , not very well . children pushed into space supposed represent gas chamber , then they quickly pulled out . main character , knowing he children going killed anyway , should concluded play children lie down pretend quot ; sleep . quot ; this would sent less ambiguous message red cross . overall , despite these weaknesses ( several others ) , i found movie passable , am not discouraging anyone watching it . however , i certainly not add it my collection holocaust movies . some holocaust movies i feel much better , would strongly recommend , include schindler list , sophie choice , europa , europa , escape sobibor , good evening mr. wallenberg , life beautiful , triumph spirit ( latter two movies among best movies i ever seen )	-1
only problem this dvd there isn't enough info original investigation . this truly fascinating watch , very sad commentary state mind middle america even nowadays . these children screwed over so obviously our " justice " system sad really burns heart anyone who believes justice . most fascinating character still crazy step-father who totally " sketchy " really appears much more capable murder than docile children who convicted . i haven't seen first film would love know more just how these kids railroaded . they alibi , what argued motive etc ., etc . these details would nice addition this film just so everyone more familiar background , however , this still very interesting flick . very sad	1

" four brothers " yet nail coffin john singleton increasingly moribund moviemaking career . director - who burst upon scene 1991 vibrant gritty " boyz hood " - here mounted film so burdened implausibility contrivance it makes one wonder if once-promising filmmaker ever able get back track again . story , reeking artificiality , features mark wahlberg , tyrese gibson , andre benjamin garrett hedlund four troubled young men raised same foster mother . when she killed convenience store robbery , quartet launches into action , seeking revenge against perpetrators becoming slowly convinced , through their investigation neighborhood , killing might not random nature they initially led believe . main weakness this film it gives us virtually no reason care any characters . not showing us any scenes boys their foster mother ( except one embarrassingly bad thanksgiving dinner fantasy sequence looks if it conceived first-year film student ) , we forced take their relationship totally faith , rendering boys ' thirst revenge arbitrary worst academic bes t.t he acting uniformly flat , characters little more than wafer-thin stereotypes , even action scenes come across surprisingly mundane second-rate given singleton pedigree this area . boys ' running around venue venue their detroit neighborhood , brandishing guns full view populace screaming information their mother killer , ludicrous face it often reduces film level cheap low comedy burlesque . nary single moment rings believable or true , " four brothers " by-the-book filmmaking director who proven he wherewithal talent so much more .	-1

" i really wasn't prepared how deeply funny , sad , brilliant this little film . let get past problems first : bad lighting , amateurish camera angles , okay , yes . but story wayward reject april ( katie holmes , who so brilliant perfect i can't understand what happened her career -- oh right ; tom ; oops ! ) her desperate attempt prepare thanksgiving dinner her estranged family , most hellish apartment building nyc , superb . some lines come out nowhere just force you laugh , they so funny true . patricia clarkson mother cancer oliver platt her loving , keep-positive-at-all-times husband , just simply outstanding . movie keeps moving all times its funny-tragic plot , its sad little subplot boyfriend bobby ( derek luke ) trying find nice suit impress april family , just takes hold you drags you this dysfunctional family world insists you go ride , whether you like it or not . sean hayes not big part i thought he , but indicated without shadow doubt his off-kilter comic timing cinched him part jack " grace . " only thing questionable why world would he living this delapidated hell-hole his purebreed dog his spanking new oven ? other residents , including nutcase vegan , staggeringly funny lillias white woman who first lets april into her apartment use her oven ( few hours ) , entire chinese family who patiently listen april valiant attempt explain history united states -- all it just outstanding . i loved it , loved it , loved it . ( i say i loved it ? )yes , you get over atrocious lighting ( hello people -- ever hear lights ? ) , if you claustrophobia you might freak out feeling tight , crammed little apartments , but if you get past those things you enjoy ou t-t here humor tinge tragedy , you're treat . thumbs up all way	1

i understand low budget ... stuff like happens , but voices didnt match . mothers voice didnt seem real all . it sounded like it child . no way would older woman voice sounds like . i like it how devon character understand his new emerging feelings , realize he not only one feels way . it nice know his soon ex-girlfriend understanding type . she even involved end when it comes uncovering truth devon step-dad . that true friend . i felt so bad seeing brian such bad shape when devon rescued him after he beaten up . i gonna cry . he said he raped that just one topic always gets me . my heart just goes out victim . i'm glad earlier movie he becomes willing share his feelings more devon , actually calls him back after they get into their first fight . brian cried once he hung up phone always shows more sensitive part man that such turn me . good movie ... i've seen better when it comes acting , but it still good . i'm glad i bought it , but would've liked seen more devon brian relationship . oh well . good job .	-1

frank mccourt best-selling book so good , this movie so true it , if you liked one , you'll like this because rarely film so close book . it amazing , given what normally case . even though film brought no surprises , i still thought it fascinating because fantastic cinematography here great job actors . muted colors this film beautiful lighting superb . then again , it hard go wrong nighttime streetlight-lit shot cobblestone streets . directing talents alan parker never more evident than here . he should more movies . book , " angela ashes , " biography mccourt his extremely poor irish family . all three boys who play mccourt various times his development excellent here . whole cast excellent , matter , led " angela " ( emily watson ) husband malachy ( robert caryle ) . two sadder-looking faces , you never see , more rainy , dreary town ( limerick ) you never see .... so if you're looking happy , uplifting story , pass this one . however , if you want film totally true great book , wonderfully photographed film one acted well .... some unique humor it , check this out . i don't want leave out humor , key ingredient mccourt otherwise- depressing days growing up . humor dire poverty never went together so well mccourt made it sound through his book filmmakers through this movie .	1
three problems this film : 1 . pacing - film pacing doesn't vary . it very boring . matter fact , this wouldn't problem if film much more tense ( e.g. , " speed " ) , however this film lacks high-action intensity pull off such slow expository speed . 2 . effects - too many sequences this film rely color light superimpositions , there overabundance high-speed imaging . scene changes employ erratic barrages images desensitize viewer thrilling " horror " scenes . furthermore , they fail make enough sequential sense film plot really mean much film greater whole . upshot : film relies too heavily art editing , point where plot twists no longer interesting . 3 . triviality - plot conclusion quails face " so what ? " question . viewer left sense , " i sat through film ? " light points ( 1 ) ( 2 ) , this obnoxious bit icing cake . don't waste your life . alon	-1
violent anyone ! this movie horrible . cast good , but plot stinks ! its just this family who super powers . then this kid wanted mr. incredibles side kick . ( way) mr. incredible says no so then he hates him . then kid turns evil kills people , wants every body like him . thats origanal . there barely any jokes you laugh once every 20 minutes , there way much violence . killing , guns , punching , bombs , they say stupid words sometimes . i not like person who directed this film because he should not like violence . so i not recommend this movie anyone . especially 2 disc special edition !	-1

fast furious tokyo drift 17 year old kid named sean played lucas black . sean loves cars he loves race them but it too bad he can't get away police like brian o'conner ( paul walker ) because he already caught twice his way third strike . sean ends up wrecking his car race against high school jock who racing keep his girlfriend . sean gets caught instead going jail he goes tokyo live his father . what you here tokyo drift new beginning fast furious series . vin diesel no oscar winning actor but he made fast furious good , you can't lie say it doesn't need him . since diesel won't come back even help paul walker can't give film what it needs why not change everything but still keep idea fast furious . film seems trying start something new just like original film first its kind . only material i've able view japanese drifting anime initial this film . both show different views style people who drift japan . one similar thing everybody cocky sure their skills everyone lives breathes drifting . i tell truth because i truly think this film up there first one , i'm not saying it better but this nicely original story just like first film . although cast may sound weak i little faith lucas black little faith bow wow . bow wow actually talented actor nice job supporting lucas . one thing i hated writers just add hot girl middle two guys . she choose guy she supposed love because his family saved her life new guy she supposed hate because he american . you think people would get tired stuff now , when someone surprise me something different . first fast furious it brian chasing toretto sister , second brian chasing monica ( eva mendes ) , now you sean who chasing neela . i plenty positive things say this film . i really liked this story even though it getting too close one those teen movies . i love drifting way it filmed ; i doubts whole drifting idea . i thought drifting would fun but boring watch i wrong because it hot . slowed down scenes show just how close these cars come hitting wall spinning out control amazing . what i loved most this third film there perfect blend action throughout film . there not too much talking not enough action or too much action not enough story . city beautiful , lots lights , cool buildings , plenty color . characters all written well actually deep stories . there not much nos used not much speed first two movies but this movie still very exciting . i don't think i stress enough how great drifting how beautiful cars . fast furious tokyo drift entertaining hopefully there more series like this one	1

i'm dance teacher , so occasionally i buy dvd get new ideas inspiration . this one total waste time . when i fast-forwarded through scenes dancers showing off there only 20 minutes actual instruction . it not hiphop ! dancers training , moves like pivot turns kick-ball-changes ( standard jazz dance fare ) , disguised called something else . there no pop or lock moves , dance ' routines ' monotonous . good real hiphop dancing dvd scenes ' instruction ' where dancers showcased their talents - but they never break these down or give any explanations them . dancers good , instruction isn't . it completing misleading call it hiphop . it jazz twist funky style .	-1
john huston film version tennessee william play night iguana talky complex affair . i can't say it my favourite collection william films currently released dvd - it lacks final cataclysmic denouement typical his other works such suddenly last summer roman spring mrs. stone . but film always psychologically compelling it most notable terrific performance richard burton rev . shannon , desperate , alcoholic recently defrocked minister who resorted working tour guide , busing groups old ladies across mexico . shannon constantly trying resist temptation , especially advances buxom young blonde charlotte goodall ( sue lyon ) . eventually , he lured into uncompromising position discovered group leader charlotte overprotective chaperone grayson hall , ( judith fellowes ) who acts get burton fired sexual misbehavior . effort head off her inquisition him , shannon leads group rundown hotel perched high cliff west mexico owned raucous widow maxine faulk ( ava gardner ) . he tries outwit grayson , stay away charlotte , enlisting help maxine , his like-minded partner crime . almost once hannah jelkes ( deborah kerr ) , new england spinster arrives her 97-year-old grandfather , spreading gentility oozing sense cultivation virtue second-rate poetry old man writes . she attracted burton despite their opposites , she somewhat envious his freewheeling boozy ways , while he admires her stoic no-nonsense resilience towards life . stage set attraction clash opposites , each character confessing even unleashing their inner demons . grayson probably attracted young charlotte , but because this 1964 , her same sex attraction only hinted . maxine loose tarty -she even couple hunky mexican boys call - she doesn't take kindly grayson puritanical moralizing or hannah fussy superior ways . sexually repressed hannah contrasted charlotte aggressive sexual appetite besotted , drunk shannon , it all comes across absolute plethora sexual tension . film loaded symbolism - captured iguana , dark , stormy night , shannon tirade he walks around broken glass . most action consists talking hotel terrace through sticky tropical night love , sex meaning life . acting solid , burton giving most compelling performance . he figure wild chaos , damaged sufferer without shred real genuineness . ms. kerr quite spectacular spinsterish hannah many ways quite sad her restrained beauty . dear ava - perhaps weakest trio - appropriately tough raucous . she sweeps around premises , yelling clattering guests , raising eyebrows she flirts her luscious mexican beach boys . film end all characters seem atoned sins world , or least found something within each other enables them achieve type happiness . typical fashion , film packed many ideas they introduced such loud , strident boozy way , it impossible not continue admire literary genius tennessee williams . mike leonard may 06 .	1

this dvd really good selection gang/ rascals comedies , among best bunch ! " free wheeling " ( 1932 ) much said supposed racism gang/rascals , but this possibly most anti-racist all gang films . dickie moore snooty mother overprotects her impaired son refuses let him play stymie , who she referrs " colored boy " " street urchin , " but guess who saves day ? strong stuff 1932 good stuff today . mike fright ( 1934 ) hoot gang " international silver string submarine band " running amuck radio station . love gag where tommy bond sucks lemon ( " they're good your freckles " ) while leonard tries play trumpet .

i really looking forward movie . my goal expand my understanding this historical period . many scenes looked like they used old sets 50 westerns lighting technique disappointing , these alone not turn me off watching . my real gripe movie dialogue acting . within first 10 minutes movie , stage coach robbed , my attention drawn portrayals actors . they not believable dialogue just sounded like something came out book young readers . later , when alerted posse nearly upon them , other rider responds such uncharacterist language male ruffian i laughed . movie plodded forward , scene after scene left me wondering , how quickly this thrown together how come they didn't rehearse more . i felt my patience endure several more hours unfair punishment . i generally try watch movie entirely but frankly , i think it embarrassment waste time . maybe it got better ( why i gave it two stars ) but i find doubtful . i am wondering if both tom berrenger other author missed many classes script writing 101 .	-1
this truly one finest films ever made exposing tyranny cuban communist state over one its weakest subjects . irony film , effeminate homosexual poet , actually bravest , strongest most heroic man film . only " real man " reinaldo arenas . while latin ' macho ' heterosexual males actually cowardly accomplices no honor , guts or bravery . reinaldo patriot , real man who not lack courage his conviction . this film make you rethink concept manhood , our homosexual hero stood firm against castro dictatorship , continued his conviction world literature which dominated pro castro left ... thus guaranteeing his works would never published . unashamed his sexuality , he faced death same conviction he faced injustice while living castro communist cuba . see this film . one caveat , i suggest you buy dvd see film english subtitles . poetry dialogue make experience something you'll never forget . imagery film , outstanding , musical score perfect . scene johnny depp both transvestite gestapo like communist interrogator my opinion one his finest performances . especially memorable , lezama lima explaining our hero since tyrant cannot govern beauty , he wants destroy it , allowing 400 years cuban culture go down drain while everyone applauds . there so many universal truths this film one simple review cannot possibly elaborate 1/10 them . however i guarantee you never forget this film . just remember use english subtitles it stay you rest your life	1

2005 " upside anger , " missed out during awards season ; it didn't well boxoffice . but don't pass it . it features chilling performance joan allen boozy abandoned stay-at-home wife ( her husband apparently left sweden his assistant ) , great comeback performance kevin costner her neighbor , who plays beer-buzzed ex-baseball player turned radio dj ( he hired talk baseball but he doesn't want ) . scene where costner first learns allen husband abandoned her hoot . he arrives her door , beercan hand , discuss idea turning those tulgy woods behind their property into subdevelopment , things progress bizarrely there , ill-matched pair end up making each other comfortable , finally they're least embarked road happiness . supporting cast great , too . allen four daughters , superbly played ( oldest youngest ) alicia witt , keri russell ( " felicity " ) , erika christiansen ( " traffic " ) , evan rachel wood ( " pretty persuasion " ) . each memorable scene or two or three . director mike binder turns up kostner not quite pervy producer . he overdoes sleazebag bit , but maybe that point . beware ! film begins ( ends ) one those pseudo-significant voiceover narrations ( wood ) funeral scene ( rain , course ) . might make you roll back your eyes hit eject button . but don't it ! there quick flashback three years before , when action starts , you begin realize you haven't seen all characters you're now introduced among mourners . so , various crises develop way , you begin ponder who among others buried . when you find out , it quite shock .	1

i all prepared rate " hard boiled " slightly above average hong kong shoot-em-up entertaining but nothing would distinguish it similar fare . then director john woo serves up inspired finale hospital rank one most ingenious action segments screen history . set-up some gangsters stashed arsenal hospital morgue . police uncovered operation which leads stand-off them hoods . caught hospital staff , patients , some oh-so-cute newborn babies . less said better . nevertheless , woo throws out rulebook what action film . woo essentially toying us first hour or so order throw us this delicious curveball . i imagine some people revulsed this segment . personally , i awestruck grateful artist like woo taking risk	1
i forever dark why anyone would dislike this piece theater . so many times you hear how " cerebral " " inaccesible " sondheim shows . it so hard people think feel same time ? beauty this piece it forces audience think their relationship art ( either artist or patron ) same time allows you care characters deeply . alright , so you listen it few times before you really begin " get it . " this work allows you witness artist ( considered genius many ) who devotes himself competely his work only realize he must it expense all his other relationships . " beautiful , " during which george tries but realizes it too late connect his aging mother , " we not belong together , " when love his life tells him she simply cannot #2 anymore , i am not sure how anyone watch these amazing moments not moved . score haunting acting ( except few moments don't quite work mr. patinkin ) astonishing . it very risky choice opening number during which soloist hardly moves , but bernadette peters draws you start ... brilliant acting . perhaps voices not " perfect " dvd they original soundtrack , but give me actors who willing sacrifice perfect vocal delivery emotional content any day . this production one my favorites essential anyone interested artistic process	1

okay , let get one thing straight , acting pretty good . all kids cute adorable pretty darn good job their parts . vin diesel good lovely watch , lauren graham movie ! ( think : lorelai gilmore ) . though , lauren looked different some reason , i couldn't quite place it ; added pounds ? new hair style ? i don't know ... anyway onto storyline , or lack there . put it simply , it appears object write movie vin diesel it , style kindergarten cop . however , someone failed hire good writer , or director ! they rushed through intro cut through blah-blah ( substance ) story just so they could arrive part where they could " showcase " vin diesel this role tough guy caring some adorable kids . it not convincing ; so many scenes just happen they leave you feeling like you whiplash . all all , it probably great movie kids 8 , 9 , 10 years old .	-1

" dream , silly dreamer " tells story walt disney company dismantling its historic animation department , very foundation which company built . it still seems incomprehensible . world loves classic disney animation . this great american art form speaks child within each us . behind each classic disney film artists who created them . this their poignant story . everyone who loves animated films must see this film , which documents destruction disney animation studio its legacy which spans seven decades . i'll admit it - i am far casual viewer . i am passionate student classic disney style animation . i am awe technique required real , full-blown animation . but much i respect technique , i am moved investment artists ' hearts medium . it power drawings come life , animation ability move us , i find so compelling . preface , let me tell you " dream , silly dreamer .

this product limited no longer made universal studios . steven spielberg prefers you buy his new " enhanced " version e.t.i , like most reviewers here , prefer original version this movie . what spielberg 2002 this movie he computer-animated e.t. , enhanced few scenery shots , added two extra scenes , digitally removed all hand guns . now i don't mind him adding extra scenes , but all other things basically changed film . i liked e.t. puppet . he more real . speilberg basically just threw away all work puppeteers ( which made up little people , boy no legs , lady doing . . ' arms ) . yes spielberg , i understand this what you would if given technology back 1982 , but you don't change anything . digitally removing handguns replacing them walkie-talkies stupid too . government agents use guns stop anyone who tries stop them . spielberg philosophy behind doing this he regretted government agents using guns apprehend kids . but that what agents . how they going stop kids walkie-talkies , say , " hey , i walkie-talkie i'm not afraid use it . " spielberg also upset guns family film . well , he didn't really make this " family film " when he allowed cussing it , such " " word , " " word , somebody calling someone else " pen*s breath . " how come you didn't edit spielberg . so if you , try buy this product , because this only way find this film its original version ( unfortunately this product 2002 version but it all worth it ) . every director should freedom what they want films , but keep original versions fans please ! goes you too george lucas .	1
it amazing how hollywood publishing industry bent their knees secession mythology , birth nation present example melodramatic falsification . this very dull , shapeless , stilted movie . i wouldn't bother denounce it artistic grounds , but since it above all piece propaganda , i'm compelled condemn it history . what it presents " war states " version civil war , which gallant southerners defend their homes , their beloved hills dales , their cultured lives inexplicable invasion rude hordes north . there only two black characters , both sentimentally loyal their southernness their masters ; otherwise , slavery beside point . generalship lee jackson , course , idolized , while northern officers above rank colonel portrayed fools . battle scenes perfectly predictable ; guys charge foot , other guys shoot , fields littered bodies . wouldn't little exposition logistics those battle more interesting ? how real it show only one train , southern , war won more transportation than musketry ? if you believer myth lost cause justice secession , if you ever cottoned notion war wasn't really slavery , then i challenge you honor ! i defy you read just one heavy , scholarly book , arguing slavery william lee miller , professor university virginia . it retells debates occurred house representatives , over slavery , 1830s , twenty-five years before election lincoln . uncompromising sectional hatred expressed those debates surely convince you civil war deeper roots than you thought , slavery indeed central issue both sides , blue grey	-1

dead end classic , but one that pretty much forgotten these days rarely revived tv , let reissue circuit . it shame , because alongside crusading social drama it also one most strikingly designed magnificently shot films thirties thanks greg toland remarkable photography richard day marvellous set . almost every shot film extraordinarily imaginative - not just beautifully composed , but also absolutely right scene . william wyler hands , it still works pretty well drama despite plethora stereotypes . joel mcrea , most unjustly forgotten star 30s , makes best worst them idealistic but starving would-be architect , dead end kids when they still kids hadn't changed their screen names half dozen times display early signs all irritating shtick would turn them into one most painful ensembles 40s , but sylvia sidney striking worker , claire trevor hooker ( no typecasting there ) bogart disillusioned gangster make most their opportunities . but marjorie main bogie mom ? that hard sell best days ! bogart dead end kids would cross street warners lot co-star angels dirty faces couple years later , but this one beats even cagney classic . sadly no extras , but dvd transfer quite superb . highly recommended .	1

would " caligula " or " nero " shocked what their city , eternal city , become so many years into distant future ? or would they ( probably more likely ) find themselves fitting right somehow ? this one notions i found myself pondering i watched this movie . it really great movie , it certainly worth any true film fan time . i may even liked ( some it least ) better than ( again , some ) la dolce vita . grown up italian family - my father born " pagliarone " ( roughly , slang dialect term meaning " stone hut " ) ancient very rural village molise - i myself definitely right home , so speak , watching scenes like famous " dinner piazza " . ( personally i could watch scene again again not get tired it , but ... maybe it " italian thing " , so speak , others would not find it so amusing ) . however there certainly no dearth general humour found antics wild cast characters which fellini always brings into his films . roma course no exception this . example bedridden obese old woman hairnet , who owns building he stays rome when he first arrives rome , who tells him , " now let just live peace not bust each other balls " ! or bald old man who rather convincing mussolini impersonation . my personal favorite though would probably ultra-tanned " continental " type guy who approaches female american tourist second she gets off bus , telling her , " you very bella " offering take her picture her . or young man piazza scene ( which supposed taken place some thirty years prior ) who wearing gold medallion one those black nylon " do-rags " ( kind rap stars wear today ) , yelling up his dark beautiful brooding girlfriend get down piazza before he throws her off balcony . sure these walking stereotypes , these characters , negative ones . but , they say , there kernel truth ( least ) all stereotypes there not ? instance entire " dinner piazza " scene , any italian or italian-american must admit , definitely resemble some sort " prototypical " pre-emigration summer-night-in-bensonhurst or some place like , plenty gold chains , " dago-t " , " pane vino " go around . more serious note however most touching scene ( this point usually generally agreed upon i think most movie fans ) scene sudden ( apparently accidental ) destruction ancient roman frescoes modern work-crew . obviously this fellini artistic condemnation , if you , massive industrialization city modern times , ( clearly potentially disastrous ) effects what we may call " godless modern " encountering ancient sacred . cruel loud machinery encountering long-buried , " resting-in-peace " , " sacred " . such imagery , like fellini vision vanishing ancient frescoes , so evocative it truly make viewer want weep . athough rome improved much since fellini filmed it back 1972 , this film , during both time periods he shows it us , city appears delusional . vaguely delirious fever perhaps . or throes long restless night full tossings-and-turnings wild " half-waking " dreams . it these dreams fact constitute " images " " vignettes " fellini shows us throughout film .	1
[ ... ] this film deeply moving my perspective because it so well produced . subtleties nuances what truly distinguished film . thus , instance , very low current homosexuality which undergirds two main characters always present , always acting , but doing so behind scenes , way keeps viewer unsure exactly where deeper feelings stand two men . nuance love-hate relationship our two protagonists share one . they example classic case " can't live him--can't live without him " . [ ... ] essence , what i found so truly impressive film its realness , realness disguised under character persona . joe ratso not truly cared any other male until they met one rely one . ending film quite tender , depicting how caring gentle loving joe nurturing ratso during his debilitating illness their bus trip florida . film indicates transformation , expansion , growth both characters , they come realize their lives much more than parochial narrow self interests . this film won several academy awards ( 1969 ) , my opinion , deserves its classic moniker . both hoffman voight turned excellent dynamic exceptionally convincing performances , i would say this film showed them their best acting potential . i added this one my small collection expect enjoy it years .	1
last reviewer said it all . this great concert , great deep purple era . but they ruined this disc . transfer horribly poor , looks like it bad videotape transferred pal ntsc , not professionally , so it jumpy quality . i very excited get this new disc i one brazilian boots it years . while this disc some interesting extras , dual layered dvd-9 , missing song , it all wasted horrible video transfer job they . it looks like vcd it so bad . band should embarrassed unauthorized overseas versions this show look much better than this . i'll probably never watch this disc again brazilian version i bought ebay years ago looks much better . there got much better master this show than this . let hope they pull this coaster remaster it right way . i just don't understand it . my advice go ebay get one those overseas boots this disc because they much better quality than this piece junk	-1

first time i saw casablanca , i didn't understand why everyone loved it . i tend look relationship aspect films , my eyes , romance rick ( humphrey bogart ) ilsa ( ingrid bergman ) lacking . set , no one knew whether ilsa supposed truly love rick or not which caused bergman play part ambiguously . however , i finally realized relationship strong because rick love ilsa . it didn't depend mutual affection all . this revelation , i able see film what it : masterpiece . rick own rick cafe , seedy bar casablanca during wwii . casablanca still free nazi control , though nazi leaders swarm streets . this makes it place filled refugees hoping escape america . these refugees leader against nazi , victor laszlo ( paul henreid ) . he brings his wife rick , beautiful ilsa . it throws rick into tailspin ; two lot history he brooding over her since she left him . there , he begins act rather uncharacteristically . no one deny cleverness script ; afi recognized many lines it 100 years 100 quotes ... list . also recognized afi list theme song " time goes .

`brian song ' , true story brian piccolo his fight against cancer , one most critically acclaimed `made tv ' movies ever released . this due mostly heroic story acting chops mr. james caan . film , chronicling relationship two football players chicago bears , one white one black , showcases these two men they bond over course time . brian ( caan ) helps his teammate gale sayers ( billy dee williams ) when he injured during game need physical therapy heal his knee . likewise , when brian diagnosed malignant cancer gale there his bedside giving him emotional support , helping him put up his fight against his latest opponent . brian fight lost , but his story lives . film based novel `i am third ' taken fact brian always second ( or even third ) choice team , always one best , but never `the ' best due players like sayers . acting this film bit lacking , although caan giving yet terrific performance , shelly fabares fine job julie , brian loving wife , but williams performance shy reserved sayers bit forced , his breakdown locker upon hearing brian condition completely unbelievable . caan acting legend , releasing this just before his brilliant turn `the godfather ' sure get him noticed . this film remade before , story not changed , but it caan brian i'll always remember .	1

400 blows francois truffaut first feature film , 47 years later , it remains ( my opinion ) his best most famous film . it not hard understand why . movie not perfect , it doesn't visualistic stylishness jules jim . but every line , every shot , every moment movie seems come straight truffaut heart . film semi-autobiographical -- like antoine , truffaut lonely juvenile delinquent . truffaut would make series films chronicling anti-hero antoine donel ( jean-pierre laud ) , but none those films matches overwhelming impact 400 blows . story simple enough -- antoine , dreamy , sad boy , neglected his self-centered parents , gets trouble school , engages some petty theft ( typewriter , specific ) . his parents think him burdensome trouble , so he sent away juvenile deliquent school . not much storyline , it ? well , that genius 400 blows . i've yet see film recreates teenager life such keen eye sensitivity . truffaut uses deceptively simple devices " follow " antoine his sad journey . one such example antoine interview psychologist deliquent school . it filmed one long take , camera focuses squarely antoine . psychiatrist/counselor never seen , so antoine speaks straight camera , i felt like he speaking straight me . antoine answers questions mix insight , sensitivity , naivete , incoherence . antoine talks everything his sexual impulses his relationship his parents . one point , he says , " oh , i lie now then , i suppose . sometimes i'd tell them truth they still wouldn't believe me , so i prefer lie . " example day outing students antoine school . truffaut uses overhead shot follow students they skip prance their way around streets paris . beginning , children all one line . but slowly , kids begin diverge different directions . it could hokey , but scene unforgettably charming . , course , final " frozen shot " become one most famous film history . again , simple device , produces huge emotional impac t.t ruffaut responsible much film success , but huge part film performance jean-pierre laud . his dark , sad eyes , he reminded me little sal mineo rebel without cause . many children tend " overact " attempt appear serious , but laud performance so understated pitch perfect end movie i thought antoine friend , someone i wanted protect . antoine mother ( claude maurier ) also perfect . she not horrible , abusive mother , but her self-absorbed insensitivity becomes painful watch . i love way she rushes around crowded paris apartment , if she didn't patience sit down even second . when she coldly disowns antoine during visit juvenile deliquent school , it absolutely chilling . criterion collection dvd commentary track robert lechaney , who portrayed antoine friend rene film . there also interviews truffaut laud . highly recommended .	1

movie head takes look trappings closeted gay son ari ( alex dimitriades ) traditional greek orthodox upbringing . director ana kokkinos tries flush surface isolation alienation one man feels his family alternate lifestyle they would never apporve . within this script , ari enters into realms drugs unprotected sex then comes realization this how his life must end up . alex dimitriades his credit helps this movie tremendously , his dark good looks , brooding nature , tortured portrayal man torn secret life . however , this actor cannot carry movie alone other characters movie not come through vividly . director wants make point how various ethnic beliefs impacts hardships some who want come out but afriad too , yet avoiding confration must take place parent offspring viewer injustice because full message not delievered . director should concentrate more family life interactions giving greater sense anguish , instead ridiculous clubs parties . movie continues its downward spiral , it comes abrupt end no real realistic resolution comes head , thus viewer left seeing gay movie where it easier let audience draw conclusions than movie itself diving deeper than surface drugs , sex denial	-1

we purchased this visual gospel well over 10 years ago when there wasn't dvd available price $80-$100 . we've given copies this video many people gifts simply because we think it best depiction real , human jesus he would . bruce marchiano portrays character beautifully range emotions he shows he pulls viewer amazing . whenever i watch his portrayal jesus garden gethsemane rest events after , it drives home point this jesus who laughed totally human also felt all pain despair he endured . he it willingly ? i think there times doubt despair but character shows believable glimpses doubt supported incredible faith . i'm shocked some bad reviews listed . fact , i wish i could give this video 10 stars . without doubt this most inspiring video i ever seen my life . i hope pray it never goes out print i wish more people would open up their minds jesus who real , who smiles , who gets hungry dirty , person who feelings just like us . after all he fully god fully man . jesus this video not smokin ' anything one poor reviewer indicated . quite contrary . it sad know people close minded judgmental cannot open their minds viewing such believable human portrayal miracle man who walked earth . i'm completely amazed feel unbelievably blessed we watch video this interesting , mesmerizing , engrossing " word word " bible . i think directors producers this video inspired vision create artistic piece masterful showing time period , how word written passed down generation generation , gives viewer much more accurate realistic time-frame how jesus taught disciples everything he . this best money you'll ever spend .	1

i must begin saying i am not fan shirley maclaine early work . her speaking voice shrill , i think raves mainly her body . so it worth noting i love " what way go . " when actress big name longevity , there one movie you point say , " watch this movie , you know why she star . " i feel this movie movie miss maclaine . she sings , she dances - move move gene kelly - she carries this movie entirely her frequently bare back . she throws herself 100% into every ridiculous costume change situation , always self possessed , but not self concious . here , her body certainly made use , take-off french art films equally silly , sexy , laughable ... but her over top performance humor lifts it all above air-headed plot . film itself gets kudos me because , like miss maclaine , it knows exactly what it , comfortable , laugh itself . when she says , " it like one those big budget movies , all love what she wear next " we know there no pretentions here . what this movie . it quinessential movie celebrating girl . it also happens pinpoint rare moment movie history tough women , when boys took over . it deserves it very special pink dvd box . it unique . silly , slapstick , sometimes trying way too hard , but great kick off your shoes , pile up popcorn treat	1

i should bought this dvd before i . i never allow 3.5 star rating distract me again , particularly when some attacks against this dvd infused immature invective against finn personality . pacing , perhaps most important aspect any yoga set , nearly perfect , allowing one truly work body pose while meditating . it almost seems like i am swimming through this session . even though he places set backbends after his salutations before his triangle sequence , somehow everything works . also , this gem some most important poses yoga , whether one classic hatha or power yoga . two single leg standing poses ( warrior iii king dancer ) probably two most important balancing poses yoga . i enjoy how he ends his triangle warrior sequence each one repectively . eion seated pose sequence borrowed straight astanga minor modifications also quite impressive . furthermore , his dvd something every other power yoga set lacks -- complex inverted finishing pose sequence . when complete yoga set performed , it leads rejuvenation no other workout match . i only long version because i am doing this sequence strength yogic complexity completeness . anyone who takes yoga seriously truly wants increase body/mind connection needs this beautifully complete yogic experience	1

it ironic ( or perhaps not ) woody allen mia farrow midst terrible breakup when this film came out . i only saw it recently , it one those films technically would never fly , unless allen behind it . i enjoyed partial-documentary sequences where characters discuss their marriages , breakups , etc ., dark comedy surrounds it all . sydney pollack judy davis old married couple you think would stay together forever , but they're breaking up . woody finds himself strangely drawn one his writing students ( juliette lewis makes film ! ) , who seems get every man she meets string without even trying , mia hooks up liam neeson ... there certain shallowness protrayed when it comes people , really hit me . perhaps i going through my own marriage breakup time i saw this awhile back , it struck chords me i didn't think it would . any case , this not madcap woody film . it sometimes harsh examination how people deal each other , don't always realize what they've got . you need right mood this one , but it worth time	1

this difficult movie me review , because my attachment original book . adam wacky , fun-filled sci-fi romp novel so rich ideas movie can't really more than touch few more important themes . movie tries hard here but i say some best ideas left out , no doubt due time money contraints . but some adams best ideas characters made it into film , few notable omissions , which i mention below . even conceding those few omissions , movie visually appealling breathtaking special effects . however , i few problems flick , although i enjoyed it thought it good flick overall . main problem i movie i think casting could better . still , it good although not stellar . example , sometimes actors seemed less than absorbed involved movie , except brief scenes here there , i thought most convincing players stolid unprepossessing vogons who beaurocratic bad guys film , although john malkovich character good . but then one expects mr. malkovich perform his role his usual ability panache , even if film itself less than stellar . also alan rickman good voice depressed robot . also , i said , some best ideas left out , such restaurant end universe party there , bumbling but sensitive cops . i'm sure many adams fans wonder why those very funny entertaining scenes omitted , but no doubt practical considerations made their omission necessary . i still enjoyed movie despite these flaws , dazzling special effects probably worth paying freight see movie just themselves . but i suspect die-hard adams fans miss original inspiration adams goofy , fun-filled sense wonder made actual books such phenomenon . still , all all fun movie worth seeing despite few shortcomings	1

while i occasionally grew frustrated this film , i soon realized what director roeg trying . this should left up individual viewer figure out . what should particularly noted here not only gorgeous location photography , gorgeous indoor photography roeg use color , but also wonderful performance theresa russell milena wanton heroine . she simply beautiful . story two polar opposites ( art garfunkel russell ) meeting colliding psycho-sexual relationship told fragmented , flashback fashion get confusing . but if you stick it , it powerful charge . it no way pleasant or amusing . culmination their unhappy relationship disturbing even appalling . there other films similar themes ( " betty blue " " turkish delight " come mind ) but they were'nt quite this dark . recommended adults only	1

shutter would probably rate one better asian ghost flicks come out over last couple years . i stated review movie red shoes this style movie getting too clich�d . after taking break few months i recently started watching asian ghost movies again . only major downfall shutter several movies came out after it released states first so takes away some impact . i seen shutter during its initial release i'm sure i would liked it more . now that not say i didn't enjoy shutter because i very much . but like i said several movies came out after shutter just happened released here first . despite clich�s shutter , proves asian filmmakers still capable making movie like this make it enjoyable . unlike some other ghost movies it takes while before haunting begins . normally few things start happen it foreshadowing things come . but shutter it starts happen rather early stays through movie , which what helped keep movie moving . let honest here though long haired asian girl doesn't exactly strike fear it once viewer . we seen it so many times now it lost its impact bit . but directors banjong pisanthanakun parkpoom wongpoom still able make best scenes they able make several scenes lot creepier than they really should . while i can't say i scared , but there several very suspenseful tense moments , which majority lacking recent movies like this . all asian ghost flicks i seen recent none badly made they just suffered too many clich�s , but this movie able make best them . mystery angle rather solid , but same time i felt more time needed would made movie even stronger . while script wasn't bad , shutter sometimes bit slow when there no ghostly haunting . characters ok ; while they weren't boring they weren't strong enough carry movie when there no ghost . but said there very interesting twist character tun . he not innocent most characters these movies excellent change pace . like i said there flaws ; again we seen this style movie played out , while characters good they just weren't interesting enough carry movie too long . besides clich�d only problem i shutter some scenes just fall bit flat . me it just seemed characters often repeating themselves scenes just different words . that not say shutter wasn't well-written ; it solid script most part . but there also several things shutter excellent . scene when ghost side car creepy scene provided great jolt when ghost chases tun around late movie one creepiest scenes i seen asian ghost flick quite sometime . those new this style movie i would say shutter should one first films you see so it doesn't lose impact scenes . those who well schooled these movies , shutter won't offer you anything you haven't seen before . but said it far one better asian ghost movies despite clich� it probably keep you entertained . i stated earlier review several movies made after shutter just happened released here states first , which shame because it hurt movie little bit . closing despite clich�s some flaws , shutter excellent movie shows there still some life left this sub-genre .	1
i bought this dvd because i ~ apparently unlike many other buyers ~ thought first season best ; especially first half first season . back when it addressed what it like move across country , or just out your own , after college professional , social , financial issues we faced doing so . after season one , melrose place went touching meaningful yet nighttime soap ( albeit fun one ) . if you want suds catfights , stick later seasons . if you want wonderful friendships some drama ~ reminder those wonderful terrifying times ~ definitely buy this dvd set	1

it great see something totally different come out asia . while their ghost stories aren't only ones produced they most popular over there states . it sort like american slasher movies if you look around 80s dominated them , but isn't all made american horror . after my last viewing ghost movie , which south korean movie red shoes i decided take break . while not bad it just suffered same basic formula past movies . bloody reunion there no asian ghost girl found , which nice change . i wanted see this movie quite some time , but what i got wasn't what i really wanted . i'll skip plot rehash since there already description here amazon . lot people compared this friday 13th due whole deformed kid . besides bloody reunion very little common friday 13th flicks . first half bloody reunion quite slow we meet characters , but around midway mark things start come out we learn past grudges . while , bloody reunion interesting set up my problem there no sense dread doom lingering . i never got feeling something bad gonna happen . john carpenter halloween it michael myers always lurking back round . dario argento it deep red despite killer only appearing when they killed . director lim dae-woong doesn't bad job , but he just doesn't create any mood first half . he try , but it just wasn't working . 2nd half when things pick up killer starts knocking off all characters one one . but problem killer shows up attacks . it not always kill scenes its more how it built up lot times . best parts movies like halloween , deep red original black christmas set ups not actual kill scenes . bloody reunion some graphic murders , which fine , but again there wasn't much set up . characters ok maybe if i cared more them approach would worked better . none characters really stood out honestly they all alike . i'll give credit makers going character development . we learn little them , maybe more so then your average run mill slasher flick , but when all said none stand out enough . asian horror isn't really known their gore these days , but i noticed they getting little bit more violent . bloody reunion some violent murder scenes while they cool looking i just wasn't all interested . one thing bothers me horror movies these days twist endings . it seems like every horror flick take some kind twist end . some work some don't some just seem they sake it . first twist bloody reunion might little confusing , but it all pretty much explained . but my problem twist without giving anything away it sort renders everything came before it rather pointless . i've seen other movies twist like this , but i don't know they seemed work where here it just didn't . i really wanted like movie while i didn't hate it i just walked away thinking how it really could so much more than it . it nice change pace though asian horror . ghost story really seems run its course . i like slasher movies , but not much i when i child . those into slashers asian horror you might like bloody reunion . again i didn't hate it , but i feel it could better . my opinion it more 2 half star movie , but since isn't option i decided go 2-star rating . bloody reunion doesn't come highly recommended , but it not bad boring night nothing .	-1

if you're looking over-the-top action sort sit down enjoy movie without overanalyzing it , this one you . some movies you pick all plot holes inconsistencies , but if you want action movie that loaded full action plus some obligatory dry humor , you can't go wrong last boy scout . fans bruce willis shouldn't miss this movie either . willis plays alcoholic detective who recieves call colleague his surveillance exotic dancer named cory ( played halle berry ) . but when cory gets killed professional hit right front her boyfriend ( played wayans ) detective , 2 team up figure out why she killed course , true action film style , there much more than meets eye . it fast-paced exciting provides plenty laughs . amazon reviewer said something effect this movie shows great contempt women i just didn't get this flick . maybe i just too mesmerized bruce willis , but whatever case , last boy scout entertain you down very last second .	1
i loved this movie , if only tommy lee jones tom wood ( don't know who ? don't worry , i'm only one ) because it sequal my most favourite movies . but if you're not considering this movie because your fantatical devotion single actor or series , then take your time deciding . director firs t-t imer , plot almost completely identical fugitive ( except ... tommy lee jones wesley snipes aren't cool together tommy harrison ) there fair number awkwardly ' funny bits ' . i would rate it average cop drama , fairly underwhelming sequel . however , i loved it , but i suspect my motives little different than most peoples ' .	-1

" those who tardy not get fruit cup ! " trying explain why you like one mel brooks film no particular feeling like trying explain why one guy slipping banana peel funny guy doing same medical emergency . all i know i think line , especially stated nurse diesel , uproarious high anxiety one my favorite mel brooks films . some say it take-off hitchcock , or even satire . far it , my view . i think it affectionate , good-natured hug brooks director he respects . so , one level , we sit back enjoy hitchcockian references , some which very clever . level , we still enjoy famous brooksian low comedy sends one gag after almost fast we blink . when two come together ... when birds splatter fleeing dr. thorndyke , instance ... it match made heaven . besides , anyone who turn man strangled telephone booth into coy phone sex scene my vote . sure , movie erratic , but that brooks . what makes so many gags work , i think , brooks , dignified , mystified dr. thorndyke , observer . brooks this movie reacts things far more often than he instigates . if you enjoy hitchcock films flash -- vertigo , north northwest , psycho , spellbound , under capricorn , notorious , birds such -- there built-in level affectionate amusement . high anxiety , all it imperfections , funny . this no criticism many brooks ' other films , but i also think high anxiety lot charm , more than any his except young frankenstein producers ( first version ) . brooks outstanding job playing thorndyke , new head psychoneurotic institute very , very nervous . he may center story , but it quiet center ; he surrounds himself memorable grotesques he not afraid let steal their own scenes . among others , there harvey korman ( " less bondage , more discipline ! " ) , madeline kahn playing one hitchcock blonde ice queens , cloris leachman playing remarkably ugly head nurse fitted out what seems armor-plated bra , assortment low comics doing fine bits , including charlie callas patient who thinks he cocker spaniel . don't let him get close your leg . one moment when brooks grabs film himself when dr. thorndyke persuaded hotel bar take mike sing . brooks such great combination cheery lounge lizard self-consciously swinging sinatra he almost stops movie its tracks . dvd transfer , my opinion , almost disgrace . it way too soft slightly washed out . there no excuse releasing well-known modern movie careless shape this dvd . just regardless audience , studio given no extras any consequence nothing brooks himself	1

i'd say i disappointed when i first saw first episodes unlimited . it named final fantasy , but very little linked it incredible video game series same name . story seemed immature generic not interwoven many character driven side stories ; only final fantasy mascots appeared ( chocobo , one ); music didn't reflect classical style went games . so , needless say , i didn't bother buying anymore dvds series . then box set came out , i admitted myself i least curious how this series would end , plus i learned gonzo made unlimited , gonzo yet fail me any my anime endeavors . i bought it , i watched first episodes again . i cringed , because suddenly i felt same way even found few more things i disliked it . but i didn't stop , continued watch , found , slowly , this series evolved . it became emotionally driven , lot elements made final fantasy great . there mascots galore ( stated chocobo , cactuar , moogles , summons , cid ) . some music heard heard previous games ( opening song -- not title song -- battle victory ) . still , it wasn't final fantasy its namesake , but i found watching anime entire way through okay . though it isn't good chapter final fantasy , it great stand-alone anime nonetheless . it great animation , strange style seems both classical cutting edge ( astroboy cg ) . story deepens two main characters search their parents , other story lines reveal themselves well , such kaze story , main character charge powerful gun capable summoning creatures into battle , lisa , martial artist power control elements . antagonists also turn into something more than they beginning . deeper , more sinister foe appears later , one adds sense dread story wasn't there previously . all all , it adds up one decent anime . value itself can't beaten . twenty-five episodes anime less than fifty-bucks . it difficult , however , recommend this anime . i'd only recommend this final fantasy fans who don't take game too serious . if you , you'll disappointed this anime . i'd also recommend it anyone who enjoys experimentation their animation . if you enjoyed kid story animatrix , you'll enjoy this	1

this set starts when richard bucket retires his work . just think , all day home his wife , hyacinth . if you've watched series , you imagine horror . this set , we see more haycinth sisters , father neighbors . they get more screen time this set than first four dvds . we also finally see hayacinth sister , violet , her husband , bruce . still no sign their son , sheraton , though . patricia routledge excellent job playing part stuck-up , snobby , british housewife high social ambitions . she plays character so well , she really makes you hate character hyacinth bucket make you feel great compassion everybody encounter her . psychological torture inflicted hyacinth her neighbors acquaintances becomes more developed more apparent set . one cannot help but feel great sympathy everyone she talks ( good laugh same time ) . extras so-so . they include some outtakes , interview patricia routledge clive swift british tv show , cast biographies , " memoirs hyancinth bucket " ( one hour flashback episode ) , some other stuff . if you plan buy series , i recommend you " keeping up appearances - full bouquet set " ( 8 dvds ) amazon.com, it much cheaper than buying this set first set individually . side note , there one episode where i think writers took hyacinth out character . she party which she invited some new neighbors , but she also invited her " socially unacceptable " family ( daisey , onslow , rose ) this party . normally , she would never this side her family mingle her parties .	1

reason your getting this obviously youve seen this show sci-fi found it entertaining ... now only difference i found this broadcast version sound par fuzzy ... sometimes you need turn tremble/bass down bit make sound little easier understand when fellas talking loudly ... but most part its not too terrible ... visually its pretty good but little pixelated during night/dark room scenes , but you take into consideration these sets giving you 4 dvds $20 dollars ... if you wanted remastered video/audio edition , youd probably paying price other seasons tv shows mid $50 dollar range ... so i just try not complantive things enjoy show its substance ... its worth price very entertaining ... so i highly suggest picking up copy so when season 3 finished we fans get next season dvd ... hope i helped you decide this ... ro	1

i ordered this 2 dvd set , including both original " fly " " return fly " starring vincent price , " grand seigneur " ( master ) fantasy sci-fi genre . i am glad i . i could ordered remake its counterpart " fly ii " , but i preferred start beginning i righ t.t he classics may less sophisticated sfxs ( special effects ) , but acting far superior . ambience two , typically fifties , adds charm whole . music tense , but not overbearing eighties movies screaming girl there , where one wants her , right time too ... who forget finale original " fly " , almost work slapstick comedy , but so dramatically funny . second follow-up , " return fly " not so brilliant , lacking glamour color ( although cinemascope ) , its story comes goes , but still valid sequel those very campy " drive-in " movies . whilst first , vincent price just shoulder al hedison , second he truly becomes star action . everyone who loves particular feeling fifties widescreen movies , won't disappointed . both not considered horror movies , or just science fiction ones , although elements both genres present , no , more likely , i would call them twist " film noir " genre . fact , especially first one , entire plot told while police investigation conducted , clarify vicious murder case . second , we more crime movie , which mobster blackmailing hero , obvious tragic consequences . while watching these two installments , one keep mind fifties , science fiction horror movies considered minor secondary genre . taste time western spectaculars crime movies , such said , so-called " film noir " . combining both fantasy/sci-fi genre truly daring move , well touch pure genius . doing so , allowed producers take some liberties its contents , emphasizing some elements exagerating others , build necessary tension style reaching well constructed climax end . both movies more than worth money spent , even newcomers fifties movies . while ' 80s version its own appeal , more modern adding some truly scary effects story , it not make it more interesting or more appealing viewers . i like jeff goldblum actor , but i cannot see him stealing seat vincent price . granted , he not play his role . while fifties you happy canadian family , its head , hard-working scientist , we ' 80s , receive eccentric scientist who slowly goes mad moreover solitary guy lose tie female journalis t.t his " fly " part one . part two , we also differences . said , " return fly " ( 1959 ) more crime movie legendary rescue hero its final revenge scene . " fly ii " , 1988 , fumbled attempt create sequel . jeff goldblum geena davis gone altogether . they don't even get chance cameo roles . we totally unknown actors something meant new story altogether . " return fly " we vincent price reprising his original role stealing show . nevertheless , now both versions out , when doubt , buy them both . also 1980s " fly " series available compact collection also affordable price . my suggestion you , viewers , buy them both then compare them yourselves . but warned . if you faint heart , ' 80s collection rather gory could cause you some visual shocks , while ' 50s versions more stylized lot left your imaginations work out . it up you	1

how delightful learn this movie issued again dvd . i little more than echo praise other reviewers . it worth its weight gold . i first saw it soon after it came out , when i young teenager . i so impressed , many months afterwards , i wanted nothing more than become coronet player . i eventually settled piano lessons , somewhat later , guitar . there no question my mind " five pennies " seminal influence my decision learn music . result , playing music one those activities i still enjoy i meander through my sixties . this movie resides my deepest memories such classics " westside story " " breakfast tiffany .

this first box set released season one pokemon . this collector set indeed only 4kids american dub no second japanese version . it contains three discs ; each nice hard case slide into one cardboard sleeve . artwork box each individual case nicely . set contains first 26 episodes season one . note though , this not entire first season american version contains 78 episodes ( 80 japan ) . this means , according my calculations , two more box sets would need released ( each containing 26 more episodes ) complete season . also , aware episode , " beauty beach , " not its rightful slot not part this set . even though it first banned during season one , it later played " lost episode pokemon " during orange islands season ( though heavily edited ) . it not clear why episode not reinserted back into this season , would make logical sense . menus decent but nothing spectacular . when it comes scenes selection , each episode divided into only two parts . first , before commercial break , second , coming after break . video quality looks pretty good . after comparing color episode one this set version originally released dvd just three episodes , i found colors slightly brighter or vivid this version than other . overall , this best edition season one there date . it worth purchase if you not mind american version . hopefully , they release rest season one very shortly . i rate this product 4 out 5 stars because it not contain episode " beauty beach .	1

may i am little unfair my sweeping statement these episodes . it just so clear me mr culp mr cosby so tune each other peak their game any woodeness which natural bit part players exaserbated . said i loved episode american empress because enigmatic france nuyen fantastic it she brilliant engaging every episode she starred . someone who yet see san francisco these episodes like tourist brochure where go what see . tag your it particular favourite mine because scotty kelly hippy disguise interaction each other shop owner . whole these definitely not best i spy episodes , but because show exceptional every sense word this statement mine not inditement these four episodes which still very entertaining .	1

even it original 3 hour running time , film still felt bit too hefty . like lot cases extended editions ( opposed director cut ) , extended version simply alternate take ; kind optional version film should you feel compelled see it . i always liked dances wolves , directorial debut kevin costner multiple academy award winner , but i always felt like sum its parts won me over but maybe not unified whole . lt . john dunbar united states officer during civil war after unsuccessful suicide attempt him running bare into enemy fire but miraculously surviving , he option posted anywhere . he picks fort sedgewick , distant remote outpost where he'll live himself . hanging around camp wolf he names two-socks nearby sioux village over time , he becomes friends even becomes part their community . relationship one women develops but he still deal approaching officers who want conquer more land , effectively driving out sioux . extra scenes meant develop story offer more background taken their own , they actually work pretty fine . instead finding dunbar new post deserted , we actually see officers previously stationed just left . we get more screentime some minor characters which help flesh them out but takes away dunbar himself losing focus him . all scenes gives off feeling making movie more longer than it should ( costner says himself commentary when he says " it not secret i like long movies " ) but luckily there disc change so you don't watch all 4 hours one setting . far film concerned , it quite great film some gorgeous cinematography , excellent performances some pretty exciting action scenes . costner might not most immense range but there quite few films where he convincing this one them . i 2 complaints whole : narration read like kid who asked read book passages class kind uninvolving drone . when officers show up they almost this kind malevolent quality where they're portrayed hick morons guns . other than though i don't any issues film while it probably something i won't turn constantly , whenever i watch it i still like it . one concern i wish addressed where special features . it reminds me lord rings extended cuts where all main in-depth featurettes longer , expensive cut so while i no issues stuff we get here , 2 commentaries feature-length documentary broken halves , it would've worked bit if option all it theatrical edition would help people who want bonus parts but not it attached longer version film . it probably isn't going everyone cup tea there even times where i'm not big fan but there other times where i get quite involved it so give it shot see what you think . word caution : theatrical edition normally available full screen so it either 4 hour widescreen or 3 hour full . i can't stand full so buying this one inevitable	1

this great movie ! however , i can't show it my students because rating . wish i could	1
first off , i want preface this saying this movie not everyone . there those who like things spelled out them movie those who like challenge , this movie challenge watch , but well worth it . there not lot dialogue this movie i read somewhere director because he wanted capture scenes before after characters would spoken . heat moment , so speak . so what we see characters their most raw vulnerable , entirely naked some cases . without dialogue rely , actors forced use their facial expressions express their emotions which they superbly . i say i found everything this movie refreshing . i like cinematography use vibrant colors certains scenes well muted tones others . everyone movie just plain beautiful look first i felt movie seemed bit long , but then when it kept going there came point where i didn't want it end because i become so invested main characters who not seem superficial all . they very believable we all similar situations our youth . it seems there always something better other side , but there really ? i think fact storyline not totally linear might bother some , but i found it made story more interesting it seemed provide alternative versions or character perceptions what going . i so excited this movie i order director first film " thousand clouds peace " which filmed similar way ( little dialogue , much longing stares , etc ... ) but i found it not quite good . perhaps my expectations set so high this film . still , i think this director watch . next tsai ming liang , i think he my second favorite director now	1
okay , maybe so maybe cutthroat island not really classic . flak this movie suffered , i watched it thinking i would get showgirls type movie : so dreadful it could provide entertainment . instead , usually wooden matthew modine pretty sparkling his weisenheimer role , while usually sparkling gina davis waterlogged wooden her attempts she-pirate . fun whole family	1

if you interested knowing what challenges monarches other powerful people face , this movie great beginning . you may or may not interested russian history or even world history , but this particular story greatly encapsulates emotional , physical political issues faced two powerfully-born adults their children . other reviews this site terrific their critical perceptions this movie its strengths weaknesses , so i not go into too much detail " sell " anybody action or dialogue , or historical accuracy . suffice say this movie -- its unedited version ( crucial dvd ) fact tell it like it ( or ) . nicholas alexandra two human beings who happened born into western dynastic system still prevalent turn 20th century . they responsible , almost biblical sense , destiny humanity , only they opted out , then executed . this would considered " romantic " if humanity not such overwhelming need leadership designated heroes . dvd version critical see full relationship alexandria rasputin surrendering power , also see rasputin his full decadent expression ( which must positively repulsive russian history revisionists . ) it also necessary , emotional historic context , see " failure " nicholas -- he could no longer carry responsibility godhead . it also relevant see execution rasputin hands two hop-head fairies who also line inherit this godhead , they themselves dreams american incorporation . alexia ( nicholas alexandra only son , who also happened hemophiliac ) hates his persecutors very personal , adult hatred -- those who persecuted romanov dynasty people who hated themselves took hatred out leaders they loved despised . they loved their leaders , despised their need leaders . if you purchase this movie , whatever your reason or interest , please buy dvd so it unedited ( meaning uncensored ) so thatyou may judge yourself	1

due circumstances beyond my control , i watch this . , surprisingly , i enjoyed it am dive into written word . this milestone someone who embraced literature much his life , but avoided anything pre-1800s , especially shakespeare . anyway , aside , some impressions film : 1 . liked black white , set design , costumes , overall artistic design . 2 . thought there some really great artistic scenes , especially ophelia floating water . 3 . olivier hamlet : okay , but he seemed lack particular vitality perhaps better-suited younger less-mannered actor .	1

this third cheech chong film , coming after up smoke ( 1978 ) cheech chong next movie ( 1980 ) . films series traditional way -- characters continue , there something linear development per films ' chronologies characters , but plot this film isolation , threads holding it all together pretty thin . nice dreams , cheech chong selling dope barely disguised ice cream truck . they may struck it rich this point , or maybe cheech just doesn't know how read numbers very well . any rate , they not seem hurting money -- they bag it , after all , which they pursue later film -- somehow , they're living very expensive , big house beach outside los angeles , although it seems maybe they're just crashing friend friend place while he away ( he musician tour ) . lot it pretty unclear , because last thing cheech chong writers director ( only chong latter case ) concerned telling anything like traditional story . instead , it seems like maybe they high while they wrote filmed this . that usually meant negative -- idea denote how little sense work makes , or how little coherence it . i don't mean it way here . i don't mean it knock , necessarily . i mean it literally , consequently underscore kind stream-of-consciousness , absurdist surreal flow . those all very positive qualities , they occasionally here . but maybe cheech chong just looking easiest way string together number sketch ideas , not enough sketch ideas , because some them drawn out or reprised past their freshness date . probably goes whole premise cheech man ( chong ) selling dope getting into wacky situations while pursued sgt . stedanko ( stacy keach ) . nice dreams feels too much like cheech chong just coasting -- vamping while waiting next soloist start . although i love experimentation much anyone else , this film would benefited stronger focus telling story traditional way . i don't always think something different better just because it different . so this definitely step down first two films , although there more than enough funny moments keep fan first two films mildly entertained , most supporting actors , including returning ones , enjoyable even more potential . some skits ( word fits here better than " scenes " ) , like crazy house fiasco donna apartment , even " save whales " song , good most material first two films . but overall , it just seems like their hearts , maybe their heads , weren't much into making film time around	-1
unique screen chemistry john wayne katharine hepburn barely elevates western rehash " african queen .

this not your average crime story . clint eastwood plays man we first encounter preacher rural church . shortly into sermon , gunman comes starts shooting preacher . he takes off running eventually gets picked up young man played jeff bridges . two hit it off become buddies , even though eastwood character significantly older than bridges ' . over time , it learned eastwood bank robber . after big heist , money disappeared people who trying kill him think he stole it ( other crooks ) . eventually , they hit upon scheme rob same bank same manner before . idea nobody would expect them try things same way again . there trouble other robbers . one stupid other just plain mean . after successful heist , this leads problems which film must resolve . although action line movie story bank robbery , it really friendship two main characters . it touching watch sad unexpected end . it rather dated film but it still worth watching .	1
course this not best movie world , or even best french movie . but it entirely life-enhancing , shows truffaut humanity humane feeling . it certainly film watch if you're feeling low want cheered up . it so clever way truffaut deals himself : actor playing part director film , ferrand , director , , course , director actual film . he gets wonderful performances jean-pierre leaud ( his other self , here several previous films including les quatre cents coups ) , nathalie baye , most especially english actress jacqueline bissett ( whom he supposed affair during making film . truffaut one great letter-writers , up byron , joyce virginia woolf ( google book ) , both his letters this film show virtues catholic atheism : he not shred religious belief , but he extraordinarily kind understanding man who yet entirely obsessive film . watch this if you down , pick yourself up trufo after : master-work	1
worth seeing , no doubt . however , makes you wonder what true genius like akira kurosawa would such original premise . this director here misses masterpiece film his hands something like hair . three main characters better developed audiance would more reason togive damn what happens them . alas , it didn't happen , although script pretty damn decent works most part . i said following so often past : give audiance something/someone care -- because if they don't kow much people your film they not moved what happens them . just way it . said all , i still maintain it worth seeing . branko djuric very good here . check it out . i wish i could given it five stars	1

this one my favorite movies . it immaculate : it not single wasted second -- it tight spellbinding . filmmakers juxtaposed tale horrific spree killing young very likeable sociopath/psychopath/psychokiller , played brilliantly martin sheen . when we first meet him , he young , southern good ol ' boy ton grace equal measure charm , tough , seemingly extremely self-assured , macho , self-reliant . he just this odd little quirk blowing people away if they irritate him too much or if they get his way , then stepping over their bodies , proceeding next moment . he obviously ill educated , ignorant , yet some point we see he made decision carry himself great pride , self-assurance , masculinity , whatever his circumstances . my favorite exposition his personality when he finally arrested ; he chats policeman though they just bunch good ol ' boys sitting around bar he buying drinks ; just cool cucumber , friendly , totally disingenuous . kind " what you see what you get , " now let get it . not hair out place , not tremor or tic indicate rage , malice , or , dare i say it , evil . juxtaposed him sissy spacek character , who sweet , young , totally sheltered , dumb , naive , but who also seems no trouble stepping over bodies putting her energy into staying alive doing what she get through moment . juxtaposed wonderful music -- something like calliope music , sweet dreamy . juxtaposed wonderful cinematography -- shots midwestern prairie , often flat , sometimes golden , never bleak . it totally mesmerizing satisfying . i hope i'm not only one who could not horrified all terrible bloodshed murder--i'm passing buck this marvelous film , which gave us story mass murder balletic fanciful context	1

okay , maybe last one isn't really european , but you get point . i watched this over weekend , rental everyone favorite blockbuster video ! i loved this movie ! it took us where roadtrip wishes it could taken us ! i really liked " scenery " way . i didn't rent this movie longest time , cover showed some goofball white dude pointing his fingers funny way this goofy smile ( he almost looked mentally handicapped ) it just looked so " dumb . " honestly . but cover unrated version , shows young female actress removing her bikini top , it looks damn hot ! also , unrated version ton more sexy scenes , including lots nudity . i also believe this first dvd i've rented gave index nude scenes , well index additional " unrated " scenes . now that' hot ! movie very funny , put together well . i felt like they actually europe , when you watch some special features , you learn they actually . i felt like hit every country they said they , but something tells me it only 1 or 2 , they used stage sets . but , scenes all realistic looking . i especially noticed this vatican . damn funny ! some other reviewers comparing this other american clowning movies , but i didn't see it way . i saw it us making fun their stereotypes . i mean how could you sex comedy europe , not berlin or netherlands comedy scene . scene where italian businessman keeps molesting tourists ? i roommate said italian man kept chasing her molesting her city bus , so yes , stereotypes based some aspects reality . get over your pc correctness ? okay ? it funny , because its partially true ! i stop short giving this five stars , but i give it this rating :d vd movie alone : 4 starsdvd movie special features : 5 starsmc white said : check it out !!	1

usual gene hackman perfectly cast this dark portrayal us international forces monitoring bosnian/serbian conflict . i caught end this film cable channel it forever imprinted my memory . after watching film again beginning end it become one my favorite " war " type films , realistic , dark gritty . if you like owen wilson prepared shock . many films he cast comedic roles jackie chan films , zoolander wedding crashers but this film shows true depth his abilities serious actor . this far my favorite owen wison film .	1
not your typical thriller ( where car chases .. ) . lord war constructed like documentary plot . cage excellent , so screenplay . movie not-so-subtly speaks against war , arm dealings , developed countries making quick buck misery genocide civil wars while same time hypocriticaly imposing embargos , sanctions , etc . prepared strong language , lot violence sexuality - all which give really gritty surface otherwise sleek story . many quotable one-liners fast pace make it solid entertainment , if you call it this thought-provoking drama .	1
sometimes sequels inferior original but not this case . this 4th inspector clouseau movie ( after pink panther , shot dark , pink panther returns ) they perfected it . combination action , clumsiness peter sellers character , music score henry mancini , fight scenes kato , crazy inspector dreyfuss course classic " your dog bite ? " all there right amount combination . also , movie set during time it filmed which 1976 . if you only own pink panther movie ever , this one . previous three movies funny but imo drag bit times . next one after this one ( revenge pink panther ) came close this one but never eclipsed it	1
this criterion edition includes interveiw forman sheds lot light how this film constructed . use long singles , especially when pianist mother father dialogue , undoubtedly influenced budget constraints , but forman makes aesthetic choice linger mother while she wears down all around her her world-weary nagging . effect you get share what husband , son protagonist going through ; " get me away this woman , please ! " expressions faces both professionals amateurs cast tell story not only drudgery under oppressive political regime , but hopes despairs people suffer kind fraught romantic episodes story woven around . andula story not quite compelling enough justify price tag this dvd - there whole episode involving missing ring enraged suitor pops up disappears without much relevance . modern cinema-goers expect more meat story , i think . however , budding filmmakers learn lot pacing , reaction actors , not moving camera , difference directing professional non-professional actors ( extras interview ) .	1
better move over angelina jolie , asia argento here !! this woman not only sexy , beautiful , vulnerable innocent all same time , but oh so talented . she seems just pour herself right into part . i seen some her other performances this definitely not one movie or one character wonder . if she get commercially viable project then oscar got new leading lady . aside asia , . monkey superb movie splendidly developed love story . it bloody wonderful watch characters change , become exposed draw close one . passion , sensitivity , discovery , growth , intensity , tragedy , love , what more one want ? oh yea , i mention asia	1
i've always big fan arnold , this movie really lets him shine . one highlight ( many film ) confusing/embarrassing scene where arnold misunderstands invited over professor his daughter " tea " ( beatnik-era term marijuana ) . then there sordid scene where booze-addled arnold confesses what he saw hotel room he shares hercules . this scene alone whisks movie out kiddie genre it seems lumped into takes it level completely . yes , pretzy , arnold stang delivers spades . then there arnold schwarzenegger . his english wasn't very good time this made , but this ain't shakespeare he reciting , either . even this early point his career , it obvious man makings actor or politician . fact this movie made 1970 , long after peplum craze over gives it added appeal me . also , character hercules this movie big , strong lummox instead noble hero truer greek mythology than most movies portray him makes it my favorite genre . scene where he mini-tantrum after losing weight lifting competition , stamping his feet giving good herman munster " darn , darn , darn ! " impersonation fine example . although you listen arnold original audio , i prefer dubbed dad-voiced audio option myself . other favorite scenes : hercules falling outside airplane window waving old lady passenger plane , scene times square where hercules takes off his shirt makes his pecs move up down professor daughter .	1

frequent visitor himalayas closely touch both tibetans ( ordinary folks , not tortured ones ) chinese , i find this documentary interesting but terribly one-sided . i not met single wealthy tibetan nepal or india , who swear me he return freed tibet , run their government exile . fair " experts " , lot evidence chinese violence against tibetans real . i sincerely feel sorry them wish they could somehow compensated . however , documentary gets emotive it seems bent presenting situation tibet entirely viewpoint activists other victims chinese aggression . while it true many tibetans suffered died during invasion subsequent crushing riots erupted time time , it unfair assume soldiers police only ones responsible deaths injuries . there no looters , vandals , infighting ? if you ever witnessed these riots , would you think more people might hurt or killed soldiers not opened fire ? it also incredibly naive assume all tibetans think same . even dharamsala , seat tibetan government exile not without opposition , violence even assasination . while i think most tibetans good buddhists nice people , documentary seems associate everything sinful chinese everything saintly tibetans . this something i find totally unacceptable . few snapshots tibetan mobs welcoming delegates exile tell us nothing . documentary seems only able find tibetans who against chinese rule . they paint picture nobody tibet happy . this patently untrue . but then , this sort thing sells america . you demon , you damsel distress you must hero ( america this case ) . otherwise , it just won't sell . it not compassion all . if you really want " illuminated " , visit tibet tibetan communities all over china see things yourself . would far more enlightening . sadly , many journalists prefer interview wrong ( right ? ) people order get sensational story pay rent	-1

i would gladly take my hour half back . i enjoyed humor st 1 , there only nod direction here - so lame , it only serves draw attention its absence . also , this turns into slasher flick - systematic knock-off each characters exploration how gruesome special effects . now , i'm not necessarily against this , though i don't really care slasher flicks , other than say it becomes super bo-ring ! i mean boringthere not even really " " movie quality here provides something memorable . nope - nothing redeeming here . don't bother	-1

rock who this movie looking malnourished rotted teeth sinister contact lenses make-up ? this movie horrible . but , it typical van damme flick . horrible acting , over-produced cheesy waxy feel it , non-existent storyline usual idiotic ending . i admit though , i most van damme movies . he decent martial artist . my opinion his best movies " kickboxer " " bloodsport " . these his only movies actually enjoyable watch somewhat inspiring . i few observations / comments / questions make should humorous seasoned van damme fan : isn't it funny all his millions dollars van damme can't find plastic surgeon who hide silly bump his forehead ... why must every character van damme plays speak french accent ? he tries play wide variety different action hero roles but always character must some way originate france . isn't this preposterous ? you'd think if van damme serious his " acting " career he would attempted remedy this flaw . i mean , it not like his acting roles all challenging but it would nice if he even partially believable his roles ... why van damme always show his bare rear-end so much ? he think women watching his silly movies ? you'd think someone would realize mostly men watch action films majority men no desire see his naked backside so why show it ? ... it me or van damme need good hair stylist ? his hair especially stupid cyborg . he looks like he should cast " revenge nerds " ... speaking style , it van damme himself who invented stupid tucked shirt pleated dockers pulled up way too high over waist snazzy belt 80 look ? if so , this deed alone he should reprimanded ... why van damme such huge action hero ? he so friggin ' short if you saw him line behind you convenience store i don't think he would look all intimidating . least steven seagal tall tough looking although van damme definitely better shape . you never see seagal showing his muscles .... lastly , even though i laugh van damme i am definitely fan . said , i wonder if any his other fans share my sentiments producers , directors just everyone else involved most his many films . i think they should ashamed way they their work . van damme alot heart , maybe not so much stallone , but more heart than most action heroes like shwarzenegger , etc . people involved most van damme films truly disservice him action film fans everywhere . they should taken pride their work . it not like they weren't paid handsomely their services	-1
big fan roeg , bowie , sci-fi general , i intrigued enough purchase new criterion edition blind buy ( also aided my decision some positive reviews friends whose opinion i trust ) . overall , i think it great decision , if bit pricey . david bowie stars thomas jerome newton , who we first see stumbling around disoriented earth . he technical genius privately arranges meet one oliver farnsworth - scientific breakthrough lofty business plan mind . farnsworth quickly becomes his company manager begins amassing wealth thomas , who wants become rich reasons known only him . scientist , nathan bryce , also commissioned part research development - this time space project . around same time thomas meets young naive girl , mary lou , who helps save his life cares him ( eventually becomes his lover , despite thomas wife ) . while all this going , rival corporation noticed newton success keen bring his empire technology down . course , film like this , none matters all . that because thomas [ i]presumably[/i ] alien who come earth order save his small desert planet his family , who appear only survivors after two successive nuclear wars wrecked havoc planet atmosphere . i say " presumably " because , despite obvious ( scene his eyes , i say no more ) subtle ( his constant need water , his reactions moving fast speed ) visual performance/dialogue clues , film ends rather ambiguously this crucial point . my mind , possible layer newton not alien all rather fascinating . however , if taken surface only , nicolas roeg concocted visually sonically impressive sci-fi classic , fine appropriate misanthropic moody performance david bowie . roeg takes his time develop story around loose framework novel but uses number interesting visuals abstract imagery/metaphor order convey his major themes - loneliness vices man , ruthlessness corporate commercial world , way we would potentially react such visitor ( malice ) . other major theme , course , sexuality power sex destroy ; bryce considered problem because his taste very young women , newton fateful encounter mary lou , however control he may appear first , ends up doing same she introduces him joys follies human sexuality also alcohol ( which screws his system causes hallucinations - much like real life us humans , eh ? ) . film not without flaws . there number bizarre dialogue exchanges , especially newton mary lou , nothing enhance plot or development either character . one particularly fascinating but pretentious sex scene , using gun lot firing blanks sexual allegory , goes forever utterly pointless without context stage film . strange disturbing visual cues abound some particularly effective , but frequent use naked bodies writhing around some kind oatmeal throughout film silly . not nearly enough time spent reasons motivations how exactly newton intends save his planet . still , straightforward linear film would far less compelling not what roeg intended make anyway . it said writer accompanying interview roeg let spirit book guide his choices , large extent true ; he remain faithful [ i]spirit[/i ] narrative not deviate central plot . his distinct visual sense astonishing behold those unfamiliar his work . however , grade film dips slightly because flaws outlined above regard pacing , structure , story . despite all , i'm glad i bought it look forward seeing it again commentary order absorb all details i missed first time . excellent but difficult challenging piece science fiction visionary director - it amazing think " star wars " only year away ....	1

i am young actor europe , sweden i got uta books , respect acting , challenge actor previously my purchase dvd , uta hagan acting class . so , i already read through her books when i got dvd which i felt when viewing dvd must understand dvd . dvd not technical help tool show you how warm up or prepare play role or audition i thought it would . instead it quite amazing thing because you very first minute dvd walk straight into hb studio classroom view everything if you doing sit course you might interested . one then watch her students first get some instructions each exercise she then they based chosen exercise go up stage play dialogues against each other . after some minutes she stop students instead telling them what they wrong ask them if there something they could criticize what they just , why they believe it so ? after students talked their understandings she fill her own give very honest answer everyone . it obvious she knows what she doing her feedback always based how students reached goal exercises or not . i would say it worth buying if one serious acting but if one live close ny i would say you better off saving those money instead go down her studio , hb studio use those money classes ! i don't know how other teachers school but her exercises , her technique i feel just so authentic great something every actor serious his or her acting should master ! only thing this dvd not so good it copy old video 1970 i understand so style sound recording not greatest or up date today fashion . however , real actor probably irrelevant . so , overall i feeel it great dvd i give it 4 5uta created amazing technique based internal acting i feel leads authentic truth like behavior stage . i most definitely go ny take her class ! good luck all actors actresses world ! maybe i'll see you ny !	1
not knowing what expect this movie i went open mind . i amazingly pleased everything this film . it exceeded my every expectation more . chain crimes begins when dishonorable man named mainardi ( george hilton ) blackmails serial killer ( michel antoine ) into murdering his wife . after young couple ( alessio orano cristina galb�) burglarize murderer car , newly deceased corpse its trunk , killer sets off maniacal crime spree . film moves steady clip , camera movements slick professional cinematography makes great use shadow create atmosphere heighten tension . film receives stunning 2.35.1 anamorphic widescreen transfer taken film original negative . aside some really minor print damage shows up form odd speck here there , very occasional scratch , this transfer looks amazing . acting good all around , however , antoine steals show magnificent cruel , conscienceless killer . cozzi direction also brilliant he pays homage great dario argento initials d.a killers lighter . " killer must kill again " ( otherwise known " il ragno " , or " spider " ) great 70 giallo classic fans genre certainly enjoy .	1
talk challenge ! make movie which , all purposes , really no beginning ( " fellowship ring " ) no end ( " " return king " ) hard enough . try living up bar set forth its prequel ! this movie spectactular , although it really should watched context least first movie . extra scenes ( 45 minutes worth ) spectacular , extras dvds masterful . i'm type likes know much i whatever i'm watching , i extremely satisfied this set .	1

one first vampire series some interesting storylines ( few oddities here there ) since this season one you usually wouldnt expect much but since i seen own trilogy i tell you season 1 3 all thats really needed full story unless you die hard fan like me em all . some best features this set episodes nick attempting become human yet again finale nick bear decision whether or not turn his friend , his love , into vampire ! so sure buy this set if you buy season one . reason i say pt 3 needed because it end conclusion story even though it wasn't what i'd hoped it would it , always my favorite older vamp series didnt need big buget special effects win you over .	1

late 1960s academy award winner clint eastwood ( pale rider , unforgiven ) certainly established himself actor such features good , bad ugly ( 1966 ) , hang ' em high ( 1968 ) , where eagles dare ( 1968 ) before also taking role director his film play misty me ( 1971 ) . high plains drifter ( 1973 ) eastwood 2nd directing gig , written ernest tidyman ( shaft , french connection ) featuring eastwood himself . also appearing verna bloom ( animal house ) , geoffrey lewis ( every which way but loose ) , marianna hill ( schizoid ) , mitch ryan ( lethal weapon ) , jack ging ( sssssss ) , stefan gierasch ( silver streak ) , ted hartley ( ice station zebra ) , walter barnes ( every which way but loose ) , anthony james ( unforgiven ) , dan vadis ( bronco billy ) , billy curtis , one many little people featured film wizard oz ( 1939 ) . film , which takes place seaside mining town known lago , begins we see lone horseback rider ( eastwood ) traveling across shimmering desert landscape , making his way towards town . his arrival draws much attention , particularly three gun-toting yahoos who , after getting uppity stranger , soon find themselves dead . turns out trio weren't just you run mill riff raff , but gunmen hired town protection , specifically against three other men , soon released prison , who townsfolk believe return revenge ( seems three men currently prison once held position three now deceased men held , before particular incident occurred they railroaded into jail ) . anyway , town leaders , now without their hired guns , decide offer stranger position protectorate , given ease which he dispatched their previous choices , stranger accepts only after promised complete run town . deal seems like good one , until stranger starts taking liberties above beyond what they believe fair equitable , causing consternation among more than few residents ( result townspeople start turning each other ) . stranger begins making good his end bargain ( setting up drills such men town ) , three men , including stacey bridges ( lewis ) his cousins cole dan carlin ( james vadis , respectively ) released prison proceed make their way towards lago , their intent seek reparations against town them wrong . town prepares their arrival ( including spiffy , new paint job , stranger behest ) , we continue learn more more past incident within town , one gruesome secret shared all , rationalized away most . me this very straightforward tale what goes around , comes around , especially terms everyone lago getting exactly what they deserved based their level involvement past , unspeakable events . i've stuff my life come back bite me ash , but never extent depicted here ... then again i never found myself position either participating or witnessing brutal crime ( doing nothing help ) . various points film eastwood character identity questioned , which it never flat out specified but given key aspects film it seemed pretty obvious me . short dream sequence early one should provide good idea where his character coming if not , then final sequence should ( hint , there metaphysical element involved ) . while eastwood character here not name , aspect not meant reflect some his earlier italian made westerns where his character generally not identified characters there here not same . there plenty nastiness film including some whippings , cold-blooded murders , acts misogyny , so , but interestingly enough , they all seem their place within story , especially given what we learn terms despicable secret most all town share . that not say all actions stranger justified but given underlying circumstances they weren't entirely unexpected . overall i think i pretty good handle characters ( their motivations , where they coming , etc . ) , except one female character played marianna hill , who seemed real weirdo . her character would glom onto most dominant male figure present which she would then seem resent them , particularly so stranger , but perhaps this result eastwood character interest her superficial best , something which she felt wasn't accustomed . regardless , she one those women who should wear sign around her neck stating `look , but don't touch ' . far eastwood , well , he eastwood , presents himself much one would expect role like this ( cool , distant , enigmatic ) . i thought his direction wonderful his performance . far rest cast , primarily made up character actors , i thought they all very well , story provided just enough material attention each given their respective roles within film . my favorite part film , besides confrontation sequence end , comes near beginning eastwood character arrives into town , enters saloon , begins getting verbally hassled three roughnecks which he brushes them off heads off shave bath , three troublemakers not far behind . they continue verbal jabs , when they fail get rise out him , they turn violent , forcing stranger react , resulting lesson learned all not mess bull lest you get horns . all all i thought this great film , one better westerns come out 1970s . picture , presented widescreen ( 2.35 : 1 ) , looks pretty decent , but could used little cleaning up , my opinion , there slight flaws present throughout ( when i say `slight flaws ' , i mean minor dust flecks such , but nothing overly obvious ) . audio , presented dolby digital 2.0 mono , both english french , comes through very well . far extras there production notes , cast crew biographies , theatrical trailer , subtitles english spanish . cookieman108	1

when i review movie , i look issues family traditional values discuss picture . this rather obscure canadian movie so it pretty hard find - maybe looking amazon.ca would more productive - looks matter sickness death point view fifteen-year-old girl , tamara . her artist father moves them into house where teenage son owners died leukemia . shortly after moving , tamara mother diagnosed tuberculosis leave family sanitarium . so , tamara her younger brother sister face number issues this movie - moving new location , going new school , dealing serious illness , etc . it happens neighbors across road them ( supposedly ) baptists so tamara soon faced issue religion . [ her mother avowed atheist , but wise enough let tamara decide herself whether go church or not . ] evangelical christian families , this family presents some interesting issues . kids swear like military sailor . what kind christian testimony ? when tamara starts pick up some language , her father no uncertain terms let her know she not use kind language . it really their fruits one knows godly person , not their religious doctrines ? there one delightful scene where three girls two boys go skinny-dipping farm pond . ( my father grew up skinny-dipping , my wife i well , all our kids now my grandchildren continuing tradition , so , course , i could relate . ) this not erotic scene - tamara her siblings , it just way they swam . baptist brother sister , i think there bit rebellion involved . when baptist father discovered them , he " blew his stack . " i feeling if tamara father discovered them , he would joined kids cooling off ! after watching hundreds movies dealing children , it also refreshing see one where children both parents . not only , they both very loving parents . course , her age , tamara really angry her father - how well i know .

" second chorus " not widely known film , but it probably enjoyable any fan fred astaire . if you're not particularly fond astaire , you might want pass this one since seeing astaire action unusual role main attraction . story danny o'neill ( fred astaire ) hank taylor ( burgess meredith ) leaders band . two intentionally failing college , because they like atmosphere , also because long they officially students they spend their time running band making pretty good living it . when ellen miller ( paulette goddard ) enters picture , they both get greedy want her attention themselves . thus they each double-cross other both wind up getting expelled university , thus ending their cozy arrangement their band . they spend most rest film continuing double-cross one , this time over trying get into artie shaw band well trying win over affections ellen , who now works shaw . end , danny hank patch things up decide work together , good results coming their teamwork . things not so great this film mainly quality video , less than great comic timing , tiresome scenes . lester chisholm , played charles butterworth . mr. butterworth no edward everett horton , less-than-adequate character actor you just want shoo guy off stage every time he turns up . also , if you're watching this film see lots astaire wonderful dancing , you'll likely somewhat disappointed . he some singing dancing , but this film mainly shows off his comic abilities , which mischievous astaire plenty . this part would better if comic timing script tighter , though . second feature , " that dancing " documentary made 1985 same lines " that entertainment " . however , my humble opinion " that entertainment " it before it better . actually , this documentary seems bit drawn out lacks excitement its predecessor . however , you get see some good shots astaire others doing some pretty impressive dancing . considering low cost this double feature , ardent astaire fan it probably worth it	1

teen comedies always turn up big business box office , this generally due fact creative forces behind these movies include plenty crude humor , sex , nudity allowed under mpaa ratings system . most time these teen comedies dime-a-dozen , opening big fading shortly thereafter , little lasting appeal audiences . however , there some successes genre more staying power than others , examples would " animal house " , `scary movie ' franchise , `american pie ' series . those examples successful teen comedies , they all some common traits which they share , basically they packed full sex , nudity , crude humor language . however , one thing these examples successful teen comedies , even unsuccessful ones lack any amount heart or soul story . 2004 , fox studios produced yet teen comedy appease masses short while , " girl next door " . starring elisha cuthbert ( tv " 24 " ) unknown lead actor named emile hirsch , " girl next door " would stand out other teen comedies come before it or even after it , this movie contained one thing i said lacking those others , heart soul . " girl next door " story 18-year-old matthew kidman ( emile hirsch ) , straight-laced , overachieving , good boy who never really lived life fullest . , until he spies his incredibly sexy neighbor ( elisha cuthbert ) changing window , finds through his desire her , he anything everything her . but , matthew gets thrown somewhat loop when he discovers his perfect `girl next door ' actually former porn star , who trying forget life she used lead . now , matthew sheltered life quickly begins spin out control he attempts help his new girlfriend leave life she knew embrace life she longs . reason i feel this movie far above those other teen comedies i listed , some which i enjoyed way , like i said earlier " girl next door " contains plenty heart soul its story . this movie isn't simply sex , yes there obligatory teen comedy element this movie , but this movie actually discovery sex isn't only thing look relationship someone . prove point main character story , matthew , who way played perfectly emile hirsch , forced learn true meaningful relationship woman , he must get past his lustful desire only want physical body , no regard emotional side woman . lesson he learn hard way , it forces his character mature throughout story , until finally he able committed relationship this `girl next door ' , he discovers she more than just beautiful woman , former porn star , fact she person real feelings . all she asks matthew he move past her former life see her who she truly . writing this story better than most contained this type movie , generally story fairly thin , pretty much there link each crude joke next or bridge gap sex scenes ; however , this movie story main focus , yes there crude jokes couple sex scenes , but story isn't simply minor plot device get audience these obligatory teen comedy sequences . actors all very good job bringing their characters life , appear enjoying themselves immensely roles they've given . elisha cuthbert emile hirsch share great chemistry helps elevate this movie almost romantic comedy level , instead just teen comedy . timothy olyphant ( " man apart " " scream 2 " ) makes several appearances throughout film shady porn producer , he manages steal almost every scene he , actually provides matthew some rather sage advice , though inadvertently i might add . if you fan teen comedies , but perhaps tired same old thing , then check out " girl next door " , i promise you it more than your average teen , gross-out sex comedy . " girl next door " available both rated unrated editions , both contain language sexuality/nudity	1

this got , without doubt , stupidest most boring piece trash ever make celluloid . what waste time ! it over 10 years since i walked out any movie , but i just couldn't take it any more ! garbage , garbage , garbage ! i read reviews call this movie masterpiece thriller ?? there nothing thrilling this movie all-except fact your just hoping it end some time real soon . talk movie drags !. why anybody would call this " film " anything other than crap completely beyond me . you can't even understand what these characters saying ! ralph fiennes just mumbles , mumbles , mumbles whole time . all he walk around city remember his stupid childhood . father making out prostitute some ramshackle cabin discovered mother , who just stands doorway watching . without word or so much argument or confrontation , father just picks up shovel whacks her head it . boom dead ! why ?? who knows ?? if he wanted her dead so bad he years it . father isn't even shown abusive before . prostitute ? she just starts laughing like it no big deal . then they walk down street his house , drunk laughing ! oh humanity ! dad takes hooker home tells his kid it his new " mommy " ? kid ( spider ) frieken 10 years old or so .... like he really gonna buy into ?? then hooker yells spider tells him daddy killed his mommy ? who would this ? all we get these looooong boring scenes adult spider ( ralph fiennes ) putting puzzles together , mumbling , wrapping himself up newspaper his dingy room . retarded-and very very boring !!!!!!! david cronenburg should not allowed ever direct movie his lifetime after making this heap dung . what he thinking ?? what they all thinking !! absolutely worst - most boring- uninspired movie i seen years . spider so bad it just made me furious ! i felt like i dying long , slow , torturous death !! spider should squashed like bug before production completed . nothing but junk !	-1
i disagree negative reviews this one big time . concert awesome ! picture sound great my tv/stereo system . although different than their concerts late ' 80 early ' 90 ( one should expect ) , jon , always , crowd singing , dancing , waving their arms unison ( not so unison times , lol ) even though it pouring rain fans ( some band ) getting soaked he exhibited his expertise front man he so well . if you looking origional ( cd ) versions not variations or " strays " their songs ( especially their infamous hits yester-year ) , this not cd provide ( though you shouldn't disappointed ) . just note variations mostly , rockers still rockers only 1 exception i think - i especially loved " runaway " rendition - it hauntingly beautiful ballad blew me away i'd buy this dvd again song alone . just their self stated anthem " just older " all i think bon jovi music reflects their maturity band it especially reflects their musical talent genius . fact they now playing 2 generations audiences , many which thought " crush " their first cd , fantastic says lot band their talent their ability appeal more than " just older " crowd ( just check out all young faces crowd absolutely thrilled there rain ) . i also thought it cool concert also broadcast over radio , i sure wish bands here . they played 19 songs total ( i rarely went concert where band played 19 songs - especially rain ! - i've quite few concerts past ) , 3 song encore ( " keep faith " rocked ! ) . awesome fire works show end concert band leaves while " thank you loving me " plays background ... nice touch ending . also interviews , pictures , more dvd . get it while you , it well worth it ! jon , richie , david , tico , hugh ... my hat off you all ! i wish i could there	1

after criticized producing mostly spoof movies , mel brooks departed genre returned semi-real world his early two films " producers " " twelve chairs . " " life stinks " chaplinesque fable focused very real problems america homeless . while it met indifference moviegoing public critics took turns hurling brickbats , practically inviting derision due title , there few perceptive reviewers who recognized this brooks ' most sincere daring effort years . perhaps if title this film " life beautiful , " it would met different fate . nevertheless , this film important entry into brooks canon . putting his money where his mouth , mel brooks made strong social statement well entertaining film . it his most personal work since " producers .	1
this movie my favorite movie . ever . i feel terrible giving it two stars . but it gets 2 stars because i am comparing it rhino version , which i also own . i also own original vhs . i watched this movie least once year since i 8 except 6 years middle school/hs . i sit class watch it memory my head . buy rhino version . if you can't find rhino version , this isn't half bad . its just version much better , since i growing up older copies , new one flaws , minor newcomer , blinding me . i also am physically unable watch any " special edition " star wars because those changes , if gives clue my movie anality . buy rhino version if you find it . one complaint vhs this cool " glitter " effect couple scenes involving energon unicron internals . it present vhs , it came out wrong rhino version , totally gone 20th . thanks deleting part my childhood . comparison rhino version : remaster terrible . mine seems flicker strange artifacts . colors totally off . hot rod basically magenta/pink instead red his orange not orange like orange , it orange like cheaply made basketball . widescreen fake . it cut fullscreen . i wish you weren't such liar , sony . cover art : d- . no detail . looks like whoever new show drew it afternoon or two . matrix looks like honeydew . it would got but prime there . very few extras worth it . i bought this remaster , hoping some clean up restoration glitter effect , they weren't there	-1

all those reviewers ( if you even call them ) who hard time this film , get life ! this film awesome . i must laughed out loud least 50 times . finally , movie tells it like it dating world -- especially new york city . whipped light hearted comedy ( crude times ) never takes itself too seriously . few these reviewers might benifit doing same ??	1
so many folks already know plot resolution " tale two cities " , detailed review unnecessary . this may lessen suspense but should not diminish appreciation this fine movie . this well-done mgm classic old school . ttc set against french revolution 1789 , but absence french accents not detract . neither " paris " obviously shot hollywood back lot . ronald colman lead virtually carries picture . he plays slacker london lawyer who clears young frenchman , donald woods , trumped up charges . woods moved england escape treacherous atmosphere smoldering paris . woods ' uncle , played basil rathbone , planted fake charges . br over top effete , haughty , snobbish french aristocrat . colman woods love same young woman , elizabeth allen , crux ttc . woods wins her hand but makes mistake returning paris-and promptly thrown into cooler sentenced death . prove his amour allen , colman visits woods prison -and switches places waiting list guillotine ! subrogation completely believable , not maudlin least . ttc moves briskly ; most not notice two-hour run time . less time would inadequate involved plot . it , viewers should still watch ttc closely fullest appreciation . some key scenes brief ! ttc shot beautiful black white-perfect gloomy subject matter . why anyone would colorize-or remake ! - this classic mystery . original cannot improved upon . this reviewer so impressed film , he bought book , perfect compliment/complement any self-respecting movie	1

i watched " camille " " four horsemen apocolypse " only because i never seen rudolph valentino film curious see what all fuss . now i know . i purchased " son sheik " , after seeing it several times , am captivated his charisma just like thousands before me through years . course , it bit corny several parts such fast motion they comical ; but , if accepted fantasy it , it truly beautiful , sexy romance . i've seen many reviews which his facial expressions thought comical ; but , most part , i mesmerized sexual tension came across those georgeos eyes ! when he first brings his dancing girl his camp lights his cigarette slowly takes off his belt while watching her over his shoulder smoldering stare , i actually felt fluttery would loved girl ! i not , personally , seen any male hear t-t hrob since valentino , present day , come even close rivaling his natural ability project such sensuality screen . raised eyebrow ! whew ! i now purchased " sheik " see where story all began . can't wait get carried away again	1
i must say i am taken aback many negative comments thrown this film . what many reviewers miss fact , aside western , this also story which duke plays opposite strong woman . there constant trading off two who upper hand -- duke not realizing just when he thinks he put ann-margaret her place she deceiving him toward her own purposes all . compared quiet american , mclintock , donovan reef , hatari true grit , this one film where duke doesn't exactly carry day over his female interest . therefore , it quite refreshing its own way . unlike other reviewers , i remember this film more fondly i others 1970's--including shootest . terms movie cowboys whom times passing ( duke terms which hollywood leaving him behind ) , i prefer remember aging john wayne this way . even outwitted one hell woman , john wayne more dignity himself than pretenders who followed . ( yes , i mean you , kevin costner . )	1
i've wanting this since show canceled . its just too bad there isn't anything past season	1
this great , sexy , mystery thriller really keeps you your toes . there no pointless panning dialogue leading up excitement film opens intense car chase . james spader keeps your attention fullest introverted former cop john parker his cool demeanor rye wit , keeping you guessing what hell going through his mind . spader you engrossed role so much you find yourself shoes john parker- getting away small mountain town , clearing your head painful divorce tragic loss partner , getting wrapped up steamy romantic affair , suddenly running aftermath bank robbery whole town shaken up . if approached wrong way , some dialogue scenarios may come accross somewhat corny , but it really modern action-mystery movie style 1940 black white mystery movie . even soundtrack gives it vibe black white picture . good own because you'll probably want view it multiple times .	1
i hated this movie . not one character redeeming quality . mom aging hippie denial who smokes pot boffs rock stars half her age . rock star self-centered self-important no talent . son playing kissy face impossibly beautiful co-worker . daughter-in-law playing kissy face rock star mom ! dialogue sounds written original music atrocious . only good thing i got out this discovery t-rex song i previously unaware .	-1
forget multitude indiscretions jfk may committed his sadly short life watch this film . it tells story cuban missile crisis 1962 . it isn't 100% accurate . kevin costners character never existed , although it may mixture number actual real-life people . however what it shows , some great performances , how close nuclear catastrophy we came 1962 . i only one time , so no personal recollection events , but if this film 50% true then we should all grateful jfk power not bush . jfk mostly lone voice government full hawks who advising him go all out nuclear first strike . jfk went behind their backs deal russians . course if you believe all out nuclear war sensible option then you hate this film . rest us though , this very well made film shows how great politician kennedy really	1
if you fan temps this dvd must . great footage , otis fantastic giving us look inside motown .	1
this honestly one worst films i ever witnessed ... gay or straight . i am amazed it actually got made , let alone distributed ! i hate mean , but it hard watch ms. lesnick . her talents must lay elsewhere . she not act her way out box . oy !! she should stuck her rabbinical studies . seriously folks .... you should just rent it see how bad it ... you fascinated . i am sure helen lesnick lovely hard working woman , but what flat actress . her heavy black blue makeup made her look like drag queen fact she says she 34 film insane ! she clearly looked 45 + . i am all accepting yourself you age , but woman such deep lines her face , she looked like road map . if you force us stare your face 2 hrs ( tons annoying close ups !! oy again ! )please consider boxtex next time . well she got film made out there , starring herself lead . i am sure great accomplishment her ... but , painful us .	-1
i watched this show when it new loved it . now i am 25 i love it even more , subtleties humor great degree lost children , but adult i get jokes many more levels . i see why my parents laughing so hard	1
apart colin firth intense portrayal main character , this movie really lacking any substance . times it seems like it makes sense there thin plot grasp , but then too slips away . most psychological thrillers , things not what they seem . there several twists plot , but most them happen last 20 minutes movie , ultimately viewer left completely confused , rather than shocked intrigued . colin firth character wakes up week-long coma after car accident which he believes his girlfriend died . he meets mena suvari , who helps him cope his " trauma " , some reason attracted him despite his erratic mannerisms strange habits . filmmaking also little strange quite few slow-motion-esque shots . i wish i knew better way describe them . strange shots where maybe filmmaker only showing every 5th frame , but slow motion . it distracting not very aesthetically pleasing . there , however , very creepy dream sequence middle film defintiely pays off . dvd no extras all , unless you count previews subtitles	-1

ppm generously allowed some their concerts filmed so pbs could use them fund raising . where i first saw this program i dvd because it gets behind concerts show us how trio got together , how they work together , why they so unique , what they meant history united states ( lot other places , like el salvador ) . their music consistently called americans live into ideals stated founding documents our country compassionate all who not privileges white middle class americans enjoy . i not only agree them , i am energized them reach those good things . this dvd treasured retrospective their career crusades , i can't think any follower ppm all generations they touched who would not love it	1

i could not sit through this movie . acting screenplay terrible . this film could described bad made-for-tv movie best . i ended up fast-forwarding though entire movie after first 30 minutes turned player off before i reached end . i couldn't take it anymore . this movie one worst i've attempted watch long time . not recommended .	-1

room full . almost everybody filled their white styrofoam cups black coffee taken their seats . when i finally got nerve stand i felt so self-conscious i wanted crawl under my chair . " my name charley deriemer , " i finally said , " ... i ... uh ... i'm fan ... uh ... frighteners . " but i'm disappointed lot it , too . this horror-comedy too much humor wit not enough cheese qualify cult flick . all film computer generated flatulence , me , eventually loses impact . cgf so clutters up story-line , which already complicated , i think peter jackson , director , must fallen love his computer toys forgotten there story tell . it doesn't help while most movie over-the-top funny , last part sinks into old-fashioned scare-um gore-fest without cleverness , just jake busey grinning lot teeth people jumping out big knives their hands . so why this movie so likable ? first , most time script funny clever . second , several sequences manage create great blend humor , raunchiness , special effects drama ( funeral cemetery , museum party egyptian wing ) or real jolt dread foreboding ( lucy mansion patricia ann , beginning psychiatric hospital scene ) . third , movie some fine , grotesque acting weird unsettling ( jeffrey coombs , dee wallace , jake busey ) or weird funny ( john astin , chi mcbride , peter dobson ) . fourth , you can't beat love story reaches beyond death into eternal devotion . patricia ( dee wallace ) johnny ( jake busey ) , love forever means never say you're sorry . fifth , my mind most importantly , it michael . fox frank bannister . fox personality star firepower able turn typical nice-guy character into man we really like . fox master portraying flawed , vulnerable nice guys we almost instantly sympathize . it rare talent . me , he manages most time overcome continual show-off intrusion all computer generated overkill . exception when he involved massive tube heaven looks like slinky steroids . when he screen , even when he enmeshed silly blue-screen aerobics , he makes film human grounded . it shame jackson all money all those computers play . he didn't really need them . just watch how he builds dread when lucy arrives creepy old mansion whisk patricia away safety . it one best , most skillful scenes movie , there hardly computer effect seen until last it ... when dread suspense swept out " wow " stuff swept . there lot great stuff this comedy serial killers , demonic possession scamming psychic investigator who brings his own ghosts . there lot frustrated , too . most part , i just use my fast-forward button now them . i like movie even its faults . now if only someone would make , " johnny patricia versus mommy daddy , " featuring knife-wielding mommy leather-suited daddy people under stairs . would make tag-team match worth watching . original , basic dvd 110-minute theatrical release . there director cut 122-minutes which probably brainchild production company marketing department , division double-dips development . dvd transfer looks just fine	1
freddy one most three easily recognized horror movie characters world . most people don't know names movies , but they know glove . just like , they don't know friday 13th , but they know hockey mask . 1984 , horror world set fire nmoes original . how .... well i don't really know . i think this movie much better than original , my favorite out series here why . first , script much better . first movie ton holes it , dialogue characters seemed akwardly structured . it like akward group date person your friends want you meet , except your watching it . you know characters should saying something but they aren't . big problem time script . nancy tells her dad come over her house twenty mintues . during those 20 mintues she manages set up numerous booby traps catch freddy , heart heart conversation her mom , still 10 minutes fall asleep . second movie , script feels natural . there some pretty funny parts script , dialogue characters seems real . i understand these movies aren't oscar worthy but still . best example when girl asks male lead why he doesn't use key start his car . she says " well , someone could steal your car , couldn't they ? " then he says " deadly dinosaur ? " just way they talk sounds real , it not normal cheesy horror movie line . second thing this movie better acting . nancy first movie down right horrible . it not she bad actor . she great job chase sequences acting scared . where she faulters way she says lines . they just feel so forced , like your watching middle school play . when she yells " kruger !! kruger !! come get me you ..... b****d " it just feels akward . even when she says something simple like " sc**w sleep , or s***w your hall pass !!! " it just doesn't work . they should girl who played tina play nancy , she would much better . second movie , male lead delivers . sure , some parts little over top but he really good job character . he teenage boy , who wants fit , but weak mind , perfect freddy take over . i thought it cool idea , not only could freddy attack you your dreams , he also take over your concious mind . i mean , why not ? it still mental right ? third thing this movie better editing effects . first one effects okay budget they , but often times it cuts away so fast you don't know what happened . or they show them too long effect lost . this one times it just right . it long enough gross you out , but short enough not lose effect it . plus they bigger budget , but i think first movie could lot better better editing . this isn't greatest horror movie ever , but i think it right up there . it definitely my favorite out series . some people say it filled homosexual references things , but i never got out it . i thought it good twist original movie , made very well . you think what you want , but first movie me , doesn't get it . it too many holes gaps effective .	1

this movie made 1963 , if anyone tries judge movies 1963 todays standards they typically think movie boring slow moving . movie based true story , there book you read if you want more detail . you probably more great actors ( james garner , charles bronsan , mcqueen , attenborough , coburn , etc ) this one movie than you combined all hollywood today . today all special effects , blood guts more brutality better . imagine any movie today no cursing , would not get past screening room . listen richard attenborough classify all germans one enemy , not differentiate ss gestapo . we war all them , not just ss . teenagers drive todays movie market there few movies which keep their attention if there no special efects . this movie adult movie , plain simple . motorcycle scene awesome . i think steve mcqueen most it . richard attenborough one tough guy movie , you not steroid pumped up tough , you tough your mind . music score great , scenery great , actors great it entertaining movie . i really tried tell i enjoyed this movie it good movie . remember this movie made only 16 or so years after wwii	1
many other reviewers previously stated , full b.s they assail it . its hard criticize them , because sometimes they're spot correct , many their arguments hold water . too often , it simply comes down penn making fun people using forced amounts profanity prove they're wrong . occasionally , they use mythbuster-like tactics , but rarely . someone who hates michael moore , penn jilette seemes adopt many his methods " i'm right , they're wrong " ideology . one episode devoted cryptozoology more attack zoology general . zoology student , i took offense this . jilette referred new species animals " stupid " basically implying zoological research worthless boring . guy who avowed athiest skeptic who trumps science over religion superstition , penn only served remind me , also athiest skeptic , how annoying passionless overly pessimistic skeptic people around after while	-1

it important director immediately establish level trust his/her audience . we need believe we capable hands introduce us characters situations make perfect sense , events follow one unyielding logic . first , i felt decision made early film decision outside " trust " i described above . toward end film , i realized decision ok - even though i thought it bad idea filmmaker part make particular decision . i wish screenwriters worked harder come up different way get point point . problem " real " decision i lost faith director/story almost immediately because it appeared - time - utterly ridiculous . there scene where cat came jumping out closet shock value , my lord , i can't count number times where tired old trick used . whenever happens , i immediately think someone lazy can't come up better way give audience quick scare . besides - it quite awful leave cat locked up closet because they tend start using it their bathroom , you just can't get cat pee out * anything * . movie progressed , it began move fairly reasonable logic flow , i started gain trust director/story again , even though there some unnecessary characters scenes . dakota fanning ( emily ) , amazing actress whose ability portray wide range emotions many actors actresses years more training experience would give their left foot , perfect character part . we see her happy , we see her completely dead inside , we see her unbearably terrified . her tremors tears terrors ring true . she best actor film . ( which saying quite bit . ) movie man whose wife dies he moves country help his daughter cope . this didn't make sense me , because psychologist , father , david , ( deniro ) , should known just plain stupid . we don't see many emotions deniro after his wife dies , too disturbed me . again - i didn't feel capable hands , so i questioned everything looked wrong . while beautiful house country , emily what everyone calls imaginary friend - charlie . david frustrated this , few conversations former student his close emily . that where story starts pick up . charlie more more part emily life , david feels isolated . end , it seemed movie going " sixth sense " feel , it almost achieved it , but fell short . we're shown obligatory flashbacks , but they aren't convincing , shocking , or immediately understood those occurred shyamalan film . ( i saw " sixth sense " theater its opening weekend . i'm hard hearing , i wear headsets , thankfully , drown out idiots who like talk through films . however , those headsets couldn't keep me hearing shocked gasps audience . it shame shyamalan trying recreate same shock rest his films , because he failed miserably . ) if " hide seek " wasn't incorporating elemental template " sixth sense " , it would made more interesting film . or if " sixth sense " never made , it might more interesting . but i don't think it would much more interesting , because i said , flashbacks shocks those flashbacks supposed cause fell short . case point : " sixth sense " rating 8.2 imdb.pro, hide seek rating 5.5 . i tend trust those ratings , because members imdb.pro film aficionados , thousands people ( 129,000 ss 13,600 ) cast votes . it good sample .	-1

or not not one more well-known mel brooks films , but rip-roaring slightly naughty fun . it sets itself apart other mel brooks films superb , well- structured plot even some serious social commentary . mel plays lead role opposite stunning anne bancroft , his real-life wife . their personalities add real acting chemistry film . charles durning got academy award nomination best supporting actor his role gestapo commander . i really like " naughty nazis " number - hysterical	1
it worth attention ? definitely . it worth money ? absolutely . it worth effort ? certainly . it worth two years ? probably . it worth wait ? not really . it deserve last effort great late director ? unquestionably . plot eyes wide shut unfolds , tom cruise nicole kidman struggle attract audience attention . they attentively invite viewer into their fantasy world , which dreams might reality reality one single night becomes long unforgettable dream . good actor tom cruise this movie , nicole kidman manages steal show him . scene during which she reveals her husband how she would easily given up everything : him , her daughter , her life naval officer powerful combo her performances critically acclaimed die broadway play blue room . only flawed scene kidman alice , ex-gallery manager , who currently unemployed , sequence where she tells her husband she terrible nightmare . her sobs unemotional scene it not come out strong rest her performance . famously feared orgy scene indeed peculiar . it captures viewer attention , but it really needed ? scene serves little purpose conveying true message thin line imaginary real life . entire scenery inside rich mansion , where orgy scenes take place , where masked men pray hookers , fantastic regardless controversy its necessity . stanley kubrick , master filmmaking , gives imaginary twist marriage , dreams , reality life . but once viewer exits theater , he or she loss words thin line dream world reality disappears . such effect indeed kubrick last legacy .	1

clint eastwood looking cross television films but no success . until italian director , sergio leone decided bring western italy . leone decided liberally steal great kurosawa films . this much like yojimbo original zatoichi . eastwood plays gun hire , man no name . he stumbles into corrupt town . town controlled two rival families . he proves his abilities but when both sides vie his services , he accepts both offers pits two families against each other . this film created persona eastwood would follow him next two decades . dvd extras : none	1

good premise story line , most part decent dialog , outstanding acting ( except sleepwalking gyllenhaal ) , so what missing ? what missing plausibility . movie grief doesn't dwell it , but it must show early grief there . if this properly , viewer accept even most outlandish behavior character way dealing grief . kasdan it brilliantly ' big chill , ' mere thirty seconds glenn close sobbing shower . silbering failed anything like `moonlight mile , ' so eccentric parents goofy fiance seem uncaring preoccupied only themselves . i couldn't overcome it , even though i tried good while . time gyllenhaal bares his soul court it way too late ; what might otherwise quite affecting seems only outlandish .	-1

this televised ( pbs ) gala turned me casual , occasional opera listener into full-fledged fan . most specifically , it introduced me beauty splendor wagner . i recorded gala video , watched it time time over years . while pal version referred reviewer may contained entire performance , this dvd not . it comes awfully close , though . there missing arias which performed evening alfredo kraus ( werther aria ) , gwyneth jones ( " questa reggia " ) , vladimir chernov ( figaro aria barber seville ) , others -- most notably , wonderful " va pensiero " performed incomparable met chorus , cherubino aria wonderful fredrica von stade ( much better than selection included here her ) . but when you still close 5 hours glorious music like this , these complaints minor . this neophyte opera listener , i knew wagner composer rousing music used " apocalypse now " . i not prepared astonishing beauty prelude " rienzi " , which opens gala , nor could i believe intensity waltraud meier performance isolde " narrative curse " " tristan und isolde " . but it james morris ' performance " wotan farewell " which moved me near tears , which , noted earlier , turned me into devoted fan this music . there many other wonderful moments this dvd ( personal favorite : roberto alagna bryn terfel duet bizet " pearlfishers " ) . you probably won't watch this one sitting , but each performace , you thoroughly won over met orchestra . incredibly , unlike met centennial gala , which used many conductors , entire james levine 25th anniversary gala conducted maestro levine . may he grace pit metropolitan opera many years come . needless say , i couldn't recommend dvd release any more highly	1

there comes time when you exposed film ... song ... photograph ... piece history sends you place where you either want ... or wish avoid . i saved film " aria " father day ... because when i began watch it six months ago i quickly enveloped aura nostalgia tugged my heart . i don't know how review such film " aria " . there never anything like it , nor there again . it cinematic brilliance ... cinematic brilliance ... cinematic brilliance . you get point ? it visual masterpiece ... musical masterpiece ... simply piece art ! i'd remiss if i told you it everyone . this one very much romantic ( sometimes erotic ) flick i would highly recommend hopeless romantics this planet . unfortunately , eliminates most men earth ... but not me . i don't remember last time i cried so much ... so hard ... so consistently ... than this operatic , eroti ,. connectic , endearing ... sometimes tragic epic . it filled love ... pain ... hope ... joy ... sprinkled passion ... eternal love ... lost dreams ... hopeful fantasies ... art ! many films left me speechless ... this one never find way keep my trap shut . maybe it romance me provoked tears ... but this film one goes straight heart ... soul ... ears tears . if you've ever love ... lost love ... yearned love ... or simply enjoyed thought love ... " aria " you . see it loving friend . i swear you'll swap tissues ... you'll hug ... you'll cry out loud ... that what makes this film such epic heart . what wrong tears ? what wrong wanting ... ... losing ... possessing strength eternal love passion ? isn't what life all ? all this captured without script . soul orchestrated operatic classics . it profound sound ... visual candy only cinematic artist could capture film . this one made pr ... me . it go down one finest films i ever seen . only one hint ... it series vignettes build intensity . star-studded cast includes many classic actors actresses ... but their challenge this ditty capture your heart without script . guess what ? they . here box . go out ... rent or buy this box ... some kleenex ... bottle chardonnay ... hold hand someone you love . i , regretably , home alone ... when i let stan ( my dog ) house after film ... he never received better back rub ( scratch behind ears ) . i'm still lost " aria " . tranquil mood ... imagery ... beautiful music live me forever . phew ! this one simply awesome !	1
i should known what expect " extreme " marketing phrases all over cover ... raw brutal , yeah right . i fully understand not wanting put out super produced dvd ( though i enjoy ones released their peers ) but these bootlegs horrible . sound too distorted ( not distorted guitars)in live footage ; even some music videos quality shotty best ( which inexcusable this era technology ) . if you want sound preserves more , pardon this word , " raw " feeling take cue bad religion " way " dvd . it soundboard , but that it . there lot comparisons " cliff ' em all " but come . tribute band member who passed away , bootlegs only choice . even so , it funny how bootlegs 1980 sound just good , sometimes better than , sound here . humor let down . all lyrics inner struggle self improvement one would expect something more than scenes puking someone window . , what , four minute clip other musicians saying shadows fall suck gay ? i teach 9th grade , i think even they would feel this humor too childish . i would only reccomend this dvd those who collect shadows fall . those us who like music would better off just listening albums . long live image attitude over substance	-1

i found this valuable collection my dance library . first segment teaches what many instructors fail teach- orientation smooth transitions early , this video guide you easily . transitions left right created teaching pivoting foot almost magically , creating smooth graceful dancing , no more boring dancer , learn dance all your audience , not just those facing you ! cross step use arms over head framing head , taxsim which much overlooked , hip pushes , beautiful traveling hip circles , undulations . second segment teaches funtastical drum solo , easy learn . it easy add this choreography make it more challenging . there so much this video , learn flow gracefully or bump beat drum , let beautiful neon guide you into spellbinding journey this mystical dance . overall , i totally enjoyed quality this video only improvements i would make would backdrop or setting which needed color . learning video easier my opinion if instructor faces mirror or works angle student follows . overall those minor compared all offered	1
ferrell crew really firing all cylinders here . anchorman funny bursts spurts , same old school , but this one keeps up fevered comedic pace up checkered flag . it makes fun french , jazz music , friends dorothy , but also makes fun nascar , rednecks , kfc , taco bell , applebee , but such way even people or things spoofed would enjoy this movie . dennis miller not funny long time , i remember he tried make joke dixie chicks , how their criticism war wouldn't go over nascar dads . but hey , dennis your agememnon references ruined monday night football those same nascar dads , you never go over them . ferrell go over them , even he parodies them , they love him , he slip some steve earle into soundtrack , it sound redneck but actually very subversive . ferrell totally get away all it . i watched this movie christmas my dad , he loved it , my nephew also received copy it christmas , he liked it too . there very touching father/son back story , it appeals all ages socio-economic backgrounds . i just realized french driver played guy who made borat . i hear he funny movie , too . let all get thrown out applebee's!!!	1
i've hoping release this series long time now , anxiously look forward other seasons , lot entertainment price	1
this pretty cute funny , really if i could i would given it 3.5 stars , but there not half star rating here . all all , it well put together .. vein fun old scooby doo cartoons i grew up . various worlds they visited during adventure added story kept you getting bored one scenario . i freely admit , i am more partial older ones .. they just seem little more solid me than current ones , but overall i think this good kids watch , they would fun it learn few things way .	1

there much concern this series would never see light day . fox restored these films cable tv eye towards video release . however , when films first ran cable , there storm protest asian groups . they protested fact charlie chan not portrayed chinese actor ( although other chan family members played asians)and some his mannerisms might viewed stereotypical . defense these films , charlie chan always good guy he always outsmarted his opponents . films must viewed context era which they produced . they good clean fun . no bloody violence screen ! i am happy fox courage release these films dvd . interest them extraordinary . first two volumes moved top amazon sales charts within few days release . hopefully , all fox chans come dvd near future .	1
if you choosing which volumes keep , this one falls under must category , although second episode , " return babel " clearly stronger one . episode , we get return mark lenard spock father , reincarnation his previous role season one romulan commander who meets his doom pitting his wits against capt kirk . this time , lenard shows more staying power his new role ambassador sarek endure years come even through st : tos movies . what makes this episode very good also great acting newly departed jane wyatt who puts very heart-wrenching emotional performance her role spock human mother . plot also very good fast moving well making this overall one best episodes entire trekdom let alone second season must your collection . first episode isn't classic but it still some good points which includes surprise revelation end lt . uhura no less figuring something out combined grey matter kirk , spock bones failed which impressive . plot fast-moving premise interesting scottie gets hero change . overall , this solid volume 2 powerful episodes strength " return babel " must any tos collection . highly recommended	1
" professionals " last era westerns . it intelligent well written script , well directed richard brooks . what cast burt lancaster lee marvin both excellent aging mercenaries out one last mission . great supporting cast . my only regret i wish woody stode would little more role . unlike other films time genre characters honest heros , not antiheros . these honorable men doing tough dangerous job	1
ok , so i'll admit brad pitt accent not perfect there no way any ira man would pretty ( imagine if brad pitt looked like gerry adams - i doubt he would get many roles ) . but accent actually not bad , belfast people actually say " foks sake " quite frequently . i agree there some dubious moments plot action scenes little far fetched , but hey , this hollywood , there enough " gritty realism " feel imparted elsewhere distract viewer these minor inconsistencies . harrison ford plays same character he played patriot games / air force 1 / fugitive , which fine me since i enjoyed all those movies i am big harrison fan . i didn't find plot partucularly confusing ( it pretty straightforward really ) . although i certainly wouldn't venture say script delivers chapter verse hellishly complicated political situation . ireland , it least go some way explaining mechanisms ( personal revenge , indoctrination ) drive cycle violence there . bittersweet ending desired effect .	1
i loved this movie ! it wasn't scary i hoped but other than it fabulous ! lisa brenner gorgeous she shines ellen rimbaur ! it great prequel " rose red " , which also fantastic .	1

made pittance , initially released just two theaters , ultimately grossing over ten million dollars , " sweet sweetback baadasssss song " became progenitor " blaxploitation " film craze seventies . considered seminal film african-american cinema , director van peebles feels it influenced independent film movement whole . its jazzy editing strong hero set it miles apart standard fare - one see how african-american audiences could see this film long-overdue cinematic thunderbol t.t he plot simple . sweetback ( van peebles himself ) grown up bordello become one its central attractions . one night , he agrees accompany pair police officers downtown questioning . murder case lacks suspects , gesture appears compensation force lenience toward establishment . en route interrogation , however , police intercept youth street brutally beat him . using his handcuffs , sweetback kills both officers . rest protracted chase , sweetback using his fists ( among other body parts ) make his way border . police question his companions , hot his trail guns , bloodhounds ( one point ) helicopter . van peebles eye striking shot , there some vivid scenes police officers brutalizing sweetback friend beetle get their point across . while its historic contribution clear , " sweetback " little offer modern audiences beyond its kitsch value . van peebles strong presence laconic hero , but there not much way narrative or memorable characters savor . there plenty sex violence ( ' ' rating fully earned ) , but it episodic - much film seems enormous montage repeated street scenes dialogue clips , effect rapidly becomes tiresome . thirty years after its explosive release , " sweetback " remain compelling film historians students . its torch passed other filmmakers , but pioneering effort itself not dated well . ps - dvd release interview director . initially , it shares some formal similarities feature , but later it settles into some interesting ( amusing ) anecdotes . pps - i just saw " badasssss !

i am watching too many these italian movies . i am starting recognize people other movies familiar names actors/music/special effects other movies . i really should stop watching them because i really don't like them very much . i am more interested gore comedy these gore movies without humor " dead alive " or " terror firmer " tend bore me . this movie more straight gore fan . there someone stealing body parts hospital . there mad doctor taking off skull caps changing brains . there cannibalism . there machete stuck someone head self-defense . my favorite one main character using boat prop scramble zombie face . i wish there more things like this i might enjoyed it more . it poorly however . what i heard this popular cult favorite this type movie however makers seem made it without much inspiration besides making money . i really enjoy special features these types movies ( which i guess one big reason i continue watching these types italian gore movies i don't really like ) . i enjoy stories behind movies , etc . this one interview special effects person who i recognize zombi 2 bonus features ( i think it there ? ) . i am pretty sure interviews this zombi 2 same setting . it seemed me this probably right after interview zombi 2 . this one he seemed annoyed repeated questions zombi 2 interview . his attitude annoyed " i said before ...

this amazing quot ; behind musicquot ; dvd treasure chieftains fans , fans irish music , or fans great music general . their humor , candor willingness press limits their music not only makes this cd great viewing , but also helps explain their endless longevity . it lump-in-the-throat listen derek bell , recently departed , speculate he perhaps 20 more years live ( gone much too soon -- rest peace , dear friend ) . i can't recommend this wonderful dvd highly enough	1

this worst movie i've ever seen . i hardly ever write reviews , but i feel failing review this would like leaving spoiled milk refrigerator next poor fellow discover . that what this review , signpost warning my fellow man not see this movie . trust me . characters all horribly unlikeable , right get-go . here plot summary : because main character refuses open her mail , she evicted her house . she then , instead waiting our nation fine legal system fight through red tape get her house back , harasses house new owners , affair cop who no given motivation leaving his wife children . blah blah blah she gets drunk , takes owners hostage , befriends owners then takes bunch prescription meds . cop comes , blah blah blah family son gets shot , so parents kill themselves . lady who won't open her mail gets her house back . while i briefly considered getting drunk taking lots prescription meds after seeing this horribly depressing movie , i decided positively channel my negative energy into erecting this digital signpost , warning all mankind stay away this abomination film . zero star	-1
i love classic album series . they give you such great insight how band created their masterpieces . this time we given pleasure getting into queen classic album usual there some great interviews band members , producers , famous fans , record executives . i don't think this best classic album dvd but it still very good . you would expect , brian may gives most interesting information regarding making this album he also shows how he plays some sections . i little disappointed lack info given famed producer roy thomas baker . it would great hear freddie thoughts this album but hey , you can't everything . overall this definitely worth buying if you're into classic albums or queen . other great titles this series include deep purple machine head def leppard hysteria	1

" santa waiting , santa greeting , now you're nodding , now you're sleeping , you good mom dad , santa knows if you've bad ! " you won't able help but sing this fitting christmas song after watching this flick . dvd anchor bay put together pretty good . i'm only rating this first film mind . i haven't watched second one yet , but if i remember correctly what people said , half movie flashbacks . not good . avoid other 3 sequels well some not even related first . however , first film really creepy music , clear picture dvd transfer , several good moments enjoy . beginning where they visit grandfather creepy when he starts ranting how santa punishes bad children christmas eve . then billy parents killed robber santa suit same night . fast forward four years billy living orphanage strict , iron-handed mother superior who believes punishment necessary bad children ! fast forward ten years billy 18 working department store over christmas . after seeing fellow co-worker harrassed back room while flashbacks all horror he experienced when he younger , he finally snaps begins killing spree punish all bad ( including one antlers deer head hung wall ! ) holiday-themed film , i thought this pretty good . my favorite black christmas one much better far , but this one worth any true horror fans collection . even if it just all controversy it caused when it first released 1984 because they idea killer santa suit too much some people grasp . while i agree kids don't need see commerical advertisements posters suggest santa dangerous , this movie pure adult entertainment . kids go summer camp trick or treating , but i didn't see people complaining friday 13th or halloween films when those came out . silent night deadly night should not singled out because . parents simply don't need their kids watching this , end story . that why it rated . just reminder all parents santa not real ! we let kids believe he real mere fun it . isn't just bad ? check this one out horror fans	1
jacob kornbluth written directed this explosive little film such finesse multiple messages life ghetto , power need family , introspective view children caught fault lines life , incomprehensible difficulties mere survival world chaos all delivered conviction power . this very fine little indie film deserves wide audience . zaidmans family five living tenement building new york city area where streets ghetto tenements house myriad people lives one struggle . mother sue ( mary-louise parker ) sole financial supporter since her husband paul ( david warshofsky ) stroke victim leaving him wheelchair bound brain damaged . not even her visiting mother ( lois smith ) tolerate sue volatile temperament unable stay offer relief . izzy ( michael silverman ) active child while his brother sam ( jonah bobo ) sister amy ( chelsea harkins ) seem not mind confined their apartment , watching tv their disabled father . sue best friend ruth ( audra mcdonald ) her only contact sanity this household not only drains her time when she not working support family , but presents her husband who nearly vegetative her child izzy who needs 24 hour monitoring ! izzy cannot resign himself bleak future what his home represents so spends his time braking into people apartments just relief it , doing little damage but breaking entering purpose showing absent owners he some degree power over them . times he takes his best friend robbie ( jelani jeffries ) order proof rapster kids street he powerful . once his reputation established he taunts colleagues some ventures ends up purse snatching crime spree . one point izzy , friends tow witnesses , breaks into apartment he thinks deserted only discovered young couple who throes sex . couple listens izzy pleas mercy stories why he there , yet izzy taken police station where his mother comes obtain his release . izzy promises change sue desperation , only supported her friend ruth , comes close breakdown seemingly insurmountable obstacles her life . just when izzy finally makes some verbal contact his father , further realizing his hopeless future , he goes break-in outing starts fire his own building . this creates momentum finale story , one which little said words but much resolved eye contact body language : ending must saved impact it holds . mary-louise parker once again shows her ability create characters who not only touch but grab our hearts . michael silverman fine little child actor ( bobo , hawkins , jeffries ) manages keep his character within bounds credibility - no mean trick role it written . supporting cast likewise top caliber . only criticism sound system : kids doing rap even just ' talking talk ' simply unintelligible , so much izzy interaction his ' gang ' lost messy mixing . best thief world solid piece work , not easy watch because content , but very powerful little drama represents only drop ink megapolis new york ( read world ) . grady harp , april 05	1
unfortunately this happens time time again : mexican filmmakers hook you interesting premise , but then they don ; know where go it . acting good ( federico luppi , argeninian mel gibson he takes severe beating every one his films ) , but we reach end film , we left hanging without conclusion . art ? no ; fart . rent it if you feel like wasting few hours	-1
we should start making one thing clear : films zalman king no basis reality whatsoever ; they're erotic fantasies , pure simple . how else explain his casting choices leading roles his films : carrie otis , sherilyn fenn , david duchovony , richard tyson , bridgette bako , etc . people real life seldom sex appeal above-mentioned names . then there stories cloak these fine specimens , which almost always involve young innocent woman led down road sexual discovery , usually domineering though charming man , who she secretly lusted after sometime . what king films lack dramatic verve , they make up hitting their intended target : your libido . critics pounced like never before his feature film adaptation anais ninn erotic classic , ' delta venus . ' but they clearly missed point , ' delta venus ' isn't so much feature film , it most epic , most visually beautiful episode king 90s showtime series , ' red shoe diaries . ' context , it succeeds its fairly modest goals . set 1940s paris , ' venus ' introduces us aspiring writer named elena ( audie england ) . what appears morning ritual , she rushes banks sienne bitter january cold , muted urgency , one thing : watch handsome lawrence ( costas mandylor) -- man she yet meet --- row through foggy river . it isn't too long before she meets lawrence party thrown her agent , marcel ( eric da silva ) , discovers lawrence also writer , thriving , if controversial career . he , fact , leave france american tour support his latest effort --- but not before whirlwind affair elena , which far more profound effect her than she could ever imagined . lawrence gone , no money , no luck getting her stories published , elena crew friends --- artist , singer , their same-sex lovers --- suggest elena model nude cash . but marcel got more lucrative idea : she could write explict sex stories nameless collector erotica , who'll pay her handsomely it . ulitmately , elena accepts both offers , when collector , through marcel , insists graphic realism her stories , she ups ante her own sex life , fullfilling her desperate " desire plunge into living " " capable many loves . " audie england performance elena unfairly panned . she isn't great actress , but she just right mix doe-eyed innocence , restless intelligence , raw sensuality bubbling just beneath surface make her believeable . her initial scenes mandylor mildly touching , we see her teeter school-girl crush burning womanly desire . if nothing else , she least marked improvement over woozy carrie otis ' wild orchid . ' take how you may . costas mandylor really isn't this movie much , but he makes most what there . two chemistry , without which ' delta venus ' would really terrible critics said . granted , king doesn't always hit mark ' delta'--a sequence set party st. tropez particularly irritating his reach themes seem overextend his grasp . there definitely points which dialogue seem strain capture nin prose . critics also complained this film simply doesn't reflect reality life 1940s france . ( ugh . ) but counter , go back top this review read first sentence again . you really expecting zalman king give you blow-by-blow hitler invasion france ? if you're going this simply watch interesting love story -- turned beautiful cinematography , gorgeous actors , atmospheric lushness -- you not disappointed . fans tv show ' lost ' fans get kick out cameo made adewale akinnoyue-agbaje mysterious clairvoyant who gives ... special reading redheaded prostitute	1
don't get thrown first two reviews amazon posted this page . this dvd authorized release quality fantastic	1
kal penn cool i dig some his work , but this film very weak . i dig ta element , but storyline lack humor bored me . it only just ok best . i expected little something would crack me up . i knew it gonna just kinda there , but it didn't even really go anything but just ok	-1
those turning this film answer all questions last two episodes evangelion ( nge ) series didn't answer , i suggest you look elsewhere . if anything , this film provide you precious few answers but multitude new questions . those wanting highly provocative , thought-provoking , intelligent most poignant conclusion nge series , then no fear . i try explain some more perplexing elements this film , without giving too much away , well giving my thoughts opinions same time . film structured final two episodes series . so first half , ep . 25 " air/love destructive " concurrent series episode 25 " world ending/do you love me ? " . second half , ep . 26 . " my purest heart you/one more final : i need you " concurrent series episode 26 " beast shouted love heart world/take care yourself . " much like nge series , end evangelion ( eoe ) weaves complex story where images dialogue closely related philosophy symbolism . these themes played out through psychology each characters ' own mind . it essentially microcosm entire series . opening scenes before " air " title card ep . 25 shinji overlooking ruins city , then entering asuka hospital room , ( i'll leave it there ) set mood atmosphere . showing effectively very disturbingly this not going easy film . first half roars out gates breakneck speed , we see hostile takeover nerv seele organization each nerv member desperate attempt hold it bay . we also see mental states two main eva pilots - shinji asuka - reduced too . shinji severely depressed after killing last angel , kaworu , whom he formed close bond . asuka same mental boat shinji she sits bottom lake her eva , which she feels she can't pilot anymore . what interesting paths driven these two characters this point . ideas finding one self-worth ( examined perfectly final two series episodes ) , what happens person when taken away . same time seele trying initiate their plans third impact using unit-01 downright creepy looking mass-produced eva series , gendo his own plans involving rei lilith . asuka , ( little help inspiration her mama ) rages extremely violent battle evil evas , gendo takes rei down lilith . he this unite souls bodies adam lilith only find his scorned lover , ritsuko there . it interesting two most shocking violent scenes ( asuka/eva battle gendo/ritsuko confrontation ) played out bach beautiful " air " . infusion music this film truly brilliant major reason why many scenes so effective . however , this point film where most people start become completely lost . without really good understanding nge story ( perhaps even one ) , it hard not . it very difficult make extremely complex simple , however i'll try without many spoilers . suffice it say seele trying initiate third impact reduce humankind back its original form - primordial soup life where all souls beings one . gendo different plans just wanted see his ' dead ' wife , yui again . neither seele or gendo plans go exactly they meant . unit-01 , shinji , ends up becoming tree life , ark which all souls ushered through into lilith egg . understanding idea nge , humans - lilim , we're called - born lilith , rei essentially lilith helps make this clearer . what happening near this point 3rd impact occurring because unit-01 mass produced eva encounter . this returns geo-front ( sphere like cavern where nerv hq sits ) its original form , egg lilith ( we see this during " eye " -like explosion ) . after giant rei/lilith forms , shinji essentially given reign over future human race rei/lilith herself . this point , tempo film slows crawl most surreal images scenes begin creeping . even most seemingly simple scenes such young shinji playing sandbox swing , mountains , setting sun background just rife symbolism ( hint : try relate everything this scene something show , it scenes , characters , or themes ) . here , psychological interplay main characters crucial , shinji wishes played out real world . when he feels everyone deserted him essentially says ' everyone just die ' when instrumentality joining all souls through lilith really begins . what important note shinji thoughts after his ' choice ' made . place he escapes - world instrumentality where all souls one - his questioning this choice all his choices what we see here . more than just his questioning choice , we also hear him questioning meaning reality dreams . this not just random philosophical ramblings . it study character , well creator , thoughts feelings . shinji holds all humanity future his hands or , more accurately , his own mind . when you consider how psychologically scarred shinji , idea he completely shape future earth all humankind what makes this so interesting . once he allowed world he escapes , he faced choice whether stay or come back . he discusses these things rei kaworu ( lilith adam ) , we hear his final choice reasons why . ending eoe , titled " one more final : i need you " rightfully confusing almost everyone who sees it . however , it also perfect note end series . not only it leave us uncertain characters future , but it also expresses frustration realization shinji choice culmination all struggles lead them there . this film simply divine marvel . much like series it watched multiple times one uncover all its hidden layers meanings . but it doesn't lose its ability invoke emotions thoughts even after several viewings . there scenes immense power drama film - many match best most films i've seen . but i think it quiet moments make this film so moving memorable . sandbox scene one i've mentioned . live action shots monologue bach magnificent " jesus bleibet meine freude " ( jesus , joy man desiring ) playing piano it . even more subtle moments , such shinji sdat ( walkman type ) player out batteries ( more significant than many would think ) , gendo broken glasses rei place . vivid beginning instrumentality played out appropriate sad-song-with-a-pop-beat " komm susser tod " ( come sweet death ) , it these scenes never fail give me chills . there great quote goes something like " truly wise man always more questions than answers . " this series film asks more questions than it provides answers . what it tries make you think those questions , rather than provide easily digestible story . some may call story incoherent disjointed , but what many don't realize deep psychological philosophical leanings behind show inextricably linked storyline itself . so distinguish one other impossible without realizing how two intertwine effect other . if you merely try breakdown sci-fi storyline , then you confused much it . this because story so big so encompassing many finer details can't uncovered without diving deep into inner workings series . end , i only speak myself when i say nge superlative job doing everything great work art should . it made me laugh , it made me cry , it gave me chills more than one occasion .... but most all it made me think . anyone who wants enjoy this show just meaningless work science fiction so , but baffled they're crushed multiple layers extra contextual meanings . so , if you want understand nge , you not only pay close attention small details within show ( small scenes many episodes back play role film ) , you really open your mind up ideas presented , how they effect story . however , taken film , conclusion nge series , end evangelion staggering achievement powerful last testament what , my opinion , greatest visual series all time . * dvd notes : those considering whether buy just eoe or eoe/death rebirth 2-pack , i suggest you go eoe unless you don't own director cuts last several episodes ( available platinum collection ) . ' death ' mostly muddled re-crap entire series , while ' rebirth ' merely first 30 minutes eoe . death also doesn't contain remastered visuals or audio like platinum collection , so you'll getting low quality re-cap . death really doesn't even work introduction nge , because most everyone not aquainted previous episodes would confused structure recap . only thing worthwile ' death ' something called " magi archives " which provides great information key people , places , events , thing series . this very helpful those who feel completely lost all jargon series help clear some things up , even if it won't answer any bigger questions . so just stick eoe unless you feel need completeness get death rebirth well	1

first off , julia roberts me actress who become more beautiful age even this day . said , i anxious see this movie because her cameron diaz . i seen my best friend wedding three times i must admit i viewed it differently each time i've seen it . what i mean this i never really able decide which woman groom should end up ; his bride-to-be or his best friend . granted , julia every rotten thing she this film break up her best friend wedding so viewpoint i favored him ending up cameron . other hand one reviewer put it , julia her best friend more chemistry than groom his bride-to-be so viewpoint i also favored him ending up julia . during film , there times when i rooted julia get her man despite her despicable efforts win him over yet other times i wanted cameron end up groom . this movie still entertains me even after knowing outcome . aside simple plot breaking up wedding , this film good humor , good acting , decent soundtrack , overall believable chick flick most part . even guys like myself should find it entertaining i am normally picky when it comes chick flicks . special edition dvd worth picking up if you haven't seen features . one featurettes shows original alternative ending which much different how film originally ended . which two endings better ? only viewer decide . me , i'm not telling . anyway , bonus features overall good plentiful . only problem camera focus one featurettes somewhat off distorts picture bit . nothing too serious but very noticable . i suppose sequel this movie would interesting but then who knows how well it would turn out	1

this one my all time favourites ! paul verhoeven his best here ! this movie could easily turned out into smooth hollywood production , but verhoeven managed squeeze lot his dark sense humor somehow . this adding real extra dimension movie . movie situated possible future detroit where police privately owned (!) company called ocp . ocp now plan call halt crime : robocop project . all they now need " volunteer " . peter weller brilliantly cast robocop he basically talks like robot nature already . however kurtwood smith delivers best performance here . his role psychotic gangleader clarence boddicker really rocks ! go watch thisas this movie proves , action movies not necessarilyhave stupid .

i loved natural when it came out 1984 . mythical quality story , terrific acting perfect cast , great editing , great direction made this film one my all time favorite sports movies . so this year new dvd version released called director cut . apparently there 20 minutes new footage added , but editing results film only 6 minutes longer than original . chief difference two versions backstory relayed primarily through flashback " present " , roy hobbs returns his childhood home after 16 years away . he retrieves " wonder boy " , then goes new york start his career ny knights . new version works okay , but i frankly preferred original . i preferred its slightly more deliberate pacing , i don't think new scenes ( primarily extended versions already existing scenes ) added any real value or perspective . indeed , one scene which memo travels meet roy road actually detracted cohesion story . bottom line : if you loved original , you'll like this one . it still basically same film . i just don't think it needed any tinkering	1

wiktor grodecki brave filmmaker , one who unafraid address controversial subject , yet one who able make powerful sociologic statement creating metaphorical art film demands respect . grodecki interviews young boys ( ages 14 - 17 ) who male hustlers prague : he wisely removes ( most part ) interviewer questions allowing individual boys make spontaneous , searing comments . these young lads discuss why they became male prostitutes , how they deal selling their bodies , where they find their business ( train station , swimming pools , etc ) , how they feel johns their fellow hustlers , manner which they business including way which financial aspects come play - all way burns faces these young lads into our psyches . half way through this film grodecki introduces pavel rousek , man who day pathologist performing autopsies prague morgue his off hours ( using pseudonym hans miller ) creates , casts directs gay porno videos his home . rousek shown autopsy table gowning , gloving , grotesquely performing autopsy real cadaver while discussing both professions . there moments while he gloving he explains why he doesn't allow his boys wear condoms ( buyers his videos don't want see condoms ) , contrast his self protection vs enforcement prevention sexual protection his actors devastating . rousek miller then shown filming boys his home , explaining details achieving visual effects pornography : simultaneously we again hear boys views aspect their ' careers ' , creating pitiful tension . there almost no total nudity this film when it occur lighting so dark obscure it - making overall effect even more dense effectively tense . under all this lurid talk grodecki uses classical music - albinoni , mahler , mozart - which again provides contradiction makes topic digestible . final question grodecki poses his subjects involves boys perception ' soul ' while there variety responses , overall message these lads sell their bodies career , but soul ' what you think ' , something cannot taken you . several these boys screen presence faces , they noticed regular film makers , would probably give them legitimate careers . but power film comes words these boys , knowing completely their choice life , therein lies sorrow . this tough but very fine piece filmmaking . interestingly , grodecki absorbed this material used it create his subsequent feature film mandragora ( reviewed under title ) . this film more powerful two . not movie everyone , but certainly important document way life few know fewer understand . grady harp , september 05	1
umberto lenzis eaten alive my opinion way better than cannibal ferox . film so cheesy its hillarious . charectors , especially main male charector , funny watch . mane male charector slaps female role every 5 minutes so she calms down or so she dosnt give up their hiding place . worst thing film there 4 or 5 scenes different cannibal movies including lenzis man deep river . there also scenes lungle holocaust mountain cannibal god , i dont mean minor scenes , i mean big scenes , mostly gore scenes . scenes actually shot film some gory moments including decapitation , ear cut off cannibalization scene breast cut off . throw some brutal rape scenes topless me me lai you yourself pretty decent exploitation flick	1

all his other films , tarkovsky true author stalker . this film loosely based arkady boris strugatsky road side picnic , tarkovsky tried , he solaris ( 1972 ) , downplay science fiction aspect stalker . except brief explanation beginning film , tarkovsky chooses ignore speculations what could created zone , changes within it . he changed strugastsky brother characters events almost unrecognizably , he previously characters events lem solaris , he shifted philosophical implications story more pleasant direction . nevertheless , many original details novel remain . stalker definitely science fiction film , but its style unlike pulp high-tech films , such star wars trilogy ( 1977 - 1983 ) . it very demanding sometimes inaccessible viewing experience . this magnificent film almost not see light day . exteriors shot ( some three half months tallinn , estonia , beginning may 1977 , tarkovsky encountered number problems , starting some serious disagreements key members his crew , but mostly bad processing apparently out-of-date film stock . these events led serious financial problem , which somehow , almost miraculously , got resolved . eventually , june 1978 , second shooting tallinn took place , interiors shot moscow , premiere took place may , 1979 , total official disapproval . film met some recognition ussr , toward 1981 , following its success cannes festival 1980 , where it awarded prize ecumenical jury . stalker , tarkovsky marks shift toward his later style , long takes throughout film averaging one minute length , many which four minutes or longer . scene " telephone room " lasts almost seven minutes . these long scenes turn rely heavily talent actors sustain mood , like writer long monologue sand mogul room . even succession single shots , director wants give impression long take , such ride into zone flatbed car , which lasts three half minutes actually consists five shots . stalker , tarkovsky definitely more systematic his use black-and-white ( sepia ) color stocks than he his previous works . sickly black-and-sepia reserved polluted sterile reality world future , while color represents escape this world provided zone . swamp scene " stalker "' dream , tarkovsky reverts more usual convention , where dreams shown black-and-sepia-tones , reality color . however , last scene color , implying leakage powers zone into outside reality . always tarkovsky films , natural world present . water , which used source life , redemptive force center regeneration , now mostly symbol decay pollution . often , men wade through stagnant water , when clear water flows , it flows over rusting , decaying remnants props civilization : coins , weapons , religious images , hypodermic needles . only exception dream scene swamp , where water somewhat restored its positive , life-affirming symbols . last scene zone , men , resigned their limitations weakness , sit outside room rain falls inside , gently blocking them entering . wind , often associated spiritual aspects life , ominously rises when writer walks directly toward room , he told stop . earth positive force , upon arriving zone , " stalker "' first act lie down embrace it , swamp , all three men lie upon it . like miracle , there luxuriant , if dangerous , nature ever-present zone , contrast polluted outside world , where it totally absent . birds part this nature : call cuckoo bird heard numerous times zone . there also mysterious dog , which first appears swamp scene , when all three men lying down , becoming intimately close earth . up this point , men felt totally alienated their environment , outside inside zone , it very moment when they start meditate remember , dog appears : zone its territory . but end film , dog followed " stalker " outside zone , showing even there , hope men looking inside zone must somehow also exist here , outside , dog establishes its own space even though he becomes domesticated process . although tarkovsky usually favors classics such composers bach , pergolesi , or purcell , musical score stalker consists almost exclusively eduard artemiev electronic music mixed some folk melodies , contributing efficiently eerie atmosphere film . there also few distorted musical fragments wagner , ravel , beethoven . two tarkovsky favorite actors nikolia grinko anatoly solonitsyn . they appear five ( grinko ) four ( solonitsyn ) tarkovsky russian films , including stalker . their performances two lost souls search answer convincing . aleksandr kajdanovsky outstanding his role tormented somewhat pathetic " stalker " . although alisa frejndlikh appearance film restricted only few scenes , she powerful presence , especially her monologue end film . stalker , tarkovsky juxtaposes world decline , polluted sterile , verdant zone , which overtaken all human enterprises , shown remnants rusting cars tanks , dilapidated buildings , which taken over luxuriant vegetation . he portrays society which severed all links nature , its own past , , result , lost its spiritual moral bearings . stalker explores conflict science , rationalism , materialism , cynicism versus spirituality , faith , art , love . three men embody different philosophical principles . beginning film , professor justifies his going into zone pure scientific curiosity , probably also reassure himself room so-called " miracles " , if they ever happened , examined through scientific method explained logical , reasonable way . professor rational who tries understand world according law physics . however , when he arrives room , professor divulges his ulterior motive , which destroy it bomb he carrying all his knapsack . doing so , he would remove incentive people visit room irrational hopes , because " this place obviously won't bring anybody happiness . " blowing up room , professor stop gangsters , tyrants , megalomaniacs , all " self-appointed benefactors human race " misusing room power . but his main reason blow up room he not understand it . writer belongs those people who cannot accept world it . he well aware humanity decay his own well , but he abhors science , which he not understand , would rather look answers supernatural . writer believes redemptive power art , but he lost his inspiration . he would like believe potential room restore it , but because his cynicism self-loathing , he cannot sure . he lost faith himself his writing capacity help other people . besides , he hates writing , which him torture . " stalker " alone showing inclination toward faith , his comments regarding nature his prayer his companions " become helpless like children . " " stalker " knows zone , he total faith zone . he speaks it if it living . " stalker " simultaneously respects fears zone , he recognizes its potential provide comfort wretched ones who , like himself , lost all hope , but same time it punishes whoever transgresses its rules . this , course , how most religious people see their own gods . film contains many christian images biblical references , but it would mistake take them christian context : they stand general framework faith spirituality . redemptive power love personified " stalker "' wife . her love devotion final miracle which opposes cynicism emptiness modern world . all these ideas clearly expressed film end , she addresses audience her heartfelt monologue , while same time asking her husband remember love she feels him . three characters reach room , they ask their dearest wishes granted , but this would require painful searching self-examination , realization what they thought they wanted not exactly what they now really want . " you dream one thing but you get quite , " observes writer . film began question , " three men enter room ? " it ends , " why won't three men enter room ? " professor true aim destroy room , which beyond his scientific understanding . now he forced consider there may mystery his cartesian mind cannot account . he shows some humility acknowledges it not up him save humanity itself . writer said purpose his journey regain his genius , his inspiration . however , threshold room , he realizes he may not worthy accepting room gift . while he previously expressed his unworthiness , he now first time truly feels it . result their journey , both men changed -- some would say better -- although they not enter room , they nevertheless receive its gifts , something quite different than what they expected . " stalker " , however , asks nothing room because he stalker , stalkers not enter room . however , " stalker " faith zone , not need reassurances . he touch his " self , " aware his own wretchedness , his only purpose making trip guide faith hope those more wretched than he . musical fragments beethoven " ode joy , " last sequence , struggling heard over rumble passing train , imply society decay unsettled nature film resolution . this ending film typically tarkovskian , so far it open-ended , deliberately ambiguous , leaving viewer create his or her own meaning film .	1

this my first exposure penn teller wit , it wild - like sticking your head out car window into tornado . pennteller use humor , righteous outrage sarcasm attack some truly soft-headed people whose ideas continue pulsate national psyche . whether they 9/11 conspiracy nuts , people who see jesus their bathroom door or supposedly-scientific ghost trackers , pt go after them mercilessly called them out charlatans , frauds or fools . actually , they don't this exactly , since they'd trouble slander police . order demolish reputations those they dislike , they call them ( loudly ) * ssh*oles f*ck*rs . if this kind vituperative name-calling not your cup tea , least you warned . i like work pt . there far too many people making buck expense truth . whether you're peddling book claiming moon landing hoax , or selling tickets dallas , texas jfk conspiracy museum , or ( dalai lama ) trying get support re-establish priestly autocracy , you idiot or scammer deserve pt come after you hammer tong . some criticize pt using same techniques their targets use . i more bothered pt attacks humble people genuine faith . poor woman who sees jesus eyes her bathroom door may wrong , but least she doesn't appear profiting monetarily . that unlike woman who found image virgin mary her grilled cheese sandwich , who made few bucks when she sold sandwich casino . audrey santo family may faking " oils " drip statues their brain-damaged daughters ' room , but they living real family tragedy deserve some measure restraint . pt use these examples unfairly attack religion whole . they spout atheism if they want , but they could less abusive those genuine faith . who say god * doesn't * speak through sandwiches , bathroom doors tacos ? he limited whirlwinds burning bushes ? said , bs season 3 fun challenging . even when pt go over top , they provide plenty ponder	1

i first saw this drive-in my family when it released ; it billed second double feature ( remember them ? ) tell you truth , my memory main attraction -- probably something disney , given my age -- escaped me years . i immediately loved this film , however , seen it many times since tv . i finally bit bullet bought it dvd when it turned up really cheap amazon . not unsurprisingly , technicolor print stunning ( it looks better than any print quiet man -- which won oscar its technicolor cinematography--i've ever seen ); surprisingly , so trailer , which comprises only extra . there french english mono tracks addition dolby digital track , optional english subtitles . cheesy menus only interactive menus few options , there no hard-copy insert ( immediate minus my book ) , hence my one-star demerit . it could worse -- least it anamorphic , its list price accurately reflects paramount budget treatmen t.t he film itself delightful ; it one john ford last , complete joy ( i especially got kick out his using dorothy lamour south seas role ... second time 26 years , first hurricane ) . i second previous reviewer , however , noting there seem some gaps continuity , especially end . jack warden elizabeth allen , least , still around time this released dvd -- might it not nice commentary ? this wasn't one ford major works , but i can't imagine most fans wouldn't like hear what it like work him , not mention lee marvin immortal duke . alas . romance male bonding island paradise--what not like ? " pappy " gave us helluva good romp days before political correctness ( i'm still wondering how " oriental " came pejorative ) that not without poignancy , if it doesn't make you want beg , borrow , or steal fare polynesia asap , i respectfully submit you're probably somehow deficient	1

unlike probably most " john malkovich " fans , i actually saw later kaufman-jonze collaboration " adaptation " first . i thought , think , movie brilliant , but i little disappointed " john malkovich " first time i saw it . it very good , yes , but i hoping bit more , since most reviewers seem think it good or better than later film . well , yesterday i got through watching " john malkovich " third time , 2 years after i first saw it , it grown me quite bit . i still don't think it quite good " adaptation " , but it pretty close . " john malkovich " one those movies seems take place real world , except there bunch odd details aren't right . ex : puppeteering major artform ; everyone world total oddball ; there building 7 1/2 floor which contains portal into john malkovich brain . this movie so massively yet still so unobtrusively weird i'm sure it requires very specific taste fully get into it . you definitely need taste odd . story centers around craig schwartz , ( john cusack ) failed street-puppeteer who lives depression his strange but good-natured wife lotte ( cameron diaz ) their 100 or so pets . lotte suggests craig get job , real job , he so , becoming filing clerk small business 7 1/2 floor large office building . ( ceiling all 4 1/2 feet high , they emergency-stop elevator get floor . ) craig immediately smitten fellow 7 1/2 floor-dweller maxine ( catherine keener ) . maxine cruel cold-hearted individual , but craig can't help himself continues pursue her spite her utter contempt him . his efforts appear going nowhere until one day when he finds small door hidden behind filing cabinet . he crawls it discover this portal into john malkovich brain , where you watch what malkovich sees 15 minutes , after which you dumped ditch road then things really get weird , craig uses this portal way connect maxine , but lotte others get drawn malkovich finds out what going we learn real purpose portal . i don't want go , cause inexplicable , labyrinthine plot much appeal film . ( though it isn't just crazy crazy sake , actually comes together well . ) beyond this , kaufman tons clever , intelligent dialogue support wacky plo t.t his movie damn hard review , cause it so strange , yet much appeal humor character-driven . unbelievable , oddball characters all interesting , usually funny often endearing . cusack our main character sort straight man film . still , he not quite normal -- he , after all , want famous puppeteer . he typical " tortured artist " scruffy beard ponytail , but you can't help but like him . he just so hapless , john cusack always average man thing well . orson bean great dr. lester , craig boss 125 year old lech . ( craig says , " it pretty funny once you get past how disgusting it . ) catherine keener fantastic maxine , one most black-hearted characters i've ever seen . yeah , she doesn't physically hurt anyway , but her relentless verbal abuse unbelievable , she responds anything craig says her vicious , personal barb . finally , john malkovich wonderful himself ( sort ) , he hits great range notes isn't afraid make himself look bad . ( no one half brain would think this really anything who malkovich really , but lotsa people don't half brain ... ) though " john malkovich " comedy , it rather thoughtful ultimately very sad one . it touches themes isolation , desire someone else ultimate absurdity uncontrollability human life . this absurdity encapsulated central conflict , craig unrequited love maxine ; there no reason why he should love her , she , craig himself says , evil , but he can't help himself ; man capable reason , but emotion rules us emotion only sporadically makes sense . ( applying reason emotion never helps , not my experience , anyway . ) though i can't help but see kaufman primary author film , jonze deserves ton credit bringing vision fruition . making film this wacky seem real must damn near impossible , but jonze pulls it off aplomb spectacular technical proficiency . film moves near conventional scenes first-person perspective , dream sequences flat out surrealism . yet , all technique displayed film , it rarely seems extraneous . jonze doesn't seem showing off , flash all just necessary navigate inexplicable plot . score also fantastic , truly beautiful often-moving , it allows lot emotional impact film , particularly brilliantly conceived heartbreaking final scene . man , this review no good , but you can't justice movie this good this odd review . you'll just watch it . grade :	1

so it falls me review this first ? this june 1977 concert london rainbow theater captures recently reconfigured wailers ending european tour promote masterful ' exodus ' album . rare videotaped performances ' trenchtown rock ' ' rebel music ' , ' crazy baldhead ' , dating earlier wailers repertoire , performed wonderfully well here , treasures this collection , however . missed notes some songs , including beginning ' exodus ' , guitarist junior marvin failure notice his boss bob start singing ' lively up yourself ' , minor annoyances , loss aston barrett famous distinctive bass line ' no more trouble ' , jettisoned favor ' new ' , harder sound ( surely reaction exciting energy london ' new wave ' summer 1977 ) . way , it always annoyed me front cover picture vhs now dvd editions most definitely not this 1977 show , but rather same photo graces 1975 live lyceum album . i wish those responsible would show some responsibility well some historical accuracy . dvd sound picture good , considering age videotape source . now if they would only release 1980 dortmund , germany performance dvd . accompanying dvd ' carribbean nights ' informative enjoyable , provides good look marley life times . while it contains no full-length performances , it contain several exciting if brief film clips various performances such leeds , uk 1973 show peter tosh . hopefully these early performances someday make it onto dvd well .	1
una historia veridica llevada al cine magistralmente . todos los actores realizan unas actuaciones tan maravillosas que en realidad uno cree estar viviendo en el 1848 ... imanol arias ( ladislao gutierrez ) transmite tanta pasion , amor deseos prohibidos que es comprensible el por que camila , sacrifica todo por el . aparte de ser un actor increiblemente guapo , se adentra tanto en su personaje , que te hace llorar , amar , rezar sufrir con el . mi escena favorita es cuando camila le confiesa su amor le dice que se esta muriendo de amor , el le dice que eso es natural su edad , como queriendo ignorar que es de el que ella esta hablando . su amor ya en ese momento es mutuo el enferma de amor . lucha entre su amor por dios su amor por ella . definitivamente una pelicula que merece la pena ver , maravillosamente actuada , con unos efectos de luces tenuesque le dan un toque de romanticismo , una musica fabulosa , unos dialogos en susurros entre los enamorados llenos de pasion , la lucha carnal entre el amor humano el amor dios yun tragico final . mi pelicula favorita se la recomiendo todos ...	1
when i saw this dvd video store , i knew i would rent it , i thing mountains , despite feeling it would not very good movie . well , my expectations met . movie , although mildly enjoyable times its mountain views , pretty much stinker . it definitely not keeper . plot simple . scientific data indicates particular mountain urals eastern europe going undergo massive avalanche bring down half snow mountain onto ski resort . course , person who brings this information village mayor met derision . no one wants believe her . like john baptist , she voice crying alone wilderness . meanwhile , two mountain bad boys , brothers who run snowmobile tours mountains , their own troubles . younger one bad break-up resort owner daughter . other one his hands full keeping his wilder , younger brother check . resort owner daughter her own issues , her father his business partner . when inevitable happens disaster strikes , let games begin . over all , special effects repetitive , which expected , given fact this obviously low budget film . plot loosey-goosey , number silly sub-plots nowhere , script just plain bad . directing laughable ham-handed . acting , most part , dreadful , exception resort owner , who gives evidence some acting ability . no one this film should give up their day job just yet . bottom line viewers should take pass this film , unless , like me , you sucker mountains or disaster films . even then , viewers should proceed their own risk .	-1

while i believe book masterfully written , i kept asking myself when i reading it whether ellis deal devil - who dictated him confessions worst serial killer ever . it brilliant description 80s - you hear them , see them , almost touch them , they practically scream you pages ; dark portrait 80-th golden boy who went rampage . i not think there one woman world who would enjoy book ; admire it , respect it - yes but enjoy it ... well , there one woman , mary harron , who liked respected ap so much she decided transform it screen - it worked . she cut down gore sex concentrated satire . i liked film when i saw it first time ; i love it now after second viewing . surprisingly restrained funny - it one best scenes i've seen films lately - war credit cards . show belongs christian bale - he delivers patrick bateman , rich beautiful 26 year old wall street banker secrets so dark he makes dr. lector look like sesame street character . bale cold , charismatic , misogynist turn riveting . his james bondian-esque face changes devilish mask reptilian eyes so rapidly , your blood would freeze .	1

starting 1960 success american international pictures release " fall house usher " , producer/director roger corman began highly successful collaboration legendary hollywood actor vincent price adapting number edgar allan poe short stories into very atmospheric horror films glowing rich technicolour . they really reached their creative peak their second teaming classic story " pit pendulum " , which my favourite all efforts they worked together . roger corman long known low budget " " , movies specialist here outdone himself incredibly lavish looking production while little relation original poe story manages weave fascinatingly eerie tale helped one vincent prices ' best performances this genre . " pit pendulum " , apart employing macabre torture device title its gripping conclusion also boasts magnificently eerie sets , great period detail beautiful tones colour sure warm heart any classic horror movie lover . story opens , ( unusually poe story ) , 16th century spain where we see young francis barnard ( john kerr ) , travelling up sinister seaside castle his brother-in-law don nicholas medina ( vincent price ) . coming all way england however this not just social call he seeking answers sudden death his sister elizabeth ( barbara steele ) , who nicholas ' wife . nicholas however most complex character himself attempts brush aside any discussion regarding elizabeth demise putting down simply some problem her blood . he secretly tormented memory his sadistic father sebastian medina ( also vincent price flashbacks ) , who member spanish inquisition set up his own private torture chamber basement castle . sebastian also responsible burying alive his unfaithful wife before his young son eyes . his tormented state nichiolas also fears he may responsible burying elizabeth alive well very soon strange noises heard castle including sound someone playing harpsichord only elizabeth could play . all these strange occurences seem indicate nicholas right guessing elizabeth come back dead torment him his crime . nicholas counselled supposedly sympathetic family doctor charles leon ( anthony carbone ) , elizabeth could not alive what he hearing his mind while francis who still trying uncover exactly what happened his sister begins suspect doctor gets impression he anxious him his way before anything discovered . however matters take turn worst when nicholas ' mind finally breaks when elizabeth previously locked room ransacked he takes persona his demented father believing he still back time inquisition . when elizabeth actually seems " rise dead " , however she her " accomplise " , plans goes badly wrong dealing sadistic " sebastian " , rather than mentally destroyed " nicholas " , planned both meet grisly ends deep pit cellar imprisonment deadly iron maiden torture devise . francis also runs into trouble reborn sebastian who now views him enemy removed francis finds himself thrilling climax strapped table below rapidly decending swinging pendulum sharp cutting blade . it only quick thinking nicholas ' sister catherine ( luana anders ) , he rescued tortured nicholas meets his own grisly end falling into castle pit . rarely any corman /vincent price collaborations lavish " pit pendulum " . wonderful visuals nicholas ' sinister castle literally howering mist shrouded cliff opening scenes tremendously atmospheric castle interiors thickly laden opulent furniture , mysterious sliding panels cobweb filled torture chamber all manner fiendish devices , this film special treat horror movie lover . vincent price course centre all attention here his colourful roles both tormented nicholas medina flashbacks , his evil father sebastian he brings his usual polished performing skills dual roles making " pit pendulum " , one his most memorable films 1960 . john kerr still best remembered his performance broadway film version " tea sympathy " , surprisingly makes fairly colourless young male lead here really doesn't appear much his character making it one weakness acting ensemble present . barbara steele , mysteriously dubbed here some reason , antony carbone villians piece wonderful their roles carbone especially really excels " caring " , doctor who not all he first seems . period film roger corman gone all out visuals " pit pendulum " , rich colour authentic 16th century costumes really capturing flavour time . creepy atmosphere further enhanced thunder storms lightening course almost essential element most horror tales but which here become almost character themselves raging storms seem build momentum ferosity nicholas ' state mind slowly crumbles . vincent price really complete rebirth demand actor horror films result his hugely popular efforts these roger corman horror films american international . he always brings integrity style his characters no matter how over top proceedings taking place stories . sight deranged vincent price gleefully hovering over john kerr tied down beneath swinging pendulum probably one most famous horror images 1960 this startling climax story helps make " pit pendulum " , essential part any horror lovers film library . highly recommended .	1
not just disaster : total turkey ages ! every misstep director make while tackling artist bio-pic made here holland .

what heck taking this series so damn long reach dvd nice box set , it one most treasured series among " gi joe/transformers/thundercats " generations , yet amazingly well , well written , well animated , it , there never toy line , or serious merchandising there could`ve ( even adult , i`d still love set dd action figures main characters ) ... but there dvds every other cartoon series this generation except this one ( well amazingly well " legend prince valiant " , which also deserves box set dvds ... easily ... ) simply inexcusable ...!!!! what shocks me actually , producer this series marvel entertainment , who well known whore-out just everything every little penny they get , so it actually comes quite bit shock indeed ... what they waiting ? haven`t they seen popularity every other dvd set so far best saturday morning shows sales no-brainer look sales " battle planets , land lost , gi joe , thundercats , transformers , etc etc etc ... ) . c`mon guys , wake up smell money .... i`ll first line ... i saw actual boxed set record store other day " complete series " , but it made " outside usa dvd players " ... it looked like professional release , not cheap bootleg , so i really pissed ... i want box set good `ol usa ... anybody else any thoughts	1

ah , those bygone days when british studios like ealing shepperton churned out little classics like this regular basis . stalwarts era all here , including wilfred hyde-white , bernard cribbins , course , sellers . those who know sellers his later , american period find this character little unusual ; he more sharp tough guy who runs operation than he bumbling fool he later perfected . plot simple ; sellers co . want break out prison , commit heist , then break back into prison so they perfect alibi . it all sounds quite masterful but , course , things go terribly awry . fans sellers and/or golden era british comedy , this definitely one check out	1
this excellent portrayal play . i can't think anyone who could've made better cyrano than jose ferrer . i haven't seen later version gerard depardieu , but heard it good . there just something old black white movies . perhaps best part movie swordplay actually authentic ! not lot crappy gratuitous blade-twirling like you see today movies . you'd hard-pressed see better rapier dagger any movie . all all , excellent show	1
like other reviewers , i think sequel better than original . one only hopes 3rd installment issued even better footage than first two , especially if more 35mm films found . color adds lot drama presentation , mixing horror war death camps pompous nazi celebrations . seeing these period films , it hard believe nazis members human race . nowadays , top college football players drafted national football league take test basic intelligence , wonderlic test . score 30 , out possible 50 , considered good score . hitler other top nazis would lucky score 10 this test , because they simply couldn't count . what else could possibly explain attacking russia declaring war america ? same time , leaving great britain unconquered , available later western front . nazis outnumbered no chance win , long run . all their self-proclaimed superiority , these guys simply not smart . thing strikes me , especially seeing atomic bombs exploding over japan , how incredibly lucky germans . hitler launched his last western counteroffensive december , 1944 . this " battle bulge , " american terms . if he succeeded , world war ii could stretched out 3 months or more . if happened , atomic bombs may probably would used nazi germany . thank heaven didn't happen but it could . excellent dvd like this one should make us all appreciate what we today , despite current happenings middle east elsewhere . there lot kindness decency seen around us , things short supply 60-70 years ago . 1940-45 , world stood brink total destruction we found way out . let hope believe good triumph over evil again	1
okay , i admit it ; linda abba schmuck . after 30 years , they still getting massive airplay all over world , lot people who would never admitted they into this group years ago now acknowledging what we collectively always knew : most everyone loves abba , except some us never admit it . that okay , though , because i went through my later teens up until my late 30 . all you closet fans out there , this dvd great purchase , because you finally realize it not these four incredibly talented people fault they chemistry public reacted . even their manager stig andersson , who propelled them fame , doesn't know why they took off way they . let me ask all you naysayers all-important question : if this group so disposable , how it their music still so popular after 3 decades , they not only enjoyed revival , but music made great stage production ? it true : benny andersson bjorn ulveus very good songwriters their sesibilities them all times . agnetha faltskog anni-frid lyngstad , their former wives partners , beautiful vocalists together , what they them something very special while it lasted . also , they never reunion since their breakup 1982 , they don't intend . heartless hit machine rep they've suffered not only joke , but this dvd show you just how human talented they really . one thing i struck this particular dvd how warm , intelligent , humble bjorn ulveus , how much more likable full life frida , rather than pretty blond pinup girl agnetha , actually . this dvd full lots surprises naysayers lots treats those us who knew these swedes talented , personable beings who simply disliked touring all reasons anyone who never toured could understand . interviews fun , footage priceless , music rich melodious . most all , you pull this dvd out your player smile your face realize you never dress like you any time group together again ! this 90 minutes pure , poppy fun .	1
what fast turning out one biggest years ever cinematic retreads ( doesn`t anybody out hollywood any new ideas anymore ? ) , " longest yard " second remake robert aldrich film hit theaters past six months . first , " flight phoenix , " released last december . now all we ask , " new improved " version " whatever happened baby jane ?, " starring jane fonda sissy spacek , far behind ?. this new edition `70`s hit , adam sandler plays paul crewe , ex-quarterback pittsburgh steelers who banished league six years earlier allegedly shaving points off game . when he arrested stealing his girlfriend car , crewe sent texas prison run diabolical warden his cadre sadistic guards . warden , football fan way back , enlists crewe expertise putting together team convicts take guards " friendly little game " intramural football . caveat this ragtag team must good enough make decent show things but not good enough beat their opponent or there hell pay . thus , game becomes inverted , high stakes encounter pitting forces good ( prisoners ) against forces evil ( penal authorities ) . thirty years elapsed since i saw original version this film , so i don't feel particularly qualified evaluate how this new one stacks up against old . i say , however , this " yard " faces some serious problems get-go casting sandler lead role . burt reynolds , who played protagonist original film who gets fairly good-sized role this one well , least credible man who might professional football player . but adam sandler !? come think it , sandler probably more believable nfl legend than he hot underwear spokes-model , absurdity we also asked swallow - but less said better . there isn't much recommend this latest edition " longest yard . " plotting predictable , characters mere two-dimensional stereotypes humor obvious lowbrow . final showdown - i.e. big game - goes so long most tension inherent material simply drains away long before closing credits . perhaps saddest aspect this movie watching cloris leachman making complete utter fool herself playing grotesque , beehive-coiffured sex maniac obsessed seducing young mr. crewe . some sights we should just not asked face this lifetime .	-1
let me start stating i read tab pretty well , i've studying excellent instructor year , i'm real bug getting stuff i play sound ' right ' . right , i mean it needs least same feel close phrasing - doesn't mechanically note note . but , sometimes , capture feel multitrack recording single guitar you make allowances exactness . still , it sound right , sound good . secondly , this deserves more than 5 stars . i've got several different tab sources hendrix , dvd ( excellent ) instructor , working couple jimi tunes . thought i least scaled-back versions down pretty good . i've watched most this set once-through now , it left my jaw floor . richness detail blew me a-way . time you're through 2nd or 3rd song set , you'll glad they chopped them up into measure gave you half-speed demos so you wouldn't miss any detail . even rhythm parts need slowed down so you see what going . not tab - heck , go get it . then you'll best both worlds ( but this world better , trust me ! ) . i grew up hendrix music ; i know stuff my head , almost heart . but theory explanations velvert turner combined dead-on normal half-speed split-screen demos andy goldmine what they reveal . how music phrased huge part sound , you're not going get just tab . seeing it performed here , close-up fretwork split inset screen picking strumming gives you . that hard find , heaven knows why anyone would knock i t.t he delivery set feels choppy times because breaking songs down few measures time . but sonic landscape jimi work so rich thick i don't see how else they could it still keep our heads exploding ! bear mind many tab sources you're going get essentially going " easy guitar " version these songs , not real deal details full half-speed demos digestible pieces . getting it concert - fuggedaboudit ! besides period quality problems most hendrix footage , you realize there problems directorial idea what makes good entertainment . usually conflicts what makes good instructional source . comparison , go rent srv live el macambo see how much you glean how play stevie , even though it capture much better technology much more recently . or , get " lightning bottle " see if you figure out much masterful acoustic version " can't satisfied " buddy guy plays . concert footage not shot teach you how play , there no freakin ' way this should dismissed favor old concert footage training aid . you'd need your head examined if you . i'd strongly recommend dvd version this set so you go directly your favorite section . also , some dvd players let you step through varying speeds loop given segment over over . trust me - some those jimi solos you're going want those extra tech tools handy ! i simply am amazed anyone panned this set . it gem source material anyone truly wants play hendrix so it should like it should . can't imagine what they expecting so dissappointed it . so far i know there isn't anything else out there like it . if there - axis or ladyland - i want it	1

kaufman adaptation michael crichton japan-bashing potboiler realtively light approach , simple buddy-cop movie featuring pair entertaining star performances . spite fact novel alarmism dangers dominant japan would soon undercovered mellow script confers much more importance opposite views eastern western worlds around lot issues , director muted xenophobic material made book so terrific brutal , transforming it into interesting film , whose plot nourished great visual effects stunning differences both cultures , sean connery working out common link two ways life great doses suggested violence alarming use technology create unexpeceted accusations . yet sean connery makes very credible performance , detective , script seems uncapable surmount anecdothic character good guys bad guys , ominous presence japanese mob pretensions noir film , picture leaves us bitter taste , because even if there good sequences , whole material promised best best major intentions .	1
not watch this garbage ! this worst movie i ever seen . i'm honestly upset other reviewers here misleading me so badly . this film so bad , so many problems i don't know where even begin . i only hope someone verge watching this changes their mind after reading this review . if i saved one person buying/watching this disaster , then i my job . very least buy it used bin , that where mine	-1
first , i not rate this poorly comparing it original . i looked this its own movie not think it remake . also , unlike many reviewers , i no problem fact humans talked yet still oppressed not fighting back . majority humans history our planet oppressed afraid fight back . american culture freedom not historical norm . said , i not thrilled overall plot movie , nor quality acting , though special effects pretty good , imho . theme , however , struck me most rememorable this movie , caused me drop otherwise 3 1 ( or less ) , one which deeply rooted beliefs apes held so easily stripped away . our " hero " encourages friendly girl ape come him see something amasing change her world ( forgive my not remembering their names ) , it portrayed manner what he doing good noble something we should all grateful , even though what he showing her intended bring all her previously held beliefs crashing down . then there second-in-command ape who very devoted their ape religion , yet moment he enters spaceship , he instantly comes believe everything he previously held sacred lie - just like . i couldn't help feel if movie trying say audience , " hey , haven't you heard guy darwin ? yeah ? then why you still believe silly god person yours ? " this movie , i believe try touch issue day , secularism verus religion . movie , it seems , coming down heavily side secularism	-1

i still don't understand love crash , recent film centering racism issue . it seemed like film couple good ideas but they featured bad movie which makes its win best picture all more confusing . film some reason reminded me traffic which centers important issue ; this one drug war its effects addicts non-addicts . while you obviously tell traffic important film it indeed good one , it also slightly marred erratic pacing bit uninteresting characters . film , unlike let say , magnolia or short cuts , 3 separate storylines one thing common : drug trade . one story set ohio , robert wakefield newly-appointed " drug czar " crusading against decreasing amount drugs country . however , he daughter that quickly starting get addicted . san diego , helena sees her husband arrested while she unaware he key player drug trade captured dea agents who going testify . finally mexico , highway patrol cop gets involved corruption drug cartels want control drugs going out mexico us . help audience differentiate different places , color code given each segment . wakefield story looks so unbelievably blue you wouldn't surprised if character blood looked blue too . san diego looks more traditional but bit overexposed making it more brighter while mexico looks like indie movie very gritty raw feel jittery looking camera . it helps keep track where you but like i said , you've never seen skin tones look so blue before ; they really overdid it some cases . best storyline most likely mexico since it anchored benicio del toro who certainly deserved his oscar . it also got more interesting story better look it despite its intentional amateurishness . one isn't great probably wakefield story since it never gripped me all much . san diego alright but nothing special . ultimately problem film film just felt slow . ever watch one those movies where it feels like you've watching longer than movie ? not mention sometimes one storyline starting get interesting then whoosh ! off somewhere else . similar problem plagued babel since chieko story ultimately more emotional gripping than others . some probably disagree say all stories traffic good but i always groaned slightly when we moved away mexico . it certainly ambitious film so not going argue there it great film times but i wouldn't say it my favorite film 2000	1
i've skiing now nearly 10 years during this time i've many ski instructors different styles teaching but nothing compares information prodived this dvd . lito goes straight point tells you exactly what you need know early weight shift correct body position various runs easy blues serious off piste . within day or two practicing his techniques i found myself carving more arcs more control my skis . which face it , real reason we all wanted ski first place . not only am i more control but once i feel like i am progressing out intermediate rut . this dvd gives lots freeze frames easy understand instruction which you practice minute you hit slopes . i found dvd so useful i ended up buying his book well which gives you even more insight into different techniques small radius arcs mogul runs . thus i go ski holiday which i've just returned boy this book complement dvd . i'm more visual learner myself reckoned book wouldn't add any more additional information but i safely say i wrong . total running time this dvd just under 60 mins he repeat himself alot but this just proves concrete how important some core aspects his ski technique . anyway i highly recommend this dvd believe me you won't dissappointed	1
this film unlike any documentary i've ever seen before . it combines various cinematic styles -- albert maysles ' uncut , " direct cinema " approach , michael moore " guerilla documentary " approach . characters all nuanced , complex personalities , filmmakers startingly good job not passing judgment allowing us see characters who they really . rather than simplistic anti-bush doc , film meditation how media , money , politics combine reak havoc life already troubled man . i highly , highly recommend this film , not only those who interested intersection media , money , politics , but those who interested experiencing great filmmaking	1
all reviews i've read this movie , they're pretty mixed opinion . some people ranging how movie sucked how " scantly dressed " female characters ( i.e. , jill valentine alice ) ect . but really , reviews --- most part --- could not more far truth than miami dolphins lost baltimore .

some interesting dialogue sprinkled within mostly nonsensical , dull , slow plot . also , whole thing swedish hard read english subtitles . blah . film critics love this one because it gives them bizarre , convoluted material upon which ponder self-importantly . it really not worth pondering , though .	-1

population hong kong approximately 7 million people . i'd say half them get shot this movie . usually when movie runs over 2 hours , it because there lot plot director wanted squeeze . case hard boiled , running time 126 minutes clearly necessitated john woo desire get into guinness book records " most people killed gunfire single motion picture . " chow yun-fat charismatic actor who bring wonderful balletic grace gunplay , this movie gives him plenty opportunity show his stuff . he shoots ( usually pistol each hand ) while diving headlong over furniture , while swinging rope , while sliding down banister (!) , while hurled through air explosions . sometimes he even shoots while standing still . he shoots , shoots , shoots . bad guys shoot , shoot , shoot . yun-fat fellow cops shoot , shoot , -- you get idea . there some fine action scenes this film , but my eyes glazing over long before it ended . there wasn't enough distinguish one scene bunch people machine-gunned next , it became painfully repetitious . personally i would highly recommend replacement killers over hard boiled . there plenty yun-fat balletic shoot-em-up action , but not so much you find yourself odd position lulled sleep gunfire	-1

i saw this movie i found it both shocking choking . it displays children young 4 years old smoking cigarettes ! filmmakers take into account damage tobacco could these child stars ? ( yes , cigarettes smoke real , not cg . ) i think they should omitted such scenes script , because it displays behavior that not only illegal several countries , but also threatening both society childhood . no matter what other reviewers thought movie , i give it disgusting 1 , this last movie i ever watch depicts smoking children . those haven't yet watched this movie , please don't watch it , unless you want cancer win health wars . here i hand out lesson every active or aspiring moviemaker : if you want depict smoking children , use computer graphics instead real thing	-1

fan zombie movies someone who enjoyed city living dead zombie , i very disappointed house cemetery . fulci manages create good mystery first two-thirds movie , only squander it some poorly executed scare scenes . house cemetery researcher ( whose work never specified ) who moves his wife his kid into house massachussets order finish out work colleague who killed himself his mistress . titular house only place they really find moment , so dr. boyle , his wife lucy their son bob move despite lot bad signs , like boarded-up door cellar tombstone dr. jacob tess freudstein front hall . bob little red-headed girl friend who keeps warning him how bad house ( though no one else sees her ) . furthermore , people keep claiming dr. boyle town before non-existent daughter ( which he denies , not totally convincingly ) . he also seems some secret relationship babysitter , anne , who starts unboarding cellar door middle night . lucy seems either recovering or suffering serious psychological issues . got ? good , because half stuff never gets explained . only things get worked out little red-headed girl identity identity killer ( neither which hard figure out ) . there some nice visual moments earlier parts film ( fact killer one normal hand one rotting hand , photograph changes each viewing , mannequin gets beheaded starts bleeding ) but fulci ability handle gore moments disappoints . he lingers too long over some deaths , makes killer so ridiculously slow snail could outrun him bits like babysitter head falling down stairs come off funny rather than scary . compared injury eye scene zombie or christopher george chopping through coffin cotld , dr. boyle chopping through door around his son head feels like self-parody . fulci other films incoherent plots , but rarely way seems work against plot ( dream-like nature city living dead seems appropriate given prophetic dream heroine gets mystical nature threat ) execution setpieces usually fantastic . house cemetery neither thing working its favor . it not hell living dead-level bad , but fact it some genuinely good acting ( especially paolo malco , who plays dr. boyle ) interesting set-up almost make flaws worse . also , this version " never before seen deleted scene " , but it no sound just extended reaction shot after bat attack	-1

" above rim " entertaining street drama focuses around kyle lee watson , inner-city high school basketball player who shows lot promise but lets his own arrogance get best him . he won't listen anybody who offers him advice how improve his game , he thinks he best player ever . he hoping his mad skills catching college scout attention , but he catch birdie eyes when he plays . birdie well known gang leader who offers kyle good life so long he plays his neighborhood team " shoot-out " basketball contest means world him . kyle -- impatient ever -- agrees join , not seeing clear danger front him . high school security guard past knows danger birdie presents , he only who chance get through kyle before it too late . not only this very good basketball movie , but it also intense character-driven drama centered around choices we make life ... how we live them long run . film some great performances duane martin , marlon wayans late tupac shakur . even though everybody great their roles , showstopper indeed shakur . he gives very masterful performance really sticks out stay you long after movie over . my only complaint length movie . it true movie runs little over hour half isn't short , but i think story characters open more possibilities add movie . i think more opportunities risks could taken further enrich story . still , it really good movie didn't disappoint me . dvd doesn't whole lot offer . you either watch movie widescreen or fullscreen , depending your preference . movie looks sounds very good . only special features offered movie trailers , those aren't even great . i would've loved it if they included music video , " regulate " warren nate dogg . fact , given some great rap songs this movie , they could've included couple music videos . it not great dvd , but least it not expensive . i really enjoyed " above rim . " it may not flawless , but it definitely more right than wrong . characters what really dominate movie . even if you're not fan game , it still something check out if you're fan character drama . exciting , intense , conflict-driven full heart , " above rim " very well film . -michael cran	1
i remember watching this high school . i thought it great fun then my kids think it still now . okay , we're not talking academy award material here ( emmy ? ) . ralph , bill , pam back third final season this far too short series man who given suit aliens gives him super powers . he teamed fbi agent help world survive itself . first few minutes ralph looses instruction book must noodle out how operate suit . he runs into few walls , literally . first season little rough . second season fleshed out concept . this third season started stretch its legs but show cancelled . i looked years novels based show , no avail . i even contacted cannell ask if i could write them . disney half-heartedly working feature film based show cannell wouldn't cut loose permission . alas , it would've fun . anyway , if you other two seasons you'll love this one . only complaint/change i would make play theme song before each episode . i would've made it so you could hit " forward next " button go right action . also , jacket plays bit theme song . i wish they'd made it possible change batteries . mike hudspeth st. louis , missour	1

scratching deeper beyond surface one find return seven significantly different its predecessor , magnificent seven . it much more than thematically framed sequel which it easily mistaken . return seven dark film it not offer hope truly optimistic future any its characters . this respect it complete inversion magnificent seven . through their catharsis original we saw attempt redemption through act nobility part seven . they truly noble i believe redeemed their transgressions gunmen . some thought they could start their lives over again but inevitably they could not . film end it seven ultimately all committed their singular code ethics morality emotionally charged finale . this film there very little emotion surface . instead director burt kennedy gives us thought provoking study into human psyche very nature defeatism human spirit . this film there no pretensions part seven . most them this just gun job . there no higher aspirations they cognizant . if it not this job , it would next . tell his story burt kennedy focuses almost entirely character chris leader , perfectly portrayed again yul brynner . this not really tale seven . instead kennedy uses brynner all his aplomb apparent stoicism curiously examine probe motivations other six , lorca villain ( pompously played mexican director emilio fernandez ) several other key characters . effect kennedy takes what apparently happy or satisfactory ending magnificent seven asks what if . what if 10 years later remaining characters not so contented prior events led us believe they would ? would friends willing go up against innumerable odds ? would strangers once again sign go up against those same innumerable odds ? strong still help weak ? who really strong weak ? when 50 or more marauding vaqueros whisk away chico ( julian mateos ) other mexican farmers surrounding villages chris vin ( robert fuller ) agree come his aid . however it chris alone recruits members " seven " this time out . kennedy singularly endows chris sense morality level headedness this film comes his wisdom manner nobility . effect this brynner film all way . just john sturges ' directorial style so smooth his own storytelling glossed right over depth complexity his own work so burt kennedy . however , kennedy challenged very dark brooding tale tell . where sturges ' magnificent seven could easily taken purely action film level still successful , kennedy not luxury . kennedy deliver action film built previous events he also approach story different perspective remain fresh yet keep it thematically concept original " seven . " not easy task ! if viewer not look deeply into this film it may just appear well produced `dud . ' however , i believe kennedy succeeds far beyond expectations more times i view this film . again it comes back brynner . he makes members seven ( vin , chico colbee ) all come realizations themselves his subtle yet profound dialogue . he gives riker luis chance redemption even though both men come total opposites spectrum . he helps failed priest rise his failures " least far his knees . " chris even gives lorca , villain chance ride out because when chris younger he gave him same chance . however , chris refuses let lorca now bathe his personal grief ineffectual father " other men blood . " yet even lorca literally redeemed end film . when petra tells chris farmers never forget them he simply replies , " that all man ask . " mystique legacy " seven . " even character chris endowed human flaws . he recklessly took young manuel rounding out seven " luck " tragic results we see brynner deeply grieved screen . this film hard lessons learned . technically this well-made film . cinematography full crane , dolly tracking shots , which gives it both perspective movement . bernstein score full lush this single cohesive element keeps seven together . set designs dark , grim rustic giving film pensive psychological depth . payoff brynner viewer comes final shot . looking farmers rebuilding village he comments , " i'll damned . " vin looks him responds , " i doubt . i doubt very much . " they both ride off . they just don't make heroes like any more	1

a-team-the complete third season now available dvd . dual sided dvd box set includes all 25 episodes shows 1984-1985 season . a-team very popular series during 80 . co-star mr. owes much his 1980 success a-team . mr. , b.a. , didn't really much screen time hannibal ( george peppard ) or characters face murdock , but he easily most recognizable member cast . season 3 , similar previous seasons filled with-action , adventure , exotic locals , disguises , interesting situations . season begins episode " bullets bikinis " ( airdate 9/18/84 ) . when mob attempts take over hotel a-team rescue her hotel . strange twist , two part episode " bend river " falls into slot second third episodes season . usually when series two part episode early season episode used season premiere . well , " bend river " actually slow episode which may explain why it not used season premiere . this episode archeologist traveling amazon region looking secrets but he finds conflict local pirates bad guy named el cahon . soon hannibal seen movie set dressed up monster costume aquamaniac . after he fired , face tries convince producer keep him . no film work keeping them occupied , they decide help tanya ( archeologists girlfriend ) find her missing archeologist boyfriend . season three , a-team begun lose little it magic fan base . compared miami vice , a-team seemed little quirky corny times . despite this , it still great show fans show should add season three their collection because there some good episodes during season . season three special guests include markie post ( nightcourt ) , dennis franz ( nypd blue ) , kristen meadows .	1
i heard lot hoopla dan brown fictional novel . most it trash ; people claim brown opened pandora box christianity , when , reality , he nothing more than sway fickle , while reinforcing beliefs those who thorough research . interestingly , history channel documentary brown fictional novel quite enlightening . read material those involved jesus seminar , i feel they nothing more than bunch left-wing quacks . yet , people took part , gained fame , jesus seminar quite genius . here group people successfully made millions dollars because speculation . fact , sir arthur conan doyle agatha christie , together , could not written better speculative fiction . course , documentary shines lot light this otherwise dark bit pseudo-history . first , documentary discusses various " possibilities " historical jesus . they take several books brown cited list , which located back his book , explore possibility their true . each book brown cited , sticks , nothing more than fickle assumptions based upon skewed views beliefs . while i am not against speculation , because hypotheses push research discovery , i am against presenting something truth when there no real evidence . even one authors holy blood , holy grail makes appearance history channel doc . what he say his own novel ? he basically says his books not prove anything ; all he attempting convey possibility there could jesus royal blood line . sum up documentary : history channel excellent job exposing pure speculation dan brown , all others involved accusing christians not seeing " true " historical jesus . while there some questions historians still need answer , anything ancient , jesus still stands test time , firmly . i surprised history channel position repute claims dan brown , jesus seminar , but they , very well , too . take time sit watch this great documentary if you unsure , skeptical , or scared what dan brown novel say christianity . you not let down .	1

this excellent film . billy bob clean-vut barber who keeps himself . his wife married him because she liked he didn't talk very much . it tragedy epic proportions , great performances all involved . only thing me holds this back five star film fact every single scene someone lights up cigarette or taking deep drags one . alone justifies this film " " rating . when watching this film , it seems they encouraging people " cool " smoking pleasurable thing . most notorious moment me when frances mcdormand sitting bathtub asks her barber husband ( billy bob ) shave her legs . he walks somberly cigarette drooping his lips she tells him give her drag . this putrid moment just drove me crazy ! but then , just my opinion . overall , film could good greater if it not incessant smoking throughout . plot slow yet intensely emotional . if you don't mind smoking , then you probably enjoy this dramatic tragedy . if you strongly opposed smoking or children who interested seeing this , you should review film before letting them see it	1

this horrendous movie . i never claim it movie my generation . it one many reasons why i absolutely hate " 80 " . others : breakdancing , yuppie lifestyle , power hungry businessmen/women , women manly handshakes , new wave music , junk movies like this . i know main character nothing less than manipulator who only concerned himself , what he get out life . he ridicules his friend because he sick , doesn't feel like driving ferris around ... especially ferrari mysteriously gets lost parking garage , so what am i left believe i wonder if this where ice cube got inspiration " it good day " . i don't care what decade it , or what cool back then , or now manipulating your friends " not " i repeat " not " cool . i know john johnette . public this something sexual relase . i could picture private parts men women everywhere getting soaking wet this movie , i find it so repulsive everyone out there finds this funny .	-1

buy this movie . read book . movie very beautiful i personally love watch it regular basis , but script takes huge liberties history . although this really masterful film making many respects , actual story book more interesting , more complex , we get find out what happened these actual people after their seabiscuit collaberation ended . whole tale one worth knowing . unlike jeff bridges character , seabiscuits ' owner acomplished horseman who attended military school served cavalry . didn't see movie ... most movies based history leave out awful lot . none us sit through six hour show . so just remember you never get accuracy hollywood , you get great show . there difference . gone wind same injustice it ; movie romantic pastiche while book astonishingly different . might wanna read one too . if you ever rode or spent any time track you'll need fix this movie periodicly just see magnificent racing scenes , so just keep it shelf . get letterbox one ... just georgeous !	1

utterly fascinating look crash burn american family . father , arnie friedman , witness his mother inappropriate self-serving sexual activity ; unsurprisingly , he turns out pedophile whose penchant buying kiddie mags gets him investigaged child rape . his wife , elaine , who looks like years arnie sucked life out her , walks around fog , totally bewildered a)she married such creepy little freak b)her three boys prefers dad her . oldest son dave his own state denial his father problems blames it all mom . most sympathetic figure youngest boy jesse , who imprisoned 13 years most unsympathetic crime . arnie jesse rape those little boys ? interviewed accuser comes across less than credible - he contradicts himself , can't remember first episode molestation ( though remembers plenty else ) when asked explain important detail , hesitates though he thinking " what heck i say now ? " feds appear caught up same hysteria got bunch innocent day care providers tossed prison 1980s - they used interview techniques more like criminal interrogations hypnosis ( reknown inducing false memories . ) way manipulate damage little kids , you dumb cops . any case , arnie self-admitted pedophile his taste child porn victimizes his whole family , especially jesse ( possibly more ways than one . ) despite this , his boys absolutely adore him . it hard understand why - their home movies , dad comes across emotional dud , flat affect distant stare . most animated he gets when he pounds out " i'm heaven " piano night before he goes prison . oldest son david especially apologist arnie . he implies if elaine not such cold fish arnie wouldn't predicament he ended up . you just want slap dave around facts life : " david ! wake up ! your parents didn't sex because daddy likes little boys !

after looking some reviews , i'll admit i'm bit confused . i think this made after gettysburg so any motivation remorse couldn't much " andersonville " .... younger civil war/war northern aggression student , i read mackinlay kantor book " andersonville " while there much vile see this film , it show why written word still most powerful weapon war . kantor descriptions writing defy depiction even most skilled set-dresser . nobody , i mean nobody , federal or confederate , officer or enlisted man , young or old come out situation such andersonville looking particularly well -- post-liberation photographs show it , just post-liberation photographs auschwitz , dachau , bergen-belsen . german film 1950s " doctor stalingrad " which purported show conditions german pow camp soviet union after world war ii , great film " hart war " depict relative shangri-la conditions ... someone who knows little pow situation during this great american conflict , i would recommend dvd " andersonville " but not isolation . it must tempered rounded knowledge conditions northern camps -- which appear history channel regularly ... recognition after prisoner exchange discontinued , nothing short genocide fairly grand scale could result . i recall television documentary trial andersonville commander , whic starred all people william shatner -- back 1970s or so ... which i quite impressed should resurrected . but present , films such " andersonville " replete underlying messages horrors war , humans make war then complain conditions which inevitable , despite our intelligence we not found alternative it -- yet . if this film inspires one intellect put his or her head solution this problem , then there no more andersonvilles .... this film shows how easily humans who civilized ( we think ) descend into psychosocial dynamics crowd , group , herd , plundering devaluing human life mere livestock	1

before i saw this fantastic animated masterpiece , my only contact japanese anime ' when my nieces nephews came visits ( they interested watching ninja/karate/sailor moon , etc ) . these cartoons , although hypnotic mesmerizing kids , seemed mindless no real message ( not there anything wrong ) . one evening this past january , i flipping through channels when i came upon tcm thursday night special tribute hayao miyazaki . i listened pre-feature info-guy describing great artistry storytelling this director thought " i'll give it 2 minutes then continue flipping " . after only ten minutes i found myself totally immersed experience . what beautifully crafted , artistically amazing , poignant study two young japanese students encouraging one follow their dreams they surprise themselves falling love . professional artist , i amazed superb quality artistry background panels , each one alone separate masterpiece , 3 dimensional feel movement/action . this not what i expected . most striking element this masterpiece ( risk trite ) slice modern japanese life/culture it imparted me . characters real , while same time decent , moral kids . there certain innocence characters totally refreshing endearing . they projected almost spiritual reverence their elders total respect their teachers . because japanese culture shown " user friendly " , their parents no fear their kids traveling bikes rapid transit throughout tokyo . it quite charming follow various characters through their daily activities reminded me my own childhood before our american culture became so dangerous . i now own many miyazaki films including porco rosso , kiki delivery service , princess mononoke , spirited away , castle sky , few others . however , my personal favorite still whisper heart . i can't wait introduce my nieces nephews these fantastic beautiful stories .	1
i liked this film alot agree most positive comments ( some negative .. swings remind me shock aka beyond door ii ) . my comment/question bit spoiler those who haven't seen it . it seems me ' infection ' metaphor medical malpractice it begins apathy lack caring patients . ending , upon re-watching it , i notice head nurse who returns gets ' infected ' when she doesn't want sign patient . ( clipboard scene ) . other medic ( emt ? ) insists so she finally signs it . seems doom her . that what i got film , i dig j-horror but much it cultural that what makes it so interesting . i lucky see ju two asian women who explained tons stuff i never would've understood so i'm sure there lots i didn't ' get ' infection .	1

" mothman prophecies " one most underrated contemporary horror films i've ever seen . i only saw this once awhile ago , but i remember amazed movie this good could swept under rug it seemingly . richard gere ( yeah , i know ) plays washington post reporter named john klein who loses his wife very curious car accident . after accident which purposely filmed so we don't know how or why it really happened , his terminally damaged wife starts drawing really weird pictures moth . she keeps asking klein if he saw this bird sorts or not , kind dracula-like figure two eyes too bright make one comfortable . first he insists he saw nothing but keeps pictures , childlike chilling images playing perennial part film later . patton best actor this movie . he plays gordon smallwood , outwardly small town nut actually man driven insane bizarre enigma this innocuous little town unknowingly houses . when klein shows up gordon house ( rifle shoved his face ) , it not accident . nothing this movie really . way pellington shoots scenes gordon losing his mind unforgettable -- it happens fizzy , weird video game type way which comes off very vividly . i've never liked laura linney too much always felt she belongs tv but she decent job connie mills , local sherrif who basically serves dramatic witness klein breakdowns real star movie -- indrid cold -- keeps calling him . only " exorcist " or " black christmas " , perhaps , i seen movie before which creepy , otherworldly voice becomes star . even when klein tries escape his obsession tear out jack phone , it keeps ringing ringing . this exercise derangement strange form hope . climax strike some impressive others senseless . bottom line : every horror fan should see this .	1

thornton , . . ( writer ) ( 1996 ) . sling blade . . meistrich ( producer ) . usa : criterion collection . thornton plays lead role carl , developmentally disabled ( autistic ? ) man his 40s who spent most his life small-town texas resident psychiatric hospital . his crime double homicide his mother her teenaged lover . we also learn his father mother him bury infant brother immediately after his birth while still alive . carl , whose heart seeking purity justice but whose mind not equipped deal well evil world , released hospital after 25 years becomes friends frank ( black ) , 12-year-old boy whose mother , linda ( canerday ) , hooked up abusive alcoholic boyfriend , doyle ( yoakam ) , whom she hopes go away his own accord . linda best friend her grocery store boss , vaughan ( ritter ) , who gay who stays small town he finds oppressive largely because his love linda frank but also because his own fears inability deal larger world . carl relationship frank father-protector figure grows , doyle becomes more threatening everyone safety , carl makes decision protect frank linda murdering doyle . when asked fellow resident ( walsh ) what world outside like , carl says simply it too big . this beautifully made movie struggle good evil its major concern development safety frank , young boy . carl enters this fallen world discover mother who suffering battered wife syndrome can't act way protect her son . vaughan , other good adult , equally incapable helping frank . his own part , frank despises doyle but too young helpless anything except seek protection carl . carl , portrayed thornton , idiot savant who masterful repairing small engines , equally adept providing shelter frank , who comes rely carl he would his own nurturing father . carl displays many characteristics servant leadership delineated spears ( greenleaf , beazley , beggs , spears , 2003 , pp . 16-19 ) , notably listening , empathizing , healing , his effect other players equally remarkable servant-leader terms . example , one scene portrays dinner vaughan holds his house frank , linda , carl , his boyfriend albert ( tim holder ) , developmentally disabled grocery store worker melinda ( christy ward ) whom vaughan matchmaking carl . scene understated contemplative its vignette community building , wry humor reveals fact everyone store knows vaughan albert lovers , which vaughan thought secret , echoing movie theme world " too big " - too callous mean-spirited sensitive people live unharmed lives . carl also displays qualities foresight commitment growth people his relationship frank . this ultimately leads him conclude only way frank grow up undamaged , implication doyle may actually become drunkenly enraged kill linda frank . carl ends up killing doyle act premeditated sacrifice dark it gets . he acts frank protector but also returns himself contrastingly small world mental hospital , where he spends most his time sitting chair , looking out window . there much more detail nuance this movie i can't capture couple paragraphs , but movie melancholy deep well worth watching . get some more flavor it , see http://imdb.com/title/tt0117666/quotes few pages dialogue excerpts	1

i love this movie . zombies , yakuza , samurai , possibly even vampire ( i think that what main villian ) crazy monkey yakuza man who pulls guns , literally , out his arse . what there not love ? i think whoever called " kung fu evil dead " most accurate description movie i could possibly imagine . plus , little knocks movie makes " matrix " really funny . however , i must warn you . not watch it english-dubbed ! it worst dubbing i ever heard . i owned this dvd months before girl i over wanted see it , but didn't want read subtitles . i am convinced there only two actors doing all voices english version . seriously , every male sounds like it same guy trying different voices . only worse english-dubbing i've ever heard dutch version " ichi killer , " but , least , funny how bad it sounds . also , r-rated version , which i saw first , actually cuts some important stuff out film . i rented r-rated version then bought special edition there two or three scenes i like , " ooooh ! so that why happened ! " seriously , they butchered film r-rated version . but if you like slightly campy , ultra-violent , let throw every idea we ever into one film type-movies , go it	1
watched this movie no less than 20 times . love it everytime i watch it .... just love sandra bullock , when you mix it harry conack you can't beat it . you love it if you romantic heart !!	1
intent director capture atmosphere or " flavor " elizabethan court . intrigue , alliances , deceit , ambitions , trechery emotions . addition he means show us elizabeth human thrust into power , all power demands . those points he got it right although people not quite clean good looking then . times brutal . toothache could kill you . lice everywhere . those who criticize historical accuracy complaints miss point . historically accurate film would span very very many hours or even more . movie probably could little longer it . worthy multiple viewings	1
i see lot positive reviews posted here ... historical luther not found this movie . no doubt audience predominantly lutheran . secular entertainment point view , i would agree them . 4 stars . attention detail excellent ; it well acted , well written , well casted . however , director eric till made luther into hero . he no hero . history reveals truth so glaringly absent film . only thing rang true luther anti-establishment , religious zealot reformer , just like jesus , ( only jesus hated gentiles , calling them " dogs swine ) . " i challenge till make " luther part 2 , " using excerpts luther own words below script . it smack hitler biography/// . disclaimer : if you lutheran , brace yourself . he blatently advocated slow genocide jews . hitler picked up what luther throwin ' down ... " jewish vermin ... shall their homes razed ... curfews set ... business banned ... " etc . this luther never portrayed . ad hominem or not , how lutheranism trusted when it founder such hateful individual ? jews their lies , martin luther " i made up my mind write no more either jews or against them . but since i learned these miserable accursed people not cease lure themselves even us , , christians , i published this little book , so i might found among those who opposed such poisonous activities jews who warned christians their guard against them . i would not believed christian could duped jews into taking their exile wretchedness upon himself . however , devil god world , wherever god word absent he easy task , not only weak but also strong . may god help us . amen . he not call them abraham children , but " brood vipers " [ matt . 3:7 ] . oh , too insulting noble blood race israel , they declared , " he demon ' [ matt 11:18 ] . our lord also calls them " brood vipers " ; furthermore john 8 [: 39 , 44 ] he states : " if you abraham children ye would what abraham .... you your father devil . it intolerable them hear they not abraham but devil children , nor they bear hear this today . therefore blind jews truly stupid fools ... now just behold these miserable , blind , senseless people . ... their blindness arrogance solid iron mountain . learn this , dear christian , what you doing if you permit blind jews mislead you . then saying truly apply , " when blind man leads blind man , both fall into pit " [ cf . luke 6:39 ] . you cannot learn anything them except how misunderstand divine commandments ... therefore your guard against jews , knowing wherever they their synagogues , nothing found but den devils which sheer self-glory , conceit , lies , blasphemy , defaming god men practiced most maliciously veheming his eyes them . moreover , they nothing but thieves robbers who daily eat no morsel wear no thread clothing which they not stolen pilfered us means their accursed usury . thus they live day day , together wife child , theft robbery , arch-thieves robbers , most impenitent security . however , they not acquired perfect mastery art lying ; they lie so clumsily ineptly anyone who just little observant easily detect it . but us christians they stand terrifying example god wrath . if i refute all other articles jewish faith , i should obliged write against them much long time they used inventing their lies -- , longer than two thousand years . ... christ his word hardly recognized because great vermin human ordinances . however , let this suffice time their lies against doctrine or faith . i not tell you earlier jew such noble , precious jewel god all angels dance when he farts ? alas , it cannot anything but terrible wrath god which permits anyone sink into such abysmal , devilish , hellish , insane baseness , envy , arrogance . if i avenge myself devil himself i should unable wish him such evil misfortune god wrath inflicts jews , compelling them lie blaspheme so monstrously , violation their own conscience . anyway , they their reward constantly giving god lie . no , one should toss out these lazy rogues seat their pants . ... but then eject them forever this country . , we heard , god anger them so intense gentle mercy only tend make them worse worse , while sharp mercy reform them but little . therefore , any case , away them ! over above we let them get rich our sweat blood , while we remain poor they suck marrow our bones . i brief , dear princes lords , those you who jews under your rule -- if my counsel not please your , find better advice , so you we all rid unbearable , devilish burden jews , lest we become guilty sharers before god lies , blasphemy , defamation , curses which mad jews indulge so freely wantonly against person our lord jesus christ , this dear mother , all christians , all authority , ourselves . not grant them protection , safe-conduct , or communion us .... . this faithful counsel warning i wish cleanse exonerate my conscience . let government deal them this respect , i suggested . but whether government acts or not , let everyone least guided his own conscience form himself definition or image jew . however , we must avoid confirming them their wanton lying , slandering , cursing , defaming . nor dare we make ourselves partners their devilish ranting raving shielding protecting them , giving them food , drink , shelter , or other neighborly acts . therefore we christians , turn , obliged not tolerate their wanton conscious blasphemy . accordingly , it must dare not considered trifling matter but most serious one seek counsel against this save our souls jews , , devil eternal death . what shall we christians this rejected condemned people , jews ? since they live among us , we dare not tolerate their conduct , now we aware their lying reviling blaspheming . if we , we become sharers their lies , cursing blaspemy . thus we cannot extinguish unquenchable fire divine wrath , which prophets speak , nor we convert jews . prayer fear god we must practice sharp mercy see whether we might save least few glowing flames . we dare not avenge ourselves . vengeance thousand times worse than we could wish them already them throat . i shall give you my sincere advice : first set fire their synagogues or schools bury cover dirt whatever not burn , so no man ever again see stone or cinder them . this honor our lord christendom , so god might see we christians , not condone or knowingly tolerate such public lying , cursing , blaspheming his son his christians . whatever we tolerated past unknowingly - i myself unaware it - pardoned god . but if we , now we informed , protect shield such house jews , existing right before our very nose , which they lie , blaspheme , curse , vilify , defame christ us ( heard above ) , it would same if we doing all this even worse ourselves , we very well know . second , i advise their houses also razed destroyed . they pursue them same aims their synagogues . instead they might lodged under roof or barn , like gypsies . this bring home them they not masters our country , they boast , but they living exile captivity , they incessantly wail lament us before god . third , i advise all their prayer books talmudic writings , which such idolatry , lies , cursing blasphemy taught , taken them ... fourth , i advise their rabbis forbidden teach henceforth pain loss life limb . they justly forfeited right such office holding poor jews captive saying moses ( deuteronomy 17 [: 10 ff . ]) which he commands them obey their teachers penalty death , although moses clearly adds : " what they teach you accord law lord . " those villains ignore . they wantonly employ poor people obedience contrary law lord infuse them this poison , cursing , blasphemy . same way pope also held us captive declaration matthew 16 [: 18 ] , " you peter , " etc ., inducing us believe all lies deceptions issued his devilish mind . he not teach accord word god , therefore he forfeited right teach . fifth , i advise safe-conduct highways abolished completely jews . they no business countryside , since they not lords , officials , tradesmen , or like . let they stay home ... sixth , i advise usury prohibited them , all cash treasure silver gold taken them put aside safekeeping . reason such measure , said above , they no other means earning livelihood than usury , it they stolen robbed us all they possess . such money should now used no other way than following : whenever jew sincerely converted , he should handed one hundred , two hundred , or three hundred florins , personal circumstances may suggest . this he could set himself up some occupation support his poor wife children , maintenance old or feeble . such evil gains cursed if they not put use god blessing good worthy cause . seventh , i commend putting flail , ax , hoe , spade , distaff , or spindle into hands young , strong jews jewesses letting them earn their bread sweat their brow , imposed children adam ( gen 3 [: 19 ]} . it not fitting they should let us accursed goyim toil sweat our faces while they , holy people , idle away their time behind stove , feasting farting , top all , boasting blasphemously their lordship over christians means our sweat . no , one should toss out these lazy rogues seat their pants . but what happen even if we burn down jews ' synagogues forbid them publicly praise god , pray , teach , utter god name ? they still keep doing it secret . if we know they doing this secret , it same if they doing it publicly . our knowledge their secret doings our toleration them implies they not secret after all thus our conscience encumbered it before god . accordingly , it must dare not considered trifling matter but most serious one seek counsel against this save our souls jews , , devil eternal death . my advice , i said earlier , : first , their synagogues burned down , all who able toss sulphur pitch ; it would good if someone could also throw some hellfire . would demonstrate god our serious resolve evidence all world it ignorance we tolerated such houses , which jews reviled god , our dear creator father , his son most shamefully up till now but we now given them their due reward . i wish i ask our rulers who jewish subjects exercise sharp mercy toward these wretched people , suggested above , see whether this might not help ( though it doubtful ) . they must act like good physician who , when gangrene set , proceeds without mercy cut , saw , burn flesh , veins , bone , marrow . such procedure must also followed this instance . burn down their synagogues , forbid all i enumerated earlier , force them work , deal harshly them , moses wilderness , slaying three thousand lest whole people perish . they surely not know what they doing ; moreover , people possessed , they not wish know it , hear it , or learn it . there it would wrong merciful confirm them their conduct . if this not help we must drive them out like mad dogs , so we not become partakers their abominable blasphemy all their other vices thus merit god wrath damned them . i my duty . now let everyone see his . i am exonerated . " my essay , i hope , furnish christian ( who any case no desire become jew ) enough material not only defend himself against blind , venomous jews , but also become foe jews ' malice , lying , cursing , understand not only their belief false but they surely possessed all devils . may christ , our dear lord , convert them mercifully preserve us steadfastly immovably knowledge him , which eternal life .

i took look first dvd this series after reading malcolm gladwell books , harford " undercover economist " , " freakonomics " , " long tail " . i didn't expect too much , then ended up devouring all six hours . my education economics almost entirely summarized books above , so overview economic history , i found this series terrific . three disc , six hour long public televsion documentary , series very comprehensive one hundred or so years it covers . considering i slept through my one college economics class , i also surprised find it entertaining its " battle ideas " take economics its demonstrations success failure many nations under many economic systems . i don't think it produced accomodate political agenda everyone watching it ; six hours quite enough . because pbs produced " commanding heights " , i honestly expected it six hour screed evils walmart foreign labor . it actually quite opposite ; demonstration how free , competitive markets very limited regulation provide best overall economic conditions while government controlled markets lead empty stores bread lines . mixed economies work only short term solutions booms busts completely unregulated free compeitition . not really " laissez faire " economics , but very discriminative use government regulation create best economic conditions --" hold loosely " economics , maybe . very loosely , probably . whole series nutshell me . series also presents interesting view how world leadership works way you'll never see presidential documentary or six o'clock news . when your decisions affect hundreds millions , you use best ideas , presented best minds careful not your decision swayed dogmatic screamers who only point out problems , but never present well planned solutions . however , screamers essential . leadership decisions far always correct . disc 3 , when one attendees wto conference asked where he would 25 years earlier , he answered he'd outside protesting . now , he felt real solutions inside . labor leader interviewed said it wasn't job protesters solutions , but check power letting failings power known . three cheers both those answers i think . it role leaders come up best plan they think possible public let their dissatisfaction known via their right protest . i see thomas jefferson loving whole idea . there interesting stories told documentary : how milton friedman professors chicago school economics recruited around world their ideas implemented save national economies ; how economists called help win polish revolution ; how margaret thacher took out friedrich von hayek book free market economies out meeting tossed it table ; how von hayek wait until his old age until his theories embraced ; how richard nixon other conservatives abandoned their posts free market economics watched things get worse . i also learned one problems free trade ( other than exportation domestic jobs ) not so much low wages paid foreign countries , but how many these countries don't grant their citizens property rights , so even if their overall conditions improve , they never prosper because they can't really make claim anything they own . it seems their could definitely some simple policy decisions made there would improve things . one wonder why they not made .	1

i bought this without previously knowing anything it , not knowing it sequel . i taken title , blurb . that it . it sounded like really romantic film , one i might identify , i've always wondered what would happen if i met my first love again , if i would same feelings . after watching very , very long trailer , i slightly disappointed , i only managed half hour into film , before i started doze off . it so incredibly boring ! although i wouldn't say i normally mind " real time " films , it all set mid-late afternoon , very dull time day if you ask me . it only time day director richard linklater would shoot scenes film . he felt it added reality film , often relied actors get perfect takes right time , it shows , it shot mere 15 days . but it nothing but talk meandering around parisian streets parts i watched . i just didn't identify it . nothing happened . i hated two actors . i don't normally like ethan hawke anyway , but i thought i might able ignore this , but no i disliked julie delpy too . i wouldn't recommend this film anyone , although i know other reviewers gonna disagree me , but it just wasn't what i expected .	-1

friend once who snickered my enthusiasm this movie . brainless cretin described it " chick flick " i give him long winded explanation why he once more way off beam . " goodwill hunting " classic guy movie guys who guy things . above all other story elements , this movie boyhood friends uncompromising loyalty those friendships . there scenes here should make you miss buddies you turned age , those great friends who there when you your first drink , chased your first skirt got into your first bar brawl . hunting genius becomes crux film . he genius , yes . but mostly , he young man typical frustrations misgivings come age . he issues girls , issues law , issues his own place world . this quickly became one my all-time favorites because it movie endless depth substance . story young punk criminal record outshining rest mathematical minds compelling start . so attempt bedraggled but committed psychiatrist reach boy weird friendship forms them . south boston serves beautiful shabby backdrop hunting feels himself drifting away his buddies his genius gets more attention world universities prestige he unfamiliar . he wants continue working construction hanging out seedy bars his friends , rather than his fluke ability exploited men greedy ambitions concerns over petty things like tenure . matt damon stellar streetwise hunting , orphan attitude . robin williams leaves his goofiness behind plays aging psychiatrist who once tough young man just like kid he trying help . while praising pair , no one should overlook talents ben affleck , who credible actor before he started landing tabloid covers . relationship damon affleck powerful . latter knows his childhood friend bound great things prods him achieve silent , macho way good friends .

" fake-news " tv movie already , better , ten years ealier " special bulletin " . where first movie took its subject , nuclear disarmament terrorism , seriously , this cheese-fest doesn't respect viewers ' intelligence all . they pull every heartstring throw every cheap trick they think camera . not it ties together any coherent way " make love not war " ending reeks junior-high-school sophistry	-1
i'm good friend haskell wexler , edited his film , " medium cool , " 1968 . this film came out year before required viewing all us -- especially because way it made scripted story look like documentary . i loved film back then but hadn't seen it again until last week . i admit i bit worried it would appear dated irrelevant . quite contrary ! given events since 9/11 , iraq , madrid , london , lebanon -- west global struggle against islam -- this film more important relevant today than ever . there one sequence particular which three arab women disguise themselves europeans order slip bombs past french colonial checkpoints plant them locations where they kill maximum number europeans . i won't spoil extraordinary suspense this sequence telling you whether or not they succeed . they not suicide bombers , but they place their deadly packages they look around people they kill . it simply one best pieces pure cinema ever	1

this season always special me because it one got my hooked survivor first place . i doing class project 8th grade , working it while my parents watching this television , i instantly intrigued . so while africa first season i watched its entire span , it end australia got me hooked show . i thrilled when this dvd came out because i could finally see entire season , i not disappointed . even though i didn't see whole thing television when it originally aired like i every season since africa , this still one my favorites , right after pearl islands . this perhaps most memorable cast entire series thus far , first , memorable female villain , jerri manthey , chef who couldn't cook rice , keith famie , sweet duo elisabeth rodger ( former who currently co-host view ) many others . this season also produced most all-stars , five total , more than any other season . winner also one my favorites series . buy this dvd experience wonder australian outback yourself . i promise you won't disappointed .	1
i never heard this film before i saw it sale target . fan johnny depp , i picked up last copy store under ten bucks . film opens , i thought , " well , i guess there reason why movies you've never heard go sale . " but , even i thought this , there still quality this film captivated me . even though pacing slow first , images dialogue seamed saying , " if you pay attention , i'm pretty important . " luckily , little voice right , film picked up steam it moved . now , not misunderstand me : no point this fast paced film . rather , your interest taken captive pieces dialogue imagery give film near-deat dream-like quality . more you see film , more you think you may understand , but , same time , more dream-like it becomes . others bemoaned grotesque portrayals supporting roles , yet this , too , leaves you sense maybe all not it seems . film draws close , nothing concrete laid into your lap . there no nice tidy " explain it all me so i understand this totality " wrap-up . no , instead , you free allow your mind wander questions reality , death , dreams , fate . weren't we told all , even opening train ride , this how things would progress ? william blake dead ? this actual william blake ? this exactly we saw , just incredibly cruel descent into fateful end ? film begs , perfect , multiple viewings . enjoy it every time	1
this film really spectacular . very opening(which slightly disorienting-but becomes clear quickly ) , it weaves tale filled some very odd fascinating characters . nicholson plays radio deejay sorts spouts some fictionalized , but engrossingly told tales . story itself deals his visit his brother-played bruce dern , who he must attempt talk out some financial scheming . dern turns fine performance-comparable his performance smile(very different characters , both great performances ) . ellen burstyn also terrific . photography laszlo kovacs ranks up his best . welcome follow-up rafelson five easy pieces(a follow-up doesn't get press it deserves ) . looks beautiful dvd	1
trevor ( osment ) good kid living hard life . he constantly taking care himself while his single mother ( helen hunt , pitch perfect ) works job after job he continually battle her her alcohol problem , she hides bottles he finds drains them . this story mother-son relationship heart ' pay it forward ' , actual paying it forward ( school project trevor comes up ) many ways sub-plot here , not other way around . you see , trevor bright young boy ( 11 or so ) whose new teacher ( kevin spacey , always brilliant ) gives them ' beginning year ' assignment come up way change world , better . he doesn't feel any kids actually come up anything substantial , but then again he never student quite like trevor . trevor comes up plan , utopian idea ( now look up :p ) where one person something good 3 people who turn something good 3 more people , never same people , always someone different , idea , rediculous it may sound actually worked word it got out reached struggling news reporter ( jay mohr ) who decides story trevor his idea . like i said , all this nothing more than sub-plot . heart soul this story bond forms these 3 unlikely souls . mother whose always trying so hard right thing but life her can't make right choices . teacher who afraid change fear hurting anymore than he already boy caught middle heart gold . your story what touching moving story it . helen hunt top her game this beautiful story learning love , kevin spacey , always brilliant , convincing heart breaking his sicerity . young haley joel osment brilliant young actor i'm sure , promise he showed movies like this one , a.i. his oscar nominated performance sixth sense , he come back guns blazing once he through awkward stages those teenage years ! great film oscar ignored , but thats nothing new it ?	1

" it through these eyes , figuratively speaking ( lieut . werner not speak us or speak over film ) , we taken journey through atlantic stormy waters , its depths . i've gone ride over dozens times thus far enjoyed this film each viewing . concerning 3 versions available : if you're movie night some friends want enjoyable action adventure --- very realistic depth charge explosives rocking this german sub ( well your living room , if you surround sound system especially ) then original version suit you well . this shortest version rather fast pace wherein something always happening threatening nature , either sub itself or convoy freighters germans attempting sink . director cut , contrast , 50% longer , such , somewhat slower pace ; this complete uncut version initially broadcast germany almost 6 hour mini-series . ( incidentially , first 2 versions simply edited versions latter one . ) owing its lenth , i understand how one would prefer one abbreviated versions ( i sometimes watch director cut this reason myself ) , but when i want really get immersed ( pardon pun ) this story i reach this uncut version . this version it far easier feel aboard this sub we watch crew , like lieutenent werner , absorbing eyes ; they come alive go attack , race assume battle stations , rally face death save their craft when attacked themselves , or slumber/write/eat/sing/daydream home . one gets lot more latter activities this uncut version , giving us closest experience most us ever get aboard submarine . lighting , realism , acting , dialogue , direction , you name it , everything this film consistantly superior any other war film i've seen ; most other dramas well . it , short , one finest efforts presented film . i hope i some help herein persuading you consider seeing this motion picture its full-lenth , most effective , form . ( unless you're 100% allergic subtitles i recommend viewing director uncut versions original german ; preferably otherwise quiet eve , dark , if you want get full import this absorbing film . ) cheers !	1
this surely one most seriously underrated mystery thrillers around , which shame since director sam raimi , just before hitting jackpot " spider-man " franchise , assembled wildly improbable cast inhabit admittedly lurid though constantly involving 2001 movie . i town southernmost tip chile when i first saw this movie hotel room which just happen hbo . not even outside splendor midnight sun could tear me away watching movie tv set back then . co-written billy bob thornton ( upon whose mother psychic gifts story based ) tom epperson , plot revolves around disappearance jessica starlet , daughter wealthy resident georgia backwater town . tired blind alleys , police begrudgingly recruit annie wilson , single mother three sons , who lost her husband factory accident now earn living tarot reading psychic/fortune teller . annie thinks she finds suspect donnie barksdale , abusive , white-trash husband one her most devoted customers , valerie . complicating matters annie her attraction wayne collins , her eldest son teacher jessica fiancee ; buddy cole , annie customers , suicidal mechanic traumatized parental abuse he received child . while it not perfectly constructed , sometimes excessive screenplay contains lot layers but remains true characters ' voices motivations throughout . raimi expert direction full sumptuous southern gothic visuals genuine tension escalates over course story . credit needs given jamie anderson cinematography neil spisak production design establishing such heady atmosphere perfect labyrinth plot . some actors really surprised me strong turns , including katie holmes spoiled , baby-faced debutante jessica ; greg kinnear seemingly stalwart wayne ; keanu reeves especially visceral chilling unrepentant wife-beater donnie ; giovanni ribisi deeply troubled buddy . smallish role valerie , hilary swank makes her moments count she cringes donnie scarifying dominance over her . but it wondrous cate blanchett who pulls it all together her multi-dimensional performance annie . convincing southern accent , she reveals hidden layers her character beautifully she tries recover loss her husband , protect her children make sense psychic revelations traumatize her us . dvd short extras - fifteen-minute featurette which includes cast crew interviews , movie trailer video neko case " furniture room lullaby " which perfectly reflects haunting soundtrack . definitely seek this one out if you looking atmospheric , character-driven thriller not condescend viewer	1
i got my set august 9 delighted it . i remember show it origional run back early 70 , but i'd forgotten many details shows made them fun . dennis weaver really cool mccloud , sw myself , i like seeing virtuous western lawman hold his own ny finest . scenes shot nyc fascinating me i've never visited . one episode unfinished second tower world trade center very visible beside one finished time . i enjoyed seeing familiar faces actors i'd seen other universal shows , especially very young randolph mantooth , vince howard , james mceachin , raul julia , gregory sierra , just name few . j.d. cannon also perfect long suffering chief clifford . i also like terry carter mcclouds sometimes reluctant partner , but i loved wry barbs sgt . thatcher , ( james mceachin ) mccloud exchanged disposal man episode . dvds sharp clear , captioning nice , i enjoy this type show so much more than modern cop shows , i recommend it highly , especially first two seasons this set	1

" broken flowers " realistic movie explosions , gun fights , car chases . real life nobody acts like this or talks like this . that not say movie realistic good , but it helps if somebody least resembles human . bill murray meets up old girlfriends he hasn't seen 20 years , these meetings ridiculous . real life people show more emotion or some type reaction , they usually talk . this movie they just sit there stare each other almost nothing say . why this interesting ? it torture . when they finally talk , everything said random vague . reality people try carry normal conversation . even strangest people it , i've seen it . people say director jim jarmusch takes " minimalist " approach . nothing " spelled out you " , you " think " . " if you don't get it , watch your explosions movie " . it reminds me modern abstract painting , one blank white canvas except orange square . people rave it deep meaning it hanging met . meanwhile i paint orange square blank canvas . so you . i also make this movie , just give me some cameras , cinematographer some money . while watching , my head i filling dialogue characters , my dialogue lot more interesting than anything these people say . i enjoyed bill murray " lost translation " . his deap-pan performance worked there . least movie characters something say , stuff happened . here we long shots bill murray laying couch , or just simply staring into space . looong shots . only character vaguely resembled human winston , bill murray neighbor . he somehwat amusing he actually talked ! i don't need movies mirror reality enjoy them , nor i need everything spelled out me . my favorite type painting impressionism , which looks nothing like reality if you stare it . but right perspective good one looks more realistic than photorealistic painting . this movie , orange square nothing but orange square , people staring into space nothing but people staring into space	-1

i remember when " willow " first came out big screen . i remember how cool it watch skull-helmeted general kael ride onto screen . i loved swordplay madmartigan . trolls creepiest things i've ever seen . flash forward twenty-eight years , " willow " lost some its luster . it doesn't appeal me much it when i youngster . however , it still great film watch your family . those uneducated , " willow " tale one willow ufgood , little man who stumbles upon child " giant " person . this particular child bears mark which proclaims her person who eventually overthrow evil powerful queen bavmorda . bavmorda sent out her warriors murder every baby kingdom until she finds one mark . when dog-like beasts attack willow nelwyn village , he instructed take child give her first daikini he finds . this where madmartigan enters scenery . he mildly agrees help willow his quest , but things eventually turn into one great escape after . climactic battle good evil inevitable . willow played warwick davis . fans horror know him leprechaun " leprechaun " films . fans sci-fi know him playing wicket , ewok friend princess leia " return jedi . " he also provided body marvin " hitchhiker guide galaxy . " rest cast built up huge future stars , little legends , established character actors . billy barty bit role nelwyn village wizard . val kilmer portrays madmartigan , slightly oafish , very deadly swordsman who aids willow his quest . everyone should know kilmer . he tons films " real genius " " island dr. moreau " his legendary turn doc holliday " tombstone . " jean marsh portrays bavmorda , , much like reviewer stated , she seems channeling evil queens older disney flicks . joanne whalley ( sorsha ) pat roach ( kael ) round out very reliable cas t.t he special effects look very dated compared today films . however , it should stated this film early pioneer modern special effects . there even documentary dvd explaining beginnings " morphing . " overall , this film aged relatively well far family film . it rather violent moments , but it overall safe film watch your kids long they handle violence level films such 80 fantasy fest , " krull . " i don't recall much bad language all , but warned there quite few deaths this film , impaling swords eaten very " rancor " monster-like two-headed dragon . you'll also notice number references bible , " lord rings " books . if you grew up this film i , you'll probably enjoy memories film . however , it rather boring times adults . i'd still add it my collection if i you , if no other reason but enjoy it your own children see amazement their eyes once sparkled yours .	1

my gosh , this not what i expected i am so glad . these kids weren't unidimensional nerds their parents weren't obsessed tyrants . course kids smarter more goal oriented than most , but they balanced lives . i liked everyone this movie -- every parent , every child , filmmakers ... everyone	1
it hard know where begin this one . movie immaculately filmed one greatest directors all time , given just most perfect presentation i've ever seen dvd . i guess i'll start print : it magnificent , beautiful , golden colors , sharp focus , barely speck dust film . one would expect kurosawa film , composition feast eyes , beautiful formal balances coming most mundane elements shot . ( george lucas very influenced kurosawa many ways , but this sort beautiful , balanced composition one thing he never mastered . ) then there score . most people might not immediately think score when discussing kurosawa film , but i struck here how powerful distinctive it , while same time it never gets way film . then there sets : simple , yet used maximum effect . this not big budget film hollywood standards ( though it most expensive japanese film up time ) , but it feels far more epic than any recent , very expensive star wars " prequels , " which just goes show it takes more make epic than just money . kurosawa reportedly only used something like 200 horsemen , yet you'll think you're seeing far more . then there cast . tatsuya nakadai , lord ichimonji , manages perfectly portray man going man who both frightening his stubbornness sympathetic his pathos same time . not easy job , especially under ton makeup made him look far older than he . three sons , played akira terao , jinpachi nezu especially daisuke ryu ( insightful loyal saburo ) distinctive well-developed . androgynous peter ( first name billed only ) kyoami memorable his flamboyant , almost drag-queen gyrations taunting aging , increasingly senile warlord insights into his predicament . yet standout performance , one i always remember , stunning mieko harada lady kaede . while ran supposedly loose retelling king lear , kaede more lady macbeth than anything else . she two very memorable scenes both involve severed heads . while screenplay riffs lear , it also makes some notable changes . three daughters replaced three sons . this " lear " goes mad not because daughter love but because , apparently , weight wars fought past . young lord very odds image we see beginning film , man wishing make peace his demons . we discover through backstory he killed , kidnapped waged much violence bring together his kingdom , yet now he just wants peace goodwill . i thinking adage what goes around comes around , wondered if hidetora himself ever came this realization . it what he thinking he emerged burning castle after tremendous battle , dazed , wordless ? scene , shot without ambient sound but haunting score ( composed toru takemitsu ) , must go down one greatest moments film , example how cinema used way no other art form . bonus features both bountiful meaningful . first there full-length commentary film scholar stephen prince , though i confess i've not yet listened it . director sidney lumet gives brief appreciation kurosawa ran . he likens film late beethoven quartets or seventh symphony . such comparisons often come off glib or meaningless , but this actually struck chord me . i indeed think comparison ran energies seventh apt , introspection reminds me late quartets , particularly op . 132 . second disc , we a.k. , 75 minute documentary kurosawa life . ( case you've seen recent pbs documentary kurosawa , this one different . ) then comes half hour film making ran , which shows what grueling shoot it must , going every day base mount fuji often working there even night . finally there 35-minute video piece exploring costumes ran , well new video interview tatsuya nakadai ( lord hidetora ) . there also color booklet interviews kurosawa composer takemitsu . short , there enough supplementary materials here keep any fan movie or director happy weeks . many criterion releases defined what dvds , but this title just takes cake . what more could one ask , short summoning kurosawa beyond talk film ? even if you own ran one its other video versions , they all vastly inferior this release . if you've never seen film , or any work akira kurosawa , this probably best place you could start . highly highly recommended	1

acting : forget it . story : ludacrous . however production design ( sets , puppet , killer mechanisms ) cinematography worth mentioning - although i tell you now stylish overall look this film seem awfully dated dozen years . i'm giving this film 2 stars : one efforts production design team , other one shared marketing heads studio , editor who cut one hell good trailer together graphic designer(s ) who responsible layouts all promo material .	-1

those us old enough seen holbrook his one-man twain show 1960 , owned original cast recordings " mark twain tonight " " encore : more mark twain tonight " know this 1967 television version featured second-rate material . yet second-rate twain still better than most comic/philosophical writing . ( there also original cast recording this show released . ) now there cd columbia legacy called " mark twain tonight " which combines some producer idea best each three older records . i would picked some different bits if i task , but overall pretty good well worth money . since this dvd only thing available showing holbrook twain when hal still young , playing mark age 70 , it . if you real twain fan , or real fan one-person stage offerings , this should your collection ... but get cd also , before it goes out print , some even better material . tv show , one mistake spending too many 90 minutes more " serious " side twain --- anti-war social criticism aspect his works . don't sit down watch this expect it all laughs , all time	1

i first saw this movie sixties , when its expose rome decadent jet set still some shock value . four decades later , when mating habits movie stars endlessly dissected across globe , trials tribulations sweet life feel numbingly familiar . what left story marcello , ( marcello mastroianni ) gossip columnist , what happens him during series loosely structured night wanderings . trailing marcello through rome , we learn his character discern his fate . he aspired once intellectual , idealizes his friend steiner , imagining steiner life perfect blend serious purpose family warmth . what happens steiner provides movie only true emotional shock . marcello traveling salesman father shows up unexpectedly rome . marcello wants him stay longer so they get know each other better . but , after raucous evening town , old man bolts once again . we see source marcello emotional guardedness . this guardedness affects his romantic relationships . there emma , his steady girlfriend , who wants commitment he unwilling provide . he dallies instead movie stars , such sylvia ( anita ekberg , whose zaftig charms show us how much standards cinematic beauty changed over forty years . ) his most interesting relationship maddelena ( anouk aimee ) decadent aristocrat . there definitely chemistry them , but neither them put aside their party masks long enough explore it . his most moving encounter young girl country , waitress seaside resort . jaded marcello drawn her innocence optimism , because it takes him back his younger self , fresh arrival big city . movie end , after debauched night , he sees this girl beach dawn , standing other side channel . she shouts him , gestures , but wind snatches away her words . he can't connect her . shrugging , he turns back his bleary-eyed troupe nightlifers . this rich movie , its energetic inventions keep you hooked , even though it almost three hours long . you would expect one cinema world masters , there lot artful filmmaking here - innovative night photography , playful musical score brilliant nino rota , arresting visuals , such opening shot statue jesus airlifted helicopter over city . many fellini major preoccupations display well . his nostalgia simple , natural life country played out marcello interactions young waitress . carnival italian catholicism brought hilariously life when two young children claim visions virgin mary way jerking chains their elders . adults , desperate miracle , swarm site . marcello paparazzi could care less , long there enough spectacle squeeze out story or visual . pretensions urban intellectuals wittily skewered during party scene steiner where bombastic people talk past each other several languages . some most appealing aspects fellini movies aren't all evident la dolce vita . his warmth towards his characters , instance . starlets , aristocrats tabloid journalists marcello runs aren't very likable . without his easy charm , this would cold movie indeed . also , fellini best there using cinematic imagery create dreamlike flow his stories . but this movie full abrupt , even awkward transitions , though fellini , following marcello through warren rome streets , keeps hitting dead ends which force him back up order go forward . although fellini starting move away his neorealistic roots la dolce vita , he doesn't move very far . when he finally returned those roots , he made amarcord , amazing fusion realism surrealism . me , it fellini best movie , perhaps one greatest movies ever made . la dolce vita isn't good amarcord , much its shock value diluted time , but it worth seeing mastroianni seemingly effortless virtuosity privilege watching great director capture passing parade .	1

this movie loads fun ! it truly " little engine could " ! it easy point finger knock down points film because it low budget stuff , but there really isn't much room so this one . sideline secrets takes few seeds manages plant entire orchard . what i am saying fact this film best what it end it comes out true winner . actors great . i think we seeing some them bigger projects near future they clearly passion comfort what they . story very dark . it touches upon lot controversial subject matter involving molestation , rape , physical abuse , alcoholism , more . but , dont get too frightened , although much subject matter serious , movie knows how tie it all into somewhat complicated yet very entertaining story . romantic story core nice see . i am glad see movies like this climbing charts . it reached #2 bestseller spot popular online retail store . me it no wonder why . sideline secrets truly gem found many .	1
review disclaimer : my review based vhs release , anticipation this deluxe edition dvd , released october 24 , 2006 . whenever i think this movie , i get chills followed imagined warm heat . this movie fire . actors , passion , plot , settings . everything . everything ! i recommend this anyone older than 18 . it great classic holds its own , any audience ! this movie everything i love ! great plot ! passion ! sex ! beautiful women ! william hurt shines . i honestly thought , when i saw this movie , william hurt would go classic hollywood actor , picking up all types roles we've seen mel gibson , bruce willis , tom hanks picked up , over past 25 years . while mr. hurt resigned himself lesser known roles , smaller parts ; certainly non-hollywood roles . seeing this film , first time , young people ( old , matter ) might re-introduced this fine actor , showing them what many us enjoyed 25 years ago . some my favorite memorable scenes : chair through window ; ted danson peter lowenstein dancing moonlight ; windchimes matty porch ; hot florida nights ; ned racine ( william hurt ) realization scamed ; etc . if any movie , over past 25 years , most deserving sequel , or pre-quel , this it . i don't want spoil anything , but watch this movie , tell me if you don't agree , this movie deserves follow up story . not really " cliff-hanger " but it leaves you longing more . yet , still very satisfying . great movie ! mc white said : check it out !!	1
i bought this only because i loved first one , hoping it wasn't terrible second . after i watched it i so impressed . first all i loved it really didn't anything first , aside cassidy katherine cousin , sharing same last name ( there only one reference katherine sebastian beginning ) . it much better than different actors playing old characters , which drags movie down alot . i thought story great , good twists . whole cast very attractive , which can't hurt either . " bad " characters all pretty likeable , aside one , all well end . best thing this movie character cassidy . i sarted out hating her , ended up really liking her her realness , honesty she not try hide she b*tch . this actress particularly good job , pulling off both loveable , complete brat same time . i would definetly reccomend this movie .	1
saint ralph perfect movie hand entertaining houseguests or cheering someone up , since most folks haven't already seen it , it uplifting , it wide appeal ( sports , coming-of-age , dramatic storyline , funny ) . much this movie humor misunderstanding . ralph , 9th grader , gets lot wrong , perhaps since he so little guidance , his war hero father dead , his hospitalized mom entering coma , living unsupervised home faking headmaster he staying grandparents . plus , he got more typical 14-year-old problems , he object ridicule classmates can't control his hormones . after little pool incident , headmaster attempts resolve ralph horny " energy surplus " problem sentencing him cross-country team . after his coach says , " let go , 180 days left til boston marathon , " ralph asks running it , coach says he kidding , anyone team winning it would " miracle rival loaves fishes . " taken literally nurses statement it'd take miracle his mom recover , scrawny , smoker ralph then sets out win boston miracle , defiance opposition headmaster . ralph gets misguided ( comedic ) instruction out-of-date books how train fellow student ( aspiring nun/crush-interest ) requirements producing miracle . despite catholic setting , this not religious movie , secularists could easily point out ralph theology all confused movie hard work good intentions , while believers might see it picturing god responsiveness sincere , crying hearts , even if our theology not all formulated rightly . artistically , movie wonderful well , acting impeccable music fitting . ebert roeper right applying what usually cliche , " beautiful gem . " won awards toronto , palm springs , seatle . ( brief poolhouse backside nudity , some taking lord name vain . neither gratuitous .	1

all i say wow . i heard this series good but monumental understatement . this series deep . this not funny , fun series . this series full suspence , action drama beginning end . you begin yuji , learn how survive world infested giant bugs called blue , whose sole purpose destroy humanity . he meets marlene , emotionless soldier who cares nothing but getting mission completed no matter cost . story continues , there many fantasic episodes some you won't like but they benefit whole story amazing way . each episode leaves you wanting see next one . episode 26 finishes series absolutly shocking way . i'm not going spoil it anyone but you see it . you see other 25 episodes first or it won't make any sense . believe me , you won't all disappointed buying this series . this series box set also comes blue gender movie : warrior . this only downside this box set . movie sucks . if you watch it before series it might good but after movie really sucks . it just retelling series condensed form few changes . i didn't like it but you might different opinion . overall , i give this series five stars because it really earned them . i also liked dvd case like book . all you put it your shelf . buy this series if you want see amazing anime	1

" predator " one my favorite science-fiction thrillers starring arnold schwarzenegger . when i first saw this film i thought it going formulaic sci-fi film . it not . idea group hardened american commando stalked hunted down like prey alien world terrific . scenes where predator hunting them outstanding . i liked everything film , not nit-pick any flaws . when commando wipe up guerilla fighter jungle , if this just cake walk them , you don't expect what awaiting them . what awaiting them one hell awesome enemy . when jesse ventura carrying his mini-gun , you get impression there more than one predator , maybe even quite few , however film predator , not predator(s ) . when it begins take out team ease you just know your'e one heck ride . especially ease which predator takes them out . this chameleon type predator not your typical alien . this one manhunt -- literally . film highly recommended . it one wild ride great suspenseful film . i can't understand why critics blasted it when it released . thrill factor incredible . highly recommended .

night iguana always my favorite films based tennessee williams plays it great see it this sharp clean dvd . film belongs john huston much it williams that no bad thing . huston transfers play screen sympathy , empathy respect its characters , dilemmas , - most all - its lyricism . like play , film engages mind well emotions we discover bits ourselves nearly all characters . huston always good director actors here he brings out best uniformly excellent if disparate cast . richard burton , still his prime , gives one his best screen performances - acting his entire body soul instead just letting his expressive eyes wonderful voice doing all work . perhaps huston knew just how push right buttons , or perhaps script location inspired him . or maybe he simply responded sparks other cast members . ava gardner quite magnificent role finally lets her act instead mere decoration . her earthy portrayal middle-aged widow seems take her back her southern roots she displays her character wide range raw emotions just right mixture abandon self-control . against dynamic duo burton gardner , debroah kerr wisely underplays her part vaguely artistic new england spinster , getting maximum effect most subtle inflections her voice thoughtful half-pauses . such company , sue lyon fight hold her own so much through costuming she acting . but easily matching stars film grayson hall repressed decidedly butch leader group women whose burton character taking guided tour mexico . her performance more layers than initially apparent , if i remember correctly , earned hall oscar nomination . just side comment previous reviewer who went out his way criticize cyril delevanti portrayal 97 year old poet grandfather kerr character . this person obviously very little experience either old people or poetry . delevanti performance good anyone else film produces its genuinely touching moments . if i concentrated mostly actors it because night iguana such character-driven work . elements such photography , sound , music etc . good because they nothing detract performances or wonderful dialogue . only possibly distraction location but then mexico becomes almost character itself . extras dvd show just how important location film , yet decision film black white remains correct one . it draws us much closer into world rev . . lawrence shannon his temptors tormentors . brilliant film stood up well over years one i never tire seeing . new dvd makes it look good new adds couple interesting , if brief , extras . definitely classic	1

we seen so many films , documentaries , photo essays it difficult accept this particular film all happened accident . likely hood two film makers , cameras loaded ready , driven tragic event real life heros victims still unbelieveable even though i first saw this historical footage few years back . it not documentary , it real time life happening ( like security camera ) before viewers eyes . must see .	1
hyperbole won't seem appropriate most people , but me this single most un-enjoyable movie i've ever seen , ever . every aspect it painful . first , production values : this movie just ugly . i guess biological computers supposed novel or deep concept , but it just disgusting really very poor looking . times i thought they just rooted through medical examiner dumpster gather props . i understand you can't really nice props low-budget movie , but setting technology so central plot you think they could've paid decent production designer . everyone says this not " special effects " movie ideas behind it what counts , but plenty low budget movies didn't look this bad able convey something new . acting : just one thing sea annoyances here jude law accent . it terrible , he lets his native one slip several times . it distracting sloppy . dialogue just bad overall , so i blame writer most this . this movie not " misunderstood . " it objectively bad movie . it unentertaining , boring , scrabbling significance only scraggly-bearded philosophy majors care dogmatize . lot reviews said it better see it black comedy , but this movie only unintentionally funny , if all . i'd give it zero stars if i could , i'm trying warn people away this turd	-1
this dvd set i've waiting all these years ! i've mash fan since 1972 , this ultimate dvd collection . all elevan seasons , including goodbye , farewell amen . also includes feature turn off laugh track , reportedly , cast never liked laugh track . hours special features like mash 30th anniversary show much more ! you view scenes not broadcast television over 20 years due editing commercial time . blooper feature short length , packaging needs alot space store , but this well worth price . only way this could better if alan alda delivered it personally .	1
i remember enjoying this when i rented it quite some time ago . i thought some street conversations little off didn't feel right , but i impressed over all . i writing review ' company ' trying figure out why i kept thinking there something wrong picture . it this film , actually . blockbuster rental very dark overly saturated ntsc . however , i remember adjusting my nec studio monitor just this dvd quite shaken how much dynamic range they'd squeezed into it ... more than usually possible ntsc . picture mastering seemed geared more playback pro equipment , rather than neutral one home . either they didn't use ntsc-calibrated monitor , or something like general gamma value botched before master sent duplication ... maybe just moved decimal point . it hassle compensate this playback end , but odd way almost worth it such film-like curve probably wouldn't possible otherwise . not necessarily bad thing , but it worth pointing out it might not look right your screen . i'm not sure if newer pressings different .	1

one major problems i encounter people who viewed this cinematic masterpiece kurosawa film pretentious boring . more importantly , truth readily available viewer if he or she just watches film . however , point film . what truth ! we viewer foreknowledge crime criminal charged . " rashomon " always one my favorite films akira kurosawa , although i not place it top five his greatest . but kurosawa fascinating insight into truth dares us look what we hold " truth . " there any absolute truths ? if so , whose ? this film attempts let viewer decide who telling truth . relativism , [ corollary skepticism ] truth or belief truth relative position person who making statement . which turn directly questions ideal objectivity : since this undermines belief people get outside themselves order get truth . therefore , if truth depends observer viewpoint , how there universal truth -- or even absolute truth ? i believe kurosawa attempting show audience although truth may not absolute , there still truths . therefore , even though each characters kurosawa thrown into this film give us different viewpoint truth they witnessed it , individual themselves give enough their perception [ through their own objectivity ] , which truth still found . kurosawa so wonderful way giving four different versions murder rape : one witness , three versions people involved crime . me , film telling many ways , some which i am sure i am wrong , however , film fascinating way kurosawa uses non-verbal area film : visuals themselves . many kurosawa films , cinematography all talking . much gathered this film just looking scenery , trying not focus too much dialogue ; visuals themselves much , if not more , story . who telling truth ? why there different versions ? this i leave others decide themselves . film , attempt get truth really fascinating . telling sign kurosawa knew what he doing especially evident when looking reviewers amazon disagreeing each other . kurosawa what he set out : what truth ? toshiro mifune bandit who charged crime , he terrific acting job . movie also stars great takashi shimura woodsman who discovers scene crime . this classic highly recommended . however , it may not appeal all viewers . rent it first . [ i own it ] but since this film foreign , ambiguous many areas , some viewers may problems it . [ stars : 4.5	1

i found this outstanding miniseries it shame westerns like this few far ... westerns such great format showing our country its heritage . frankly , lonesome dove it americana . character interaction duvall jones makes this film masterpiece it . viewers , we drawn into lives two lifelong fiends entering twilight years their lives . former rangers , they tamed sw border territory together . then disillusioned , spent their best years personal purgatory lonesome dove ... where their only source amusement getting drunk , getting laid town only prostitute or stealing horses across border . feats valor forgotten , their self-respect diminished , they realize life opportunity passed them bye . both become determined confront death one last time . what occurs this film keen examination love two aging men , both agreeing make cattle drive montana setup ranch ..... perilous feat worth recapturing their youth self respect .... but reality , journey which they both hope not return . many us follow same path , friendships so old close one cannot easily discards one obligation other . this common thread rivets us screen . we brought into relationship call mccrea garner what meaning friendship two men who known each other so long . i cannot think any film adequately exposed this quality among men so well except lonesome dove	1
i realize others may think this just fluffy little disney sequel , but i thought princess diaries 2 beautiful film sequel worthy acclaim first movie . anne hathaway returned big screen witty , beautiful , albeit klutzy mia thermopolis . her performance never faltered , i very glad she able return role . julie andrews everlasting beauty , royal gem film industry , i pleased hear her lovely singing voice surprised so many this film . callum blue chris pine both breaths fresh air , their roles this film , i'm sure , sent many girls ' hearts aflutter . their futures movie-making sure bright after their tender , heartwarming roles competing suitors princess mia affections . wardrobe sets this film eye-catching lavish , drawing viewers cozy little village feel genovia . i applaud disney their successful efforts wonderful film , hope many people see this film appreciate it i . me , it great sequel great movie , all cast crew should very proud . anne hathaway beautiful , talented actress , who thankfully hasn't fallen prey emaciated lifestyle so many other actresses . she looks behaves like real young woman today	1
numerous historical inaccurracies already outlined other reviews . political correctness post cold war jingoism maquerading hindsight blame this farce war movie . some historic elements ( like stalin " not one step back " order , etc ) haphazardly crammed into few opening scenes , creating anachronistic mess . unfortunately , there aren't many soviet perspective films stalingrad choose . would recommend this film those looking simple suspenseful -- if predictable -- entertainment novelty war movie that not " usual " u.s. or german wwii perspective . would not recommend it anyone interested historical accuracy or complex original plotlines	-1
i saw this twice during its too brief(one week ! )run seattle 1987 i always showing it people later video who thought i insane , which may or may not beside point , but this one those movies , like big trouble little china , inform you someones personal sense humor taste . either you get it or you don't . i think this movie some kind psychopathic classic perfectly sends up extreme amorality spaghetti westerns prefigures homicidal men black suits later turn up pulp fiction reservoir dogs . few films top it sheer nihilistic rip-it-apart glee . i am glad it finally seen dvd its original aspect ratio , because theaters it very carefully staged widescreen compositions which lost video . cast uniformly weird wonderful : sy richardson , channeling pure self-righteous macho bad-ass blackness , joe strummer , showing surprisingly light touch comedy , dick rude , hilariously channeling psycho-punk james cagney , courtney love ( hang there , girl ! )gives truly committed performance shrill whining nancy spungen monster , pogues almost manage say their dialog , elvis costello doesn't much dialog but acquits himself well . i could go rest cast , there plenty them still mention , including especially miguel sandover , who greatest clint eastwood send-up i ever pleasure watching . watch this film ... you'll either get it ... or you won't . i laughed like hell .	1
i agree some comments robin williams went little over top this otherwise well-meaning sweet film . message film much stronger than messenger though , i found it very humane inspiring vehicle williams ' talents . very fine supporting cast . philip seymour hoffman patch prig roommate , monica potter his skeptical ( first ) love interest especially , fellow who plays truman ( tall , lanky fellow glasses ) provided comic relief ( robin williams ! quite feat ! ) . children film all real patients , they added sense realism urgency film deep abiding message compassion . this collector edition many bonus features . one i loved most shadyac commentary . you see he mission this film , you also learn lot his influences . he funny robin williams , maybe even crazy	1

one thing i always liked series murderous culprits always " uber-successful " much lose not committing crime . course , statement not my endorsement murder means end ; it just cool see those people we think " it all " resort doing away their fellow man ( or woman ) . this third season dvd compilation shares same double-sided disc format previous second season collection . unfortunately , it includes installment kate mulgrew lamentable " mrs. columbo . " though show came after these " columbo " episodes , it looks more dated , filming techniques , well awful scoring writing . fortunately , actress , she would achieve greater success " captain janeway " " star trek : voyager . " " columbo " episodes , other hand , some best show entire run . vera miles , actress i long admired , gets glamorously chew scenery likes vincent price young martin sheen wickedly delicious " lovely but lethal " . film veteran donald pleasance hams it up marvelously snooty winemaker " liquidates " his younger half-brother ( gary conway " land giants " ) cleverly titled " any old port storm " . this episode also features vito scotti , friend star peter falk appeared many " columbo " over years , including " swan song " , also among this compilation . " candidate crime " former child star jackie cooper plays politician saddled less-than-desirable campaign manager decides put permanent end their political relationship . robert culp , one television best actors , returns third time perpetrator " double exposure , " also featuring robert middleton louise latham . oscar winner jose ferrer stars possibly " weakest " episodes , " mind over mayhem , " though it features sly tribute steven spielberg , director first episode show . also , guest star roster includes screen veteran lew ayres ( theatrical " dr. kildare " series ) young jessica walter ( " arrested development " ) . but most ingenious use guest stars writing belong " publish or perish , " previously mentioned " swan song , " " friend deed " . jack cassidy , fine actor appeared several episodes , first , again playing someone publishing field , he spielberg-directed " murder book . " " swan song " stars underrated actor johnny cash country gospel singer . film star television directing legend ida lupino plays his shrewish wife . finally , broadway veteran richard kiley gets most inspired role all , playing columbo police commissioner boss murders his wife . composer billy goldenberg would provide most brilliant scores third season . this stellar season , marred universal decision include " mrs. columbo " failure offer any other extras dvd buyers come expect	1
comedy ? thriller ? suspense ? i guess these all words or genres you could use describe this film . i would use these words if i wanted gloss over true feeling this film . i would use these words if i sell this wallow-some film distributor who didn't know any better . i would use these words lightly , because if i ever believed them battle would forever lost . this not comedy . it not thriller . it definitely not suspense . so , what it ? after viewing this film i came conclusion january man reminded me puzzle put together two-year-old . while all pieces box put together , sadly infant size brain child chose smash pieces together instead place them corresponding orders . thus , you jumbled mess wedged pieces what could overall beautiful picture . poor acting , confusing plot literally went nowhere ending felt forced premature , one see this puzzle unfixable even best puzzler world . if i those involved creation , i would definitely ashamed . begin , what wrong actors ? nobody seemed like they giving 10% much less 50% their effort this film . even great ones like keitel , kline , sarandon felt like they walking through motions equally confused eyes hearts . kline new york accent faded out throughout film giving us no glimpse his actual character . his role never fully defined , so other half time we watch him screen we just don't care him all . this one worst leading characters all time . thankfully , completely miscast team seemed more interested money than actually " acting " backs him up . keitel horrible this film . i am huge fan his body work , but this one he walked , talked , gave those emotionless eyes rest . he provided nothing value this production . same said sarandon , whose character seemed unfocused undervalued , mary elizabeth mastrantonio , who never really got her feet wet hollywood until maid marion arrived her doorstep . alan rickman wasted , well one-leveled voices danny aiello rod steiger whose only direction pat o'conner yell . other words , if you interested seeing this film acting , you greatly disappointed . second , perhaps acting overlooked strong story line ? wrong ! this most convoluted script i ever seen hollywood produce . we spend first forty minutes learning event happened two years ago never fully explained anyway . it reminded those times teacher would say class we should all listen up because this wasn't going test . then why bother . this set spiraling downfall rest film . this unavailable information also lead some pretty choppy chemistry actors . i never say kline keitel brothers . i never saw relationship sarandon possible . fact , now i think it , i didn't see any actors meshing well together because they working script focused all wrong parts . eventually , january man gets so caught up this secondary story we find ourselves rushed into ending solution seems laughable instead plausible . we even villain so confusing i don't even think he knew what he doing film . final thirty minutes this film worst parts this movie , second all parts before . whoever wrote this script must just forgotten basic rules storytelling because nothing meshed well all . finally , i would comment marketing this film could feel like cheated ticket some filmgoers . after reading some reviews this film , i expecting find myself chuckling out loud antics kevin kline his spin world investigation . i wrong . there no humor this film all . even when o'conner tried bring some , it seemed forced unhealthy . i must repeat , this not comedy . it even isn't really suspenseful , nor thrilling aspect actually thrilling . i must admit whomever sold this film company under guise it comedy should awarded " best salesman decade " award . somebody believed this film funny even pasted preview it word " comedy " written all over it . someone sold company broken product ... hook , line , sinker . i just ask you beware . overall , this film horrible . poor acting , cryptic story needed some form decoder ring understand , passionless actors , harshly branded word " comedy " , january man proves not all films should made advanced screen process should used regularly . i genuinely encourage you skip this film . no good come you watching this mess . i promise . grade : * out ****	-1
" koma " surprisingly suspenseful film . while there enough gore certainly warrant horror flick categorization , director chi-leung law delivers very old school hitchcock suspense tale . close-ups objects like foot dragging across floor leaving bloodstained trail heighten suspense move story . angelica lee fung chi-ching , girl who needs new kidney inhibitions keep her fully embracing her boyfriend , good job hits many levels hysteria jealousy drunken delirium . andy hui who plays her boyfriend , dr. tsui wai-man , hits number levels also guy love man whose hormones outpace his common sense . researcher suen ling , karena lam projects person who difficult upbringing frequently not walks shady side street . twists plot trace kidney thief who black-markets organs $ 60,000 pop never leaves you quite settled until final frame . subtitled chinese dialog often sparsely verbal picture translates well international audience . " koma " turns out pleasant , often intelligent , surprise . enjoy !	1

movie begins welter confusion , but i guess all versions pride prejudice share problem sort out five ( this case four ) daughters avaricious greedy mother , plus best friend one them , so you all these girls " marriageable age " it takes little while realize who who . many noted , however , bride prejudice incomparable advantage luscious aishwarya rai , so you know right away she heroine . she like tall , much younger version vanessa williams , disgraced former miss america who made magnificent comeback singing star later her career . rai pipes don't power nor punch vanessa , but she something else , vulnerable frailty convinces us , even she plays meanest elizabeth bennet record , she really isn't bad she makes herself out . lalita gets annoyed darcy least little thing , we don't really understand why ( except general post-colonial reasons ) , point which we would really start dislike her if it weren't divine aish playing her . she so beautiful seems so warm , even when she playing hard get or positively spiteful . marsha mason simply no match aish , so contest never really takes off it might . why didn't they get real spitfire play lady catherine de bourgh part -- someone like kathleen turner ? or you know who would good -- jessye norman ! it stands , marsha mason looks like she'd rather somewhere else , perhaps eating dinners two or three her co-stars , than actually acting same movie them . one song , " show me way , take me love , " just gets better better each time it reprised , los angeles version surfers swaying their boards time beat , blue-robed gospel choir singers trailing darcy lalita across venice beach outstanding , worthy george sidney or stanley donen or vincente minnelli . martin henderson isn't very commanding playing darcy , but he'll pinch , movie makes most chemistry he evolves la rai , which last reel smoldering hot	1

i looked name ( groovaloos ) i looked cover -- my gut told me not get this dvd . i went against my gut believed reviews ; i wish i'd listened my gut . those you who think it looks sounds little hokey , you're right money . they all dance , but compared what i expected , they seemed mediocre . here lowdown : ( 1 ) sound sucks - they're city park you hear instructions fine , but music isn't loud enough really " feel " something makes you want move , ( 2 ) they just seem like group people who don't naturally rhythm , but they've learned some moves ; it so not inspiring , ( 3 ) it not edgy enough , ( 4 ) it looks good if you've got group doing it , but when someone doing it alone , it just okay . overall , this dvd okay , but not great . get it only if you're truly desperate	-1

edukators very interesting german film , directed hans weingartner , three young radicals whose ideals put test . we first observe them taking part fairly commonplace demonstrations against global trade . these people , however , who determined take things beyond level protest . jan peter friends who break into homes affluent people , instead stealing anything , simply rearrange furniture other items . they leave calling card message , " your days plenty numbered , " sign it " edukators . " premise itself fascinating leads some humorous scenes well provoking thought . humor comes seeing absurd relocation objects , such putting stereo refrigerator . this , rather than conventional vandalism , kind performance art , meant create uneasiness self-examination part victims . while peter out town , his girlfriend jule jan spend time together become attracted each other . after jan introduces jule edukators ' tactics , jule convinces him help her " visit " home businessman whom she owes large sum money following car accident . man catches them they end up kidnapping him , bringing peter into action . rest film follows three friends they decide what their victim debate politics him . some these discussions interesting , though they inevitably follow predictable course ( " you parasite living off poor " vs . " i right what i earned , " paraphrase ) . businessman , however , moves arguing his captors sympathizing them , explaining he once radical himself . this real or merely ploy gain their trust ? romantic triangle further escalates tension . i liked intellectual content edukators ; it reminds us how few films today deal sympathetically characters who not only outside system , but actively oppose it . even better , movie not simply romanticize radicals demonize businessman . it actually raises more questions than it answers , which probably good thing . it not perfect film ; some situations seem bit contrived ( e.g. one them expert deactivating burglar alarms because he used work security company ) . ending more clever punchline than serious resolution matters . still , it very engaging well-acted puts new face old dilemma participating vs . fighting mainstream society .	1

" joy luck club , " my opinion close perfect movie i ever seen . i would not hesitate give it ten stars out possible ten . mostly chinese american cast absolutely superb their performances . my favorite character june , daughter suyuan . beginning movie , her friends family gathered together before she go china meet two sisters she not realize she until after her mother died . movie centers around four chinese women their daughters . experiences women china , apparently two world wars , often filled sorrow suffering . their stories told chinese english subtitles . experiences women china young girls young women strongly influenced how each them raised their daughters united states . i only couple quibbles this otherwise outstanding movie . one women , young females china during 1930 , occasionally unusually bold asserting themselves men who oppress them . while , feminist very strong believer completely equal rights based gender , i generally applaud most their actions , it not seem historically realistic given unfortunate pervasive second class citizenship chinese women during time period . " joy luck " great film all respects , peformances actresses , general storyline , cinematography music . this movie i watch over again , enjoying very much each occasion . ending this movie when june meets her two sisters , apparently shanghai , great scene very moving , one best endings any movie i ever seen .	1
i never fan boston celtics . i respected them , sure , but i could never see myself rooting them . all changed when i first bought nba video entitled " larry bird , basketball legend " way back 1991 . i just bought magic johnson one , wanted see his greatest rival . while i am slightly disappointed flow story am somewhat uncomfortable monotonous narration daniel stern ( hence 4 star rating ) , i safely say video what i not think possible : turn me into larry bird fan . then . fast forward recent history . when i saw amazon lbabl re-issued dvd form , i jumped chance get it . course , it helped lot classic larry games included ! pros : nice game selection . video itself moving . cons : where game 5 1991 eastern first round against indiana ? i think no game defined larry more than one . also , remember comments i made earlier ..	1
brood lightning bottle director david cronenberg never able duplicate . while all his films definitely his fingerprints all over them , brood managed rise top all his films . it absolutely dripping sense dispair dread . there pervading coldness it - such you want wrap up something warm you watch it - you want watch it lights because you're very much afraid what might there if you turn off lights . film psychological thriller wrapped slasher flick . it warrants slasher status simply because sheer number onscreen murders take place . this very bloody film ! samantha eggar nuts weird clinic people like her . she treated creepy oliver reed ( one his better performances ) . art hindle her ex husband he worried how she treating their young daughter . after while least his worries , these horribly disfigured ( what hell they ? ) bizarre little children run around killing all people really ticked off samantha eggar . i won't say more , because part horror cronenberg film pseudo-science he get you believe . whereas cronenberg videodrome weird , but not terribly good , brood one creepiest films i've ever seen guilty pleasure ( i really call it ? ) i choose subject myself every so often . really ! what those things ?	1

i saw this show live when it taped boston , i honestly say dane cook never ceases amaze me . it easy categorize his act simply catering towards obnoxious frat boys , but dane cook brought life back comedy his unique approach brilliant use words . not mention his delivery always spot . i grown tired typical simplistic humor sort become norm snl other " comedy " shows . but dane cook performances refreshing watch because he makes act what it ; only he could perform his act pull it off without looking like he trying too hard . he simply amazing comedian there reason why he named one time top 100 most influential people also one forbes ' top 100 celebrities . this dvd definitely worth buy . he uses his classic material previously released cd ( which never loses its hilariousness ) , but he also busts out lot new stuff just good , if not better . so buy dvd , see it theaters 11/27/06 if you , prepare yourself non-stop laughs . support guy because he awesome he adores his fans ! sufi !!	1
call me crazy ( most , anyway ) , but i absolutely adore this series . first your classic adventure flick , course , all romance , action comedy entails . second , my personal favorite , delves much further into story cranks up character development practically every major character ( i even cried imhotep one point . yeah ... you don't want get me started subject ) . since i'm such sucker sort thing , you bet i captivated . scorpion king , while not exactly mind-blowing , cool backstory previously sketchy character pure actiony fun . plus , mathayus kicks butt high style . :d box set itself really quite durable , though it might not look it first glance . interesting choice , making it out cardboard like , but it works nicely . extras such , i love running through these . fascinated ancient country early childhood , egyptology lessons nothing i didn't already know , but they make me grin all same . all all , there some lovely goodies this set , especially music videos tmr sk . mind you , i already own lot them vhs ( despite fact they're state my grandmother while i'm college ) , but we all know what happens those things after so many viewings . so yeah , i didn't think getting one my favorite series price one new release such bad thing . ps : guys , particularly brendan oded , great eye candy . rock arnold add their own flavor " hot , " too , which nothing complain this female . purely superficial thought , i know , not something i generally pay too much attention ... but frankly , it true	1
i sceptic most before seeing this movie . personally , i would rather watched funny flick . but once i saw first monster it started rocking my socks . plot line stray away but yet not too far original computer game . i would say this movie " based " game doom but not reenactment . most people probably expecting movie rekindle old memories computer game . one part movie makes you think actually game . but overall heads up , you disappointed . me i loved this movie just because action fight scenes . it really thrilled me . if you really don't care see game based movie least watch this one it sheer action . also , it makes you kind think ... would you turn into monster if you movie ? would you kill innocent people infected even if they could saved ? hahaha movie makes you think it cool aspect ! =p extras dvd aren't half bad either if you get two disc edition .	1

i never seen mr. show hbo before i got dvds they came out . like previous seasons , this one mix good bad stuff , lot more good than bad . there tight , smart pieces like prenatal beauty pageant life-raft talk show , but then there dragging , corny sketches like " date queen " . it evident commentary even bob , david , rest cast feel there some real clunkers just didn't work . other hand , bob often critical sketches work just fine , so maybe he just crack . there nice expansion cast this season . tom kenny doesn't show up much , but b.j. porter scott aukerman some hilarious roles . jay johnston also more prominent , he always funny . if you liked previous three seasons , this definitely worth picking up . writing , performing , production values best all mr. show seasons	1

i wonder if it says anything significant me i waited 10 years see this particular blockbuster . i mean , i always figured i'd get around this film some point , so i'm not total cinema snob distainer all things commercial . those clips white house getting zapped pretty attention grabbing back when i first saw previews back day . or just seeing those megalith space ships hovering over every major city world pretty darn ominous . so deep down , i always wanted check it out . but i guess i just never much rush . now critical analysis sorta my game , amazon reviewer notes above , independence day mostly pure fun movie -- not one many people going subject intense critical scrutiny . so why bother review it all ? this point , it available so many different formats probably all most consumers want know which right one them their player . they already know whether they want purchase it or not . reviewing film film may virtually pointless when most consumers likely only looking product review this point . well , what i say ? i'm critical analysis kind guy , so i really can't tell you merits digipak over double or single disk anniversary versions . tell you truth , i watched thing plain ol ' vhs -- i picked up sale , no less . but i still liked it , even without all dvd bells whistles . , yes , visuals stunning even this antiquated format . but just apercu or two . watching any film which iconic american buildings get zapped sky no longer innocent escapism it 1995 . i even winced seeing twin towers standing tall ( unharmed ) some early , pre-catastrophe scenes . we watch such things more jaded eye these days . or it more horrified stare ? escapist fare usually centered around big " what if . " these days , we pretty much know " what if . " before seeing this movie , i always wondered how well bill pullman ( actor i genuinely like ) would pull off presidential . he little too young ? little too callow ? cleverly enough , screenwriters made him struggling , almost failing commander chief , whose prior life hero pilot first gulf war may gotten him electec but left him ill prepared hardball politics . he presidential youthful john . kennedy/bill clinton kind way . unlike them , however , he not much political pro all . but also unlike kennedy , he still young able enough enter into actual battle once again himself -- ( many would opine)unlike clinton , he guts so . that something blockbuster films like play , isn't it -- our almost innate , primitive desire our leaders actual heroes ? course , we're just ( post-)modern enough want those heroes little bit flawed , say nothing bit conflicted . pullman all more . but there never any doubt he won't pull off his counter-offensive . he got cute newly motherless little tyke ( one who later showed up chicago hope ) take care , so he cannot allow himself fail . neither crazy crop-dusting pilot randy quaid , whose very family pretty much written him off loco loser . somehow quaid able inject some humanity some wit into his stock loser-who's-gonna-show-'em role . but still , there times when you find yourself mouthing his lines him wondering just how he pulled this off straight face . which you could also say rest cast well . these mostly very good , widely respected actors their work cut out them if they want move their characters all beyond level stereotype . funny thing , most them . mary mcdonnell suffers dies admirably . margaret colin stunning sassy presidential aide . her performance good enough you wonder why she never became " then next big thing " after all , i say this utter conviction , even though i must admit same time , i still keep mixing her up elizabeth perkins . face almost certain annihilation , she decides put aside her feud ( still devoted ) ex-hubby jeff goldblum . good thing too , since it goldblum character who figured out alien invaders weak spot . now all he needs ear president ... but how ? but how ? wait minute , i know ...! ok , so it bit cliched . but tongue cheek way , you understand . beauty latter-day sci-fi flicks their dazzling special effects so overwhelming you really don't want bothered much else . independence day , like so many other s-f films , wants come across 50s flick killer effects enough sly self-awareness so not appear hopelessly cornball . yeah , it just cornball enough . yeah , danged if it doesn't all work somehow .	1

they say you either love or hate this rather bizarre offering 1983 , but i found myself somewhat indifferent videodrome approached its conclusion . my mind , final third story ultimately too haphazard , esoteric , too consciously horror-driven clearly express themes worked into heart film . it easy read lot into this film , but that much credit viewer it filmmakers . still , videodrome certainly fascinating , unique film compels viewer contrast interplay video real life our increasingly technological age . 1983 , most people already seeing life through television screen - tv defined news , fashion , latest fads , etc . movie , tv plays integral part food comfort rehabilitation homeless taken cathode ray mission run dr. o'blivion ( jack creley ) . rather than paint television soul-draining maker brain-dead zombies , videodrome forges its way down even more frightening path , where television used potential weapon masses . james woods plays max renn , rather sleazy cable operator who depends shocking television shows keep his little station up running . he discovers many his shows through satellite piracy , just how videodrome first comes his attention . he fascinated show , which features nothing but torture abuse individuals , especially women , no sign plot anywhere behind it . it just kind shocking new thing he after , so he begins searching its source . his prurient interest such violent material enhanced his current girlfriend , nicki brand ( deborah harry ) , who so into sm she vows audition videodrome herself . before long , max begins hallucinating , his efforts discover source videodrome become , same time , desperate attempt maintain his sanity if not physical life . show isn't rotting his brain , but it physically changing it , therein lies unheralded danger this example reality tv taken extreme . all this works beautifully first hour , but i just feel psychology story ultimately sacrificed name horror , special effects force something disconnect viewer film . least my case , this robbed this otherwise perversely fascinating film much its power	1

if you fan kurosawa ( i am ) , then avoid this film all costs , there nothing more depressing than seeing once-great director , who revolutionized filmmaking examined powerful human themes , reduced making sentimental nonsense like " madadayo . " what monumental waste time this -- so unrealistically sentimental make one wince times . use near amateurs minor roles not help . this story ( such it ) retired teacher whose former students ( who all happen live nearby , apparently ) remain devoted him , sort christ-and-his-disciples relationship . they visit frequently , build him new home after war , hold lavish birthday parties him ( spend 30 minutes screen time helping him look his lost cat ) . what makes these students so devoted never explored all -- kurosawa just expects us take it fact . this leads painful conclusion " madadayo " depicts kurosawa idealization himself : kind old man inspiring continuing devotion his former proteges . " madadayo " also explains why beat takeshi others new generation talented japanese filmmakers become so disgusted kurosawa toward end his career . -- mellowmonk.co	-1

i intending see this documentary pretty much time it first came out until recently when i finally see it . i both pleased surprised it completely restricted itself analysis images appeared onscreen disappointed end not much really said any depth . so , i odd state relieved it not bad film like it chance ( delving into speculations sex lives famous hollywood personalities ) but it wasn't quite good i hope it would . i wondered beforehand if film would cover such topics frequent speculation cary grant randolph scott ( which there amazingly little evidence ; basis their lovers seems rest almost exclusively their roomed together many years ); rivalries cole porter set hollywood noel coward set ; efforts hide bi- , homo- , or pansexuality actors such errol flynn , robert taylor , laurence olivier , danny kaye , tyrone power ( all whom fact one three ); or proclivities various actresses . fact , there astonishingly little comment sexual orientations various people hollywood . instead , entire film deals almost exclusively images screen only screen . this , however , turns out far more interesting than voyeuristic plumbing sex lives stars . movie buff i , course , seen number obviously gay characters movies . joel cairo maltese falcon merely one better known . documentary its finest when it unearths many gay lesbian images films twenties , thirties , forties , fifties , decades which self-censorship limited what could shown movies . some these images familiar anyone who seen many films , such mrs. danvers rebecca ( those it should pointed out even it movie tremendously mutes lesbianism far more blatant novel ) . many others far less familiar . number scenes unmistakable homosexual scenes , i believe , surprise most people who seen lot movies . most interesting moment may when gore vidal admits he william wyler decided ben-hur messala lovers . stephen boyd informed this he acted his half relationship this mind , while wyler vidal decided not tell rather conservative heston any this . end , limiting discussion homosexuality images screen somewhat limited scope documentary . i'm not quite sure what ultimate point they trying make , unless it somewhat trivial one gays treated negatively movies , though improved somewhat recent years . not knowing what their ultimate goal film , i can't say whether they achieved it . still , despite ambiguity heart film what they trying accomplish , this remains very interesting film . it narrated lily tomlin . time its first presentation hbo story widely circulated she informally agreed come out closet time film first shown . last minute she seems change heart . she remains this day most poorly closeted person united states . me this points perhaps even more interesting story : way actors actresses directors stayed closeted over decades . every rupert everett ian mckellan there forty actors stay closeted . ongoing struggle maintaining public image while living very different life privately one i find fascinating . all all , this very good documentary . i definitely recommend it	1
... but i'm giving season four 4 stars , because there aren't any subtitles this set . they also didn't subtitles season 3 , but they subtitles seasons 1 2 . strange , huh ? however , quality dvds fine episodes , course , wonderful watch . end this season meathead supposed graduate move out good , but he decides stay bunkers little longer , so he get his masters degree . there aren't any special features or anything this dvd set , but long episodes uncut , i'm happy . if you're fan show , this dvd set must-have !	1

i generally like some these french-comic-books-turned-into-movies because they're usually pretty erotic . jane fonda role barbarella comes mind . this gwendoline series definitely potential what scantily-clad women-in-bondage theme scenes involving gwendoline her dominant girlfriend . but very beautiful tawney kitaen ( cast gwendoline ) apparently balked doing girl/girl scenes ( this 1984 , after all ) , so producers obligingly didn't force her any , result this one turned into very bland , weak , diluted version raiders lost ark . it not good adventure film , it certainly not erotic . there little nudity , some ridiculous moments supposed capture kinkiness french comics , but overall this one disappointing bust .	-1
i usually trust amazon reviewers movie reviews , but this time .... no way ! this silly , totally predictable film left us playing cat our evening entertainment , hoping movie would liven up . sadly , it didn't . those who rave film ... you must dimension or something . thumbs down .	-1
i just watched this movie last night . i came across title someone myspace jared leto fan i wanted watch it . i also read few reviews talked some people who said film riveting . riveting very least i say this film . it amazon editorial review puts it , " tour through hell . " this film makes you think . fact all addicts succumbed their addictions seems little out there me but i keep wondering it so far fetched . . . ? how many people there actually escape addictions ? you might escape one but more than likely you soon replace it . during film i kept trying see positive side it all hoping there some middle ground ; some little piece hope left . i wrong . film didn't depict drug use way i expected see it ; way i seen it depicted countless other films . all ugly aspects drug use put out there your viewing pleasure . personally i found it painful watch . there moments when i actually thought turning it off but some reason continued watch . i think reason hypnotic trancelike style film . truth i couldn't stop watching . film put me directly shoes addict . i felt like addicts film . . . my hands sweaty my heart pounding . i couldn't close my eyes . i want see it again sometime . i would like watch it my husband . i bought movie before i ever watched it first time . film painfully realistic , genuinely graphic , appalling appealing same exact time . must see . overall i think it wonderful film add any collection . personally it probably one best movies i ever watched . i think acting movie outstanding , direction genius , plot amazingly horrific . all all this 5 star film	1
remaking classic thankless undertaking , but peter jackson crafted film stands shoulder shoulder original . although he rarely mentions other films kong history , jackson taken elements not only 1933 original , but also delaurentiis remake , son kong , even king kong escapes forge epic film giant ape woman he loves . it these later films informs jackson take love story , human object gorilla affections comes love monster well . course this also brings " beauty beast " theme full circle , makes film ending even more tragic . many uninformed critics labelled this movie " jurrassic kong , " but clearly they not familiar amout dinosaurs populate original film . now expanded edition features even more prehistoric action sequences they real treat , particularly " log raft " sequence . this new edition well worth time expense , kong mini-statue cool bonus - get it now	1
it very difficult review this dvd give it correct stars . if you consider 2d version , it would get 4 or 5 stars animation colors wonderful very humorous story . but 3d version terrible . 3d worst ever , it never really produces 3d effect red/blue glasses dull changes colors making it almost black white film . none 3d effects really work . best them falling snow . often viewer sees two images ruining whole effect making it impossible concentrate story . recommendation forget 3d version just play 2d version . both disk . when 3d first introduced , people complained they got headaches 3d . this dvd definitely falls into catagory . perhaps imax gray poloroid glasses , effects work . not this disk	-1
feeding cat ... those girls shold put sweater . love this movie , 50 detective noir set 70 california . beach , hospital , mexico , supermarket , it all great - theme song keeps going throughout over over . final scene pays homage third man , beautiful . bit violence , but " that how i treat someone i love , i don't even like you " . never seen elliot gould movie i like more than this , it my favorite altman well	1

this dvd first season now-classic simpsons animated series , collects show first thirteen episodes . not much really needs said simpsons , it one biggest pop culture icons ever . however , you really tell these episodes series rough around edges when it started . character designs unrefined , animation crude rubbery . stories feel like typical sitcom plots little simpsons edginess zany humour tossed , but not nearly enough it . voice-actors also still getting into character here , so their performances also different what they later matured into . luckily , fox loaded first season dvd goodies , including commentaries every episode some other fun retrospective material . presentation really nice too some original packaging disc artwork . i'd say episodes themselves three stars , but superb box set treatment bumps overall score up four . if you're casual simpsons fan , season 2 much better place start watching , thats when memorable episodes really start coming . but hardcores , this set great buy , nice start your collection .	1

i can't possibly put into words how great war movie this , but it touched me deep inside . me , there little greater honor than serve one country , especially time unpopular war . i felt his film portrayed desire world warriors answer call duty honorable men , regardless side you fighting . perhaps one my favorite things this movie . albeit small part , time given " other " side we allowed glimpse enemy warriors . end , lt . col . moore paid homage , sense , enemy he fought . , course , actual footage moore shown extras ( bonuses must see ! ) praising his men -- nearly weeping he so . time when only reason people join service college money , servicemen scramble get out service when war comes , this movie reminds us we should much more grateful few serve dignity it because they americans love their country enough answer call when it comes . without these honorable warriors , there would no america	1
appreciate this story , you believe two people meet quickly fall forever into forbidden love . what heart this film . if you can't accept premise , movie simply not work . what makes it throb life me excellent performances jeremy northam jennifer ehle whose mutual passion sweeps us . paltrow eckhart secondary love story here , but you never feel they really care one . worth your time if you romantic . ok , i'm romantic . sue me	1
whatever ills world , it all fault corporations . that basic premise this terribly misguided one-sided totally non-objective movie . example , instead saying how terrible it companies paying people developing world peanuts their work , they forget these people alternatives even worse that why they took job first place ! these jobs provide them one few options they , if they chose job freely , it must their best option , no matter how crazy it seems us . people skills rise , opportunities increase over time ( more corporations not less , create more competition these people labor ) , country becomes wealthier , these people wages rise automaticaly fact , wages whole country average . there no shortcuts his . famous story comes nepal where anti-child labor laws , urging un , turned thousands kids overnight into prostitutes those jobs , sad it may , their best options avoid starvation feed their families . it slow process , but all industrialized nations went through process . government-mandated " shortcuts " usually produce results which even worse . however , results speak themselves : very short period time , example , hundrds millions people lifted out poverty china , india around world thanks " evil " capalism its corporations . no other system ever it so quickly past 15 years china india alone . also , cost living very low there , so these pennies really go long way , don't measure it cost living west . what filmmakers alternative they offer these people ? i guess let people starve death , then makers this movie don't anyting complain !? other examples stupidity include showing company like person who psychopath . corpoartion legal entity yes , may act like separate " " far law concerned , but corporation nose , feet , stomach ? it eat apples or sneeze or arthritis ? course , not , than how you attach human idea like psychopath it ?? several main " spokepersons " movie , chomsky , michael moore , rifkin others renowned their off-the-wall comments which frequently no basis any kind economics or reality . correct inaccuracies statements made these other people movie , you'd stop it every 5 minutes explain audience how profoundly wrong statements . throughout whole movie , you're basically bombarded one-sided arguments very little other side presented , despite director claim opposite 9they claim 1/2 1/2 , it more like 80%-20%) . just look chomsky comments how consumers so stupid , they don't realize all things they buy they don't really need . i mean we don't need fashionable clothes ( hey , let all dress boring chomsky ! ) , dvd players , or any new gadgets make life easier or more fun . who judge what you really need ? chomsky , course . he final arbiter what you really need or what you don't . you're too stupid know what you want , according him . he says you should " more important things " , like ... perhaps studying lingistics ( which he teaches but which very few care ) . movie make some correct good observations , especially regarding polution , however , i'd say 80% movie factually logically flawed . it also full economic fallacies . it worth watching i guess , just see how many errors one make just 1 movie . despite all ranting movie , it fails mention biggest reason most problems it brings up - too much governement interference every facet life . examples , how could government brazil forbit people collecting rain water ! how could u.s. government so many things private companies public funds ? just forbid governments playing favorites companies , forbid government corporate welfare any kind , forbid subsidies companies , cut suffocating red tape regulation ( esp . developing countries but west too ) , cut corporate taxes 5 or 10% ( see unemployment rate go almost nothing , give people all around world better life , increase competition , etc . ) if these other governments ( not corporations ' ) problems eliminated , vast majority all problems which movie brings up simply go away . interesing film anyone see how truth twisted mindless people agenda go back 15th century rural lifestile ( spoken much admiration ) , people no understanding economics , how world really works how really raise billions out poverty who this movie biggest disservice .	-1
worst movie ever made . i actually sat through whole thing hoping it would get better . acting beyond awful , story joke . i honestly blown away how terrible it , not waste your money or time this movie	-1
ladder 49 not type film i expected -- i hoping good , fast-paced action flick , which i got first 5 minutes . remainder 30 minutes i watched flashback rookie firefighter first days station . someone looking drama story growth firefighter would probably like this movie . however , those looking action should probably look elsewhere	-1
i huge fan . . montgomery work since i eleven-year old girl living caribbean . i've read re-read , re-read her stories again again , can't seem get enough . first two film installments anne green gables story warm , beautiful , funny , inspiring moving pieces work , more or less faithful montgomery original novels . third installment travesty . anachronism , bad dialogue , bad plot plain old bad acting plague this " sequel " . i say " sequel " quotes , because thing i dislike most movie fact storyline complete departure what montgomery envisioned anne so long ago . what way end i t.t hat said , i've decided purchase only first two installments , leave third alone . i prefer anne gilbert live out their literary lives my imagination , than poison my memory them drivel anne green gables : continuing story	-1
you'll get over it great film . film boy named vincent who everything going him riding smoothly . he great swimmer well school , people like him . vincent girlfriend noemie who very good him best pal stephane who also swim team . vincent however secretly dating bruno ( older man ) make excuses see bruno . while hanging out hallway his friends , vincent eye catches benjamin , new student . two lock eyes next time they cross paths again when vincent working . however , other people vincent swim team know benjamin gay they tell him stay away vincent . next day vincent outed graffiti school wall . film then vincent trying cope growing up now everyone school knows he gay . he come forth his girlfriend , his best friend , his family . i think story line extremely believable . it almost if you forget its movie if your looking into someone else life . it so powerful see what vincent going through new struggles he faces . julien baumgartner such good actor , he delivers great performance . he very intune character he playing able make vincent so dynamic so many emotions feelings . rest cast also good , roles they play vital film . i just can't tell you words how much i liked this film . i don't know if it because it french film . it definately artistic side you may not see so much american films . i also didn't mind reading subtitles , but rather enjoyed them . this film probably one best gay films i seen . i strongly think if you watch this you like it	1

i saw charlie chocolate factory last night first time ( i'm behind times , yes ) though i usually don't care very much giving my opinion , journey tim burton his team made me cross deserves homage . especially all criticism rising around film before it released . i tim burton fan more than decade now ; i grew up his films . but what i through yesterday his really unique . i actually never thought he would offer us such film one day . fans his first period , all lonely desperate characters won't like it sure . since mars attacks !, more specifically since big fish , burton decided tell things differently . his vision world slightly changed every his films : now , rejected freak comes down world stays . world remains frightening weird even thought we call it " reality " but world worth living . that what charlie chocolate factory all ... it all begins main title sequence may one main weaknesses film . sequence very entertaining visually ambitious but they decided go cgi it looks like it decision they made last minute . since film proudly made " real " sets , " real " oompas loompas , " real " squirrels , main title looks inappropriate . it not important but it tim burton film we know how much he usually works his main title . hopefully , danny elfman there crazy mix edward scissorhands spider-man ( music when title film appears gave me shivers ) , true musical roller-coaster gives hint what his score sound like through film . after , it just emotions . all kinds them : laughs ( many - audience laughed almost every thirty seconds ) , tears joy ( we all know charlie gonna find ticket but when he , you just can't refrain your heart beat faster ) , mercy ( way burton depicts social misery bucket family really touching ) , amazement ( wonka factory its many rooms true wonder , one most achieved design burton ever offered us ) many mores . very much like book , even though it seems simple childish , you would like stop second collect those feelings try analyze them but you don't time . it just never stops ( i realize it might flaw some people fact ) . burton never so generous terms human warmness . johnny depp proposes inventive completely wacky interpretation here . i won't compare gene wilder since i don't know first film very well ( pretty unknown flick here europe ) those comparisons should stop anyway . depp makes wonka tormented unadapted character who doesn't know much common courtesy doesn't really care anyway . he built up his own universe response his authoritarian father he pretty proud it . he just doesn't want those " weird " ( word he likes - you've all seen tv spots ) boring parents their despicable children ruin what life based . yet ... so depp wonka actually very moving pathetic his attempts entertain his visitors . burton everything he make you hate augustus , vercua , violet mike moment you first see them , you get instantly closer wonka when you noticed he feels same . addition , john august vision wonka past ( including always perfect cameo christopher lee ) offers character real depth you didn't expect . danny elfman also one main attractions film . while his score already classic burton/elfman work some interesting experiments ( main themes splendid ) , songs he wrote oompas loompas just so funny . hugh laughs audience some musical choices . those songs don't intend stay you months ( it would hard they're based dahl lyrics doesn't allow broadway impulses ) , they're just off-beat numbers playing many references so many styles . oingo boingo fans buy soundtrack when it'll come out , it'll bring them back 15 years ago . what , i tell you more ? mcdowell sets amazing , pescucci work impressive well rousselot beautiful cinematography . some oscar nominations should fall here . ending , without revealing it , august additions really touching fit perfectly burton new approach . even though final shot tempers " family " theme he developed through film ( it still burton , not disney ) , burton makes you feel good because he feels good ( what i'm writing here ring bell when you'll see movie ) . i don't know you but after so many distressed pessimistic films , it really moved see he found certain peace . charlie chocolate factory step forward direction he gave his career big fish . he lost his father , he became one , he getting older all those questions doubts expressed many important very complex images scenes he imagined film . that why i could call this film " edward scissorhands " his new period . those films very different but gave me both some very essential emotions . thank you , tim burton . thank you very much	1

this movie put josh hartnett acting map me . his earlier works easy enough avoid consider yourself lucky if you've able so . i hope this transition his part into better roles ; he entertaining . his quick-witted quips keep you laughing help you avoid need wonder what earth going movie . they fill you due time , even though i wouldn't surprised if you figure out ending before it unfolds ; you wouldn't first . it seemed little silly morgan freeman ben kingsley roles such these since they relatively small roles . but they definitely added big names draw attention movie more people should see . i feel like i should more say this movie , but i really sum it up saying i thoroughly enjoyed lucky # slevin .	1
no matter how old i get , i'll never too old enjoy good teen movie . yes , it rather formulaic , but 10 things i hate you smart funny more intelligent than your average teen comedy . it also stars julia styles , which definite plus my book . i can't say my high school anything like padua high ( how many high schools take place huge castle ? ) , i certainly never english teacher like one teaching here , but every high school pretty much same when it comes cliques , romances , misunderstandings , sibling rivalries , like . one things i really liked this film fact it didn't break down according overused formula rich kids vs . poor kids never twain shall meet ( unless you're , say , molly ringwald ) . it true this film loosely inspired shakespeare taming shrew , but don't make too much . how many teens would even know what shrew ? personally , i don't look kat stratford ( julia styles ) shrew ; she just bitter , disillusioned teen who can't stand thought doing what expected her - she reasons taking this persona . her sister bianca ( larisa oleynik ) her exact opposite , vivacious girl who just wants normal teenager . her problem girls ' overprotective father , who refuses let bianca date until kat starts dating ( which doesn't look like it happening any time soon given kat nature ) . new kid school , cameron ( joseph gordon-levitt ) , smitten bianca , he puts together plan make her date-eligible someone else take out her sister - ingeniously using school pitifully shallow cool guy ( bianca admirer ) middle man . chosen one school mysterious new tough guy , who earn money he paid win reluctant kat over . obviously , he ends up falling girl , which puts everything place predictable conclusion . kat designated dater become couple , or everything explode guy face ? bianca ever win right get out house spread her perkiness all around ? who bianca choose - hot , brainless mr. cool or cameron , nice boy who looks like he should still junior high ? , since she already taller than guy , bianca ever stop putting her hair up when she goes out him ? clichs abound , but script really rather witty . those keeping score home , film feature one wild dance party required minimum one barfing scene , but it never crosses line into completely dumb teen comedy . 10 things i hate you isn't quite good classic john hughes films 1980s , but it easily better than most teen films produced recent years . its pg-13 rating , it also teen movie suitable teens all ages - little table dancing racy this one gets	1

captioning valuable service provide those us who need it . film quot ; mirandaquot ; there no english closed-captioning track , only concession captions all track spanish . i noticed british efforts frequently released without captions , quot ; mirandaquot ; there usual modern faults : nearly inaudible whispering , inadequate separation dramatic lines accompanying music , british terms pronounciations which americans need hear more accurately , so forth . use spanish subtitles not help whatever these matters . otherwise , i believe christina ricci suitably admired photographer	-1
let me start saying modern horror movies don't scare me . this movie , 1990 , actually chilling ... there morbid fascination kept me watching . anyone who interested medicine whill most likely find this one fascinating well . , you get see julia roberts big hair left over 80 , that amusing	1
sitting down watch this film hige smile came across my face just ten minutes because once kevin klines charactor outed his now famous student kamden ( dillon ) movie doesn't let up . i haven't seen movie kept me laughing so much very long time . kevin kline plays english lit professor who , i mentioned , get outed his former student while accepting oscar playing gay charactor so heat moment decided dedicate award his professor " he gay " point ... hilarity ensues . you see , kevin kline engaged emily ( joan cusack scene stealing performance ) they due married just two days ... so those two days he needs figure out if he really gay . one surprising thing tom sellick who doesn't even look same without his mustache ( he actually much better looking should keep it off ) tom plays reporter who intent getting kevin out himself , admitt himself he really gay , all while poor emily isn't sure if there even going wedding . movie great start finish it touch some deeper subjects line gay tollerance acceptance our society . when kamden outs his professor you get irritated when priciple ( played perfectly bob newhart !!! ) warns him if he doesn't get married he'll lose his job . it sad see way our society treat something they don't agree . all all this ( tagline states ) out out comedy , out out good time	1
me , this film matt damon , brilliant newcomer who came out ( seemingly ) nowhere . i floored his performance - one best 20th century . course he supported fine cast - robin williams , ben affleck , loveable minnie driver , whose onscreen chemistry damon sizzling . matt emerald heap cheap diamonds , obviously multi-talented guy - he co-wrote screenplay well starred it . well worth seeing .	1

bottle rocket not movie you're going like . trust me , you'll probably hate it . it comedy not over top funny , it very very subtle . it basically just wes anderson movie . owen wilson wannabe criminal who plans get local mob boss , his former employer , notice him his friends pulling off heist bookstore . they go lam hide out motel before circumstances send them back home . funniest lines aren't likely ones you'll notice first time through . talking tipping help motel , why they wear white tape their noses when pulling off bookstore job , bob mapplethorpe description why he should gang , dignan explaining why they didn't rob his mom home ... it subtle incredibly funny . this comic treat movie , but it one most people aren't going like first time through , unless you've already familiarized yourself other wes anderson flicks like rushmore royal tenenbaums . it certainly not my favorite movie , but it really good stuff .

we went family theater see " charlie chocolate factory " . involvement tim burton johnny depp , need see treatment roald dahl classic children book got me interested . we ' 70s musical version gene wilder vhs . it ok but didn't quite capture dahl magic . this version less traditional musical all numbers featured oompa-loompas takeoffs big production numbers other movie musicals . i guess much could expected danny elfman , who music simpsons other burton movies ( including amazing " nightmare before christmas " ) . elfman also all oompa-loompa singing vocals . burton brings back story oompa-loompas willie wonka , while depp bring his own bizarre interpretation wonka role . it good followup his turn pirate jack sparrow " pirates caribbean . " other four kids who find golden tickets right mark -- gluttonous gloop , greedy veruca , vain veronica , smart-ass mike -- all get their just desserts , so speak . special mention also go deep roy ( indian actor , i assume -- how deep depp same movie ) who magic digital technology , plays all oompa-loompas , including one who wonka psychologist , young actor who plays good-hearted charlie title . squirrels also play important digitally-enhanced role . overall , this movie might little strange ( especially squirrels ) very small children , but good family fare its own style .	1

tyrone power not swashbuckler par errol flynn but this still decent movie genre . maureen o'hara helps out lot respect . power plays pirate captain caribbean who prays upon spanish shipping . he one infamous henry morgan lieutenants . show opens , morgan sent england stand trial piracy power captured spanish . he contemplating giving up pirate lifestyle but point becomes moot when he captured spanish . he showing defiance spanish governor suffering rack when rest pirates show up rescue him . victorious pirates their vengeance upon hapless cowardly spaniards when captain morgan shows up stops them . much everyone surprise , he pardoned king appointed new governor jamaica under theory he would most effective rooting out pirates . england now peace spain two want suppress freelance " free trade " . captain morgan hard position . he not trusted upper crust island neither he trusted all his old subordinates who determined continue their piratical ways . tyrone power one those trusted capt . morgan determined help him but his mind preoccupied . he love daughter former governor ( o'hara ) but she holds him contempt . finally , order secure all his aims , he goes " undercover " poses relapsed pirate . swashbuckler tradition , everything turns up roses after few swordfights broadsides . this not great movie but it enjoyable . still , i like flynn better .	1

... you . this film compared " logan run " , " matrix " , " coma " , name few , but it most strongly resembles 1979 movie " parts : clonus horror " , probably most widely screened viewers movie mock-a-thon " mystery science theater 3000 " . sitting through " island " , i kept thinking myself " boy , this looks familiar . " fact , " island " almost complete , play-by-play clone ( ba da ching ! ) " parts " , right down outfits worn clones . there currently lawsuit against bay brought makers " parts " , which should open-and-shut case . this film set futuristic clone colonie , where wealthy influential pay top dollar keep copies themselves available spare parts . clones kept docile dark facility employees , not allowed leave until they selected go almost mythical paradise ( island ) . course , clones allegedly going island actually euthanized their organs , their patrons gotten sick . movie focuses male clone who questions his environment eventually brings down enterprise . ewan mcgregor satisfactory this role , his acting reasonably good despite bland dialouge . his female counterpart , scarlet johansen , pure eye candy , mediocre actress who happens knockout blonde but leaves you wondering if she would get lead ( or even major part ) college play ( best performance turned sean bean , evil scientist� . ) there plenty action viewer chew , making entertaining enough popcorn movie , but it not only nothing special , it nothing original . maybe worth rental , but not much more	-1
kind me , go mark down horribly pretentious review unite : 02 . texh something demands interpretation , taken face value , it nothing . it noted all characters types , way , representing aspect human psyche . if you want interpret negative( ?, might actually positive or ambivalent ) conclusion end , it result fact every particular character incomplete . ichise f*cking stupid . he animal drive , which why powerless ran takes him . some episode , ichise remarks avoid ran prognostication(you destroy everything , you all alone end ) , he must take sophistication . civilization , rise above animal nature core his person . he remarks ran 25 , or 26 , he rushes back lux , since he met ran , he changed . before , whenever he met difficulty , he would critics texh claimed : " punch punch ! " episode 26 makes its response : ichise hasn't changed least . when onishi ordered ran kill her , ravaging mobs lux obliterates onishi , leaving only lumps texhnolyze his legs , ichise breaks into his signature rage . it references first episode : we cut flashback ichise living pit fighter . he punches mob , crushing their skulls , cheers crowd long since dead . blood pours floor rainlike torrent , staccato bullet fire . someone shoots his arm , severing control nerves . this extent his change : least he , accept his new body . he accepts his new arm , accepts his new leg . doc ghost high , returns her lab reactivates his texhnolyze . ichise , once more capable , slaughters mob . ichise , now without direction , searches nothing but ran . he heads opera house , seek kano find direction he not , himself . he meets kohakura his way up , sees rooted bodies shapes , unable kill , reduced staring their reality until end time . he meets kano . kano goes off long rant , how he never wanted go surface world first place : apparently , class manuevered their descent into lux , vast population guinea pigs . one doesn't know if gabe indigenous , or brought down class . this all method , it possible speculate kano raped ran . world texhnolyze , semen man apparently virulent poison times . yoshii killed hooker second volume coming her . his life energy overwhelmed woman , who only wishes live , who deprived any hope . here , kano might driven ran insane raping her . here , abortion murder : ran may ordered onishi abort pregnancy killing her . ichise , seeing ran corpsehead , attached obviously useless shape lifesupport unit , freaks out . he rages kano , ignorant . he punches kano head off . end , he resigned his fate . he badly wounded , probably die . he all alone end , after all . he can't allowed talk shapes rooted ground , steal their battery packs ensure their mobility . onishi arch conservative , other reviewer said his organization . he really can't effect any change , he cannot create future himself , organ , or lux(lukuss very funny , i'm told japanese version transliterates directly ruku9su or something . lukuss very similar lux , which : " international system unit illumination , equal one lumen per square meter .

director curtis hanson filmed many remarkable films : " la confidential " ( 1997 ) his most awarded film , " 8 mile " ( 2002 ) very good movie " her shoes " ( 2005 ) very successful incursion " family conflict " genre movie . " hand rock cradle " ( 1992 ) dramatic thriller full adrenalin . may some viewers plot quite predictable ... well it wasn't me ! i just seat edge my couch more than half movie . story follows : recently pregnant woman pays visit obstetrician discovers there new doctor there . dr. mott starts check-up ends sexual molestation claire . when she returns home she shares her anguish michael , her husband . they decide denounce dr. mott . here series dreadful events triggered : dr. mott commits suicide unable stand other patients denounces , his pregnant widow learns she broken spontaneous abort . some months later bartels enjoying their newborn michael convinces claire hire live-in nanny allowing her free time her occupations . after discarding some applicants , claire , " casually " meets " perfect nanny " : peyton flanders , who actually dr. mott widow seeking revenge . little little peyton disrupt bartels ' domestic life creating havoc amongst them , expelling gardener , arousing jealousies , emotionally separating claire her young daughter trying seduce michael . all this performed reckless duplicity . tension violence increases arriving hair-raising final scene . rebecca de mornay hideous nanny gives outstanding performance . i particularly surprised economy gestures she gives yet transmits viewer all volcanic passion her sentiments . ernie hudson mentally impaired gardener gives over par performance . last but not least robert elwit photography , especially home interiors , very good . thumbs up this movie ! reviewed max yofre .	1

i love watch action movies . better still , i love watch robert de niro action movies ( 15 minutes , men honour , godfather ... ) . i also love watch jean reno action movies ( professional , mission impossible , wasabi ... ) imagine my surprise , when i saw both robert de niro jean reno same action movie ! ronin very interesting movie . very exciting , too . it complex theme , twisting plot well perplexing subplots , exotic settings , rising falling actions , critical but unknown object pursuit , witty dialogue , all compounded host mysterious key characters their vague relationships ( ira terrorist , russian mobsters , ex-cia ex-kgb operatives ) . what i enjoyed most this movie watching sam ( robert de niro ) assuming role strategist snatch team . strategist , he always asking clarifying questions verifying details . i am amazed his astute power observation , shown below ... just name few scenes : - scanning surroundings various angles before entering pub checking out possible escape routes ; - sensing danger spotting sniper bridge while conducting covert weapon buying exchange near bridge ; - sizing up each member snatch team , especially gregor ( stellan skarsgard playing rogue electronics expert ) intentionally pushing cup over table edge ; - reconnaissance , testing camera taking photographs unsuspectingly hotel lobby creating diversion ... ; - noticing wrong suitcase immediately after ambush/shoot out ; - spotting wall advertisement possible lead whereabout russian mafia ; even vincent ( jean reno ) demonstrates it , especially when he spots , window cafe , young girl carrying metal suitcase , while trying figure out sam exact whereabout gregor , who switched stole original suitcase earlier . power observation obviously very important character trait ronin . i understand ronin masterless samurai . lone-wolf . maverick . mercenary . apparently , movie , each member snatch team ronin . movie , there even short history lesson exploits famous 47 ronins their eventual suicide ritual known sepaku , told jean pierre ( michael lonsdale ) . [ based actual historical events , only 46 them committed sepaku . last one pardoned shogun . ] most exhilarating parts movie obviously high-octane car chases rampant shoot-outs both nice paris settings ... quiet country road , highway then through busy side streets tunnel . there even amazing scene , showing sam doing his own surgery remove bullet his stomach mirror knife . most touching scenes movie dynamic comradeship seemingly mutual respect sam vincent , despite fact each them his own agenda snatch team . final scene , - fact throughout movie ' running time - , critical but unknown object pursuit remains mystery . conclude this review , i really enjoyed watching ronin very much . once again , i also learned human ingenuity creativity very important life ( or survival ) skills , characterised movie . this addition my resource repertoire .	1

before i bought this dvd used local store i hadn't even heard either series , much less seen them . i guess i fresh approach towards it since i didn't buy it simply because i liked series . ^_^ --- ninku movie ( more depth since no one really talked it yet ): fight scenes very well , even though no real weapons used ( i'm into sharp , pointy items shine :p ) . there lot detail used making special moves their effects . i didn't feel cheated all , even without any samurai swords . well known ninku , no one ever recognizes them ! fame fortune don't always go together they often searching ways get food money . circus performers pretend famous ninku team very town ninku arrive ! what worse , only job around imposters ' servents ! fusuke may look lot like child blank expression , but he captain first ninku division . movie , he shows himself very thoughtful , generous , loyal , level-headed guy ; what you'd expect leader . i found myself laughing him more than once during movie wondered how he could possibly former captain . i didn't any doubts once fight scene truely started . he becomes very serious vibe you get him changes . touji captain sixth division ninku . movie he seems rihoko brother . i shocked first see him tear off his clothes fight his underwear , but it became comical . aicho captain nineth division ninku . rihoko huge crush him he all he stay away her . rihoko doesn't fight , she just tags guys ( i'm pretty sure she fact touji sister ) . i think her main role comical relief occasional damsel distress , but i like her sometimes bossy character . penguin named hiroyuki . he very intelligent . unfortunely , he also tends really bad gas . poor fusuke seemingly faints when hiroyuki farts him movie . immature humor ? sure , but it still funny me . it isn't overdone or used bad taste , so i don't problem it . i'm sure it effective move fight . : poverall , it very funny , even if stupid kind way . --- yu yu hakusho : i could tell right away this movie best viewed after seeing series . i guess i lucked out store accidently gave me yu yu hakusho movie ( poltergeist report ) first accident . i got clue who who how they all felt each other . because i so new series i didn't really notice anything wrong characters or their voices , but i also confused certain things weren't explained because they assume you've watched series before movie . if you flexible let characters different than normal , then buy this used somewhere . it , far , not worth purchasing it brand new , so make sure you get it used	1

i vote no more after this one . first all , movie edited horribly . there numerous occurences where edits should tightened . acting so over top it ridiculous . mary griffith ( aimee graham ) father stereotypical demon father . we listen these kids talk camera throughout film how they live rave , so they one music how raveing druging their life ... i could only ask ... who cares ? then , kids all arrive rave . weehoo !! 45 minutes bah ! bah ! bah ! bah ! bah ! music seizure inducing strobe effects . kids so drugged up they spend most time sitting toilet . punks living beat up other kids . punks who riot create havoc no reason . drive shooting looked so fake overdramatized . gets you all teary-eyed . not because you any emotional connection any characters , but because you spent $1.50 renting movie discount day spent 80 minutes your life watching it ... well ... 72 minutes if you fast forward through credits ... 3:30 bah ! bah ! bah ! opening credits ... geez	-1
most films try capture significance sporting event by-gone era suffer because they fail attach it any historical context . upon first view , i thought " 61 * " somewhat guilty . it unfair opinion because time i just finished watching " seabiscuit " " miracle " , both which slightly superior films . now , however , i've change mind after second viewing . billy crystal enormous job capturing mm boys 1961 . crystal all bases covered ( bad pun intended ) . he covers maris ' can-do spirit he approaches babe single-season home run mark . however , crystal also covers hostility this drew press fans . barry pepper great job conveying maris ' quiet suffering anger spawned . meanwhile , maris ' friend , beloved mickey mantle also nearing ruth record , but doesn't generate such animosity . off field , however , crystal shows us mantle making changeover fun-loving young man almost self-destructing adult . around these two men , press -- specifically voracious new york press -- circles like vultures . side characters fairly well-rounded well-portrayed : specifically , anthony michael hall whitey ford . crystal fondness era evident every scene . fortunately , he doesn't wax too nostalgic . instead , he gives us honest view time when baseball barely clinging its innocence , man who not deserve hostility asterisk haunted him .	1
this unsparing , unsentimental look pro football which players alternately brutes , slaves management . coaches shamelessly manipulate players then discard them moment injury strikes ; players drugged up order coax them onto field , while same time unpopular players ensnared drug charges order trap them contract renegotiation time . " north dallas forty " probably one my favorite sports movies , definitely my favorite football movie . that because its defiant outsider approach -- " ball four " , baseball book made peter gent football novel possible , only ever wound up lame sitcom ; " north dallas forty " goes all way . even though movie based dallas cowboys 1960s , instantly dated 1970s ' filmmaking technique remains timeless ( even if it same director who made " weekend bernie " , which timeless very different reasons ) . part movie continuing appeal remains its cast . nick nolte brilliant lead , rebellious but hones t-t o-a-fault north dallas wide receiver phil elliott . phil tells it like it sees management what they , but doesn't realize he cheated out his career until third or fourth time he double-crossed owners , coaches friends alike . playing riff dandy don meredith , country singer/songwriter mac davis plays sly quarterback seth maxwell . rest football team filled out several ex-nfl players . john matuszak second acting career launched this movie , bo svenson football career should launched this movie . coaches , charles durning ( cliche-spouting offensive coordinator ) great g.d. spradlin ( playing thinly veiled tom landry ) both dominate their scenes . yes , that dabney coleman oil man part owner who delivers one movie best lines ( " you speak canadian ? " ) . dayle haddon looks great phil love interest , but otherwise gets overshadowed rest cast . she seems so disinterested phil throughout movie i convinced their relationship wouldn't make it week after story ended . kotcheff directs his football scenes interesting approach could never duplicated today : there not single wide shot packed house , not single closeup spectator north dallas face paint maxwell jersey . gone excesses modern tv football coverage , only product endorsement i could spot xylocaine . most early football action shown mute flashbacks , climactic game against chicago not joined until after two-minute warning . even such minimal football , however , kotcheff action so muddy , bloody cruel you imagine final game sequence cued up . . ' vcr fateful monday night he tangled joe theismann leg . always worth watching every late january , " north dallas forty " one those films you hope never going remade , because original everything you need football movie	1
don't make mistake i buying this copy this classic italian movie . it complete disaster faded colors grainy images . i can't beleive they put this one market . you'll get see three sketches all right , but transfer simply amateurish insulting . no subtitles , not even original italian track , no gallery photos etc . this worst dvd i ever bought . luckily others , new version released 2005 which proper treatment . i just hope visconti last movie innocent won't fall this category when they released it someday . let us pray preservation laura antonelli beauty	-1
remake classic steinbeck short novel 1939 screen gem , which starred burgess meredith lon chaney , jr. here john malkovich plays lenny , he excellent dim-witted giant who only " wants take care rabbits . " gary sinise george , lenny friend " caretaker , " i like him better than meredith same role back ' 39 . movie faithful adaptation , few minor changes : black man crooks , example , doesn't get involved george lenny scheme getting ranch " living off fat land " book . also whereas shooting lenny after he accidentally killed curley wife long drawn out ' 39 movie , here it relatively quick - though short flashback tag added no particular reason . it good production all around , certainly worth watch	1

tupac fan or not , this film affect you end . it takes you deep mental trip through this man life beginning end . yet , unlike most music documentaries , tupac narrates this film himself . using hundreds old interviews , both film also audio recordings . he tells his own story , his own way . film starts off showing journey tupac car through las vegas streets night he shot death . while you watch this song playing , one last songs he would ever . it so ironic because it talking what actually happend him night .

" tupac mother afenia , produced this film put all her heart soul into making it happen . god bless her strength so . tupac tells his story growing up poor without father lean . growing up community more drugs streets than food table . you get understand man behind music alot more . tupac like most us , angel devil rolled into one . public eye , tupac seen many thug evil man but he also same man recorded songs like " dear mama , keep your head up brenda got baby . " these songs showed his emotional side real deep concern future youth . however , tupac also got caught up angry , gangster life style rap music once he became famous . he even admitts film . " i immature my ego out control . i said alot stupid things i wish i could take back . " one most chilling scenes film first time tupac got shot five times new york recording studio 1995 . this what started east coast/west coast war rap music . film inter-cuts perfectly two stories shooting . tupac version what happend biggie smalls/puff daddy version . no , they don't match up . tupac went grave thinking they set him up night . once you see this , it up you decide yourself . all all , this fantastic documentay very talented music artist brings it you very human level .	1
aside " breakfast tiffany " " my fair lady , " audrey hepburn didn't get any better than this . hepburn plays ariane chavasse , parisian student cello who becomes enamoured rich , older american , frank flanagan , played gary cooper . flanagan seems like unlikely character return her love , however , he long history womanizing playboy . he even confesses ariane his belief couples " should always behave though they planes " his motto : " he loves runs away , lives love day . " you very easily predict how two going end up , but it happens , film ends , unpredictable , dramatic extremely moving fashion should leave most viewers misty-eyed . maurice chevalier excellent arianne father . some criticized gary cooper " too old , " i think film would absolutely perfect if he few years younger . ( why title my review says " almost perfect . " ) but cooper still excellent choice role . he looked good his age stage presence , time , unrivalled . ( since when tall , handsome , suave , rich men problems attracting younger women ? )	1
stuart gordon dagon surprisingly excellent bit lovecraftian horror , although it feels times like offspring one corman poe adaptations via very wet wicker man ezra godden finds himself rain-soaked fishing village spain where locals long since abandoned christian god ancient pagan one dagon return gold fish . unfortunately , side-effect three generations devotion they're all mutating into sea creatures tendency wear faces those stray humans who stumble across them get skinned alive or mated dagon their troubles ... it may sound cheesy , but while it not particularly frightening it played commendable straight face plenty atmosphere . it just shame writers got little too obsessive hero talking binary systems . lion gate dvd short extras , doesn't include original story listed packaging , but include couple audio commentaries star director , production sketches trailer .	1

this german film directed hermine huntgeburth like comic spin grifters but added sexual component . when one 3 petty criminals who wallet snatch using blind man ploy injured chase , replacement chosen someone who tried steal them failed . his punishment stripped two gay male members team , which prefigures sexual triangle eventuates when both father his daughter attracted new member . we know when we told group rule no exchange body fluids it said broken . huntgeburth gets comic mileage out who aggressor each relationship stolen moments intimacy they fear discovered third party . most refreshing touch how father ( gotz george ) established mean his gay partner , yet he becomes foolish when faced attentions younger man , if he cannot believe it possible , shakespearian appearance george emphasises him classically defined pathetic figure . george actually resembles brunette heavy-set ralph fiennes . daughter probably least interesting role , but felix eitner boy demonstrates bisexual trend modern sexuality , free sexual preference european men , question sex duplicitious behaviour . when eitner pet snake disposed cruelly , huntgeburth sets up expectation his own fate , snake metaphor . accordian music niki reiser sets tone it melancholy suggestion exotic mischief , thankfully huntgeburth treatment lacks concluding cruelty stephen frears title	1

look past surface this movie it really loneliness , range consequences around " falling love " someone you don't know . yeah , characters debauched , stupid things , but it all related their need " connect " someone . all them make mistakes , none them happy end . other reviewers mentioned , this isn't film everyone ; there several gross-out/desperate sex scenes , but they work context movie . i don't much more say hasn't already said ( said better ) other reviewers . i'll finish up adding if you went small , liberal arts college where everyone knew everyone , everyone business ( i ) , trust me , you " know " most people movie probably get weird combination nostalgia " thank god i'm past part my life !

performances flynn rathbone shine this fine remake 193o original - which conveniently used much same aerial footage . major brand ( basil rathbone ) , commanding officer squadron british royal flying corps stationed france , called butcher his top officer , captain courtney ( errol flynn ) - because his hardened attitude toward sending inexperienced young flyers their death . courtney his best friend , lieutenant scott ( david niven ) , their own way coping constant death new recruits ; they drink toast dead , sing song , then go back devising diverting , thrill-seeking pranks ... it implied howard hughes sued warner bros . claiming certain story ideas techniques which used this film curiously similar some those used his 193o production hell angels . hughes lost suit when it determined disputed ideas originated john monk saunders via his personal experiences air service : it basis first aa-winning film , 1927 silent wings . 1941 , warners blended aspects their 1936 film ceiling zero this one amp ; came up flight patrol (!) . among musical numbers which heard this vastly entertaining film include such vintage goodies pack up your troubles old kit bag amp ; poor butterfly	1
sorry , but giving this set bad rating just because aip-versions aren't included stupid my opinion . this box includes 5 fantastic movies bava ( yes , even " knives avenger " great one ) overall amazing quality very good bonus features . i believe there good reason ab didn't include different cuts " girl who knew too much " " 3 faces fear " : legal issues . if these solved , hopefully we see these versions someday dvd ( though only one really interests me " evil eye " . " black sabbath " would just nice because karloff own dubbing , but everything else clearly inferior italian version . ) until then - enjoy what this box , it amazing value cheap price . course many people who want buy this , already may different dvds some movies there - so everyone must decide themselves if it worth getting .	1

this film everything modern character studies long . ' five easy pieces ' revealing wayward culture ; it strikes audience its emotional interactions ; lets us peer into hearts minds very intriguing personalities . story follows robert dupea ( nicholson ) , who abandoned his well-to-do , intellectual family proletarian lifestyle manual labor promiscuity . his impetus clear beginning -- our culture restrictive absurd , must rejected . but refuting his old life doesn't exempt him world ludicrousness we find him restless discontented opening . arguments his girlfriend famous ' chicken salad sandwich ' scene epitomize this agitation . dupea returns his family under pretext attending his ill father . there , he finds what he believes could his salvation form sophisticated woman who also romantic optimistic ( she doesn't believe she ever bored ) . her , dupea sees reason justification his old life considers it once again . clash interest results , generating sharpest interactions bitterest conflicts . this clash all modern character studies aim . failing show value rejected old life , however , there no good reason clash character seen shallow heartless , leaving audience nothing study . enjoy this picture craftsmanship which rafelson molds internal conflict , art evidently admired these days very rarely achieved	1
while second movie gave us grand adventure first movie gave us ... well , movie , third gives us very mature story . we open dr. spencer hale his daughter , molly . molly only her father now . her mom vanished some time earlier research race pokemon called unown , which look like letters . hale taken up research she left behind , not just research but presumably find what happened her bring her back . every night , he reads his daughter before bed . her favorite book book legendary pokemon , including unown dog-type ( not lion-type ) called entei . molly drawn entei because his strength intelligence , compares her dad him . after bonding scene rings very real , e-mail comes skyler , hale assistant . he says he found old structure more clues unown , so hale leave meet him right away . molly disappointed she left alone , but goes sleep . temple , hale finds some stone pieces , sort like large runes , images unown them . he accidentally releases some , they open portal draw him inside . skyler doesn't see it , discovers too late hale gone . this leaves molly without father , just house caretaker skyler . molly doesn't understand what happened , one night goes her father things returned . included his gear chest held unown tiles . she spills chest open begins playing letters , spelling out mama , papa , molly . " they're together . me , " she says . but she also accidentally activates tiles , unown swarm into mansion . molly isn't afraid . " you want play me ? " unown read thoughts living things alter reality . this presumably what happened hale his wife : they wanted understand unown , so they took them their dimension . molly feels alone like world beyond her control , so unown turn mansion into crystal palace her dreams . they also create mighty entei , which molly immediately latches onto papa different appearance . entei simply says , " if what you wish . " now we get opening credits . i can't remember last time movie took long introduce its concepts instead cast . here comes ash ketchum , pikachu , misty williams , brock harrison . they traveling greenfield , one most beautiful places world . way , they meet lisa , pokemon trainer . she ash friendly battle , which introduces us ash line-up . unlike first movie , where opening battle rival trainer seemed cruel inspired ego , this plays more like it supposed -- friendly if competitive test coaching training skill . combatants all their pokemon all share lunch afterwards , fact , ash lisa complimenting each other reacting self-assurance modesty . she her way greenfield herself , offers guide them . when they get over hill , though , they find most grounds turned crystal hale mansion middle . tv news crew also shows up report phenomena . broadcast watched delia ketchum , ash mom . there some implication she long-time affection spencer hale she might his road not taken . news also seen professor samuel oak , ash neighbor hale teacher . he delia concerned hales , take off figure out what happened . while ash , his friends , oak , delia get together talk events , news crew gets delia camera moment . molly watching news entei her side . she recognizes delia some pictures her hale around house . staring longingly delia , she tells entei , " i want mama , too . " entei leaves long enough hypnotize delia into thinking she molly mother taking her mansion . it falls ash his friends rescue his mom . you might wondering where team rocket , pokemon theives consisting humans jesse james their pokemon comic foil meowth . they get very little screen time , showing up long enough establish their presence , get shot down their balloon , wander through mansion provide some comic relief , save ash falling one scene . they even acknowledge how skimpy their parts , meowth asking one point , " you think we'll get bigger parts next movie ? " how much you enjoy movie hinges primarily how much you believe ' two goal , three act ' story structure villian capturing loved one unite protagonist two goals vital film . like other movies , there isn't really bad guy sense doing something rotten due some feeling personal anarchy . even mewtwo first film didn't seem evil so much misguided needing taught . lot critics i've read complain unown aren't very intimidating villians , but they aren't supposed . they catalysts , plot devices if you . entei literally serves molly wishes , fueling his actions . strictly speaking , movie four seperate goals , stopping entei , saving molly , saving delia , stopping unown , each requiring seperate action . film continually advances no clear act division well . if ' two goal three act ' structure vital you , you definitely not enjoy this film . characterization here full force , characters behave very realistically . best example this brock . brock hound dog . let almost any woman appear , save misty or jesse team rocket ( might missed someone ) , he hit them . jesse villain ( sort ) , misty both too young him they've through enough together she more sister than possible love interest . when molly dreams she pokemon trainer so she battle ash company , she morphs into full grown woman . brock doesn't hit her , though , he remains focused situation , remarkable change . likewise , his banter during duel molly remains true . he fewer instances captain obvious , likewise oak fewer instances captain explination . lisa seems exist just show ash pokemon line-up give him cell phone " pokegear " before he sets off rescue , but even she exudes certain behaviors , like confident strut not swagger . but deepest characterization goes little molly . even when confronted fact world she inhabits not real , she still clings fearfully papa . crystal spikes form walls around her when ash intrudes tries take delia away . ash charizard get upper hand ( during entei vs . charizard sequence ) , spikes start shooting out castle walls aiming them . everything molly dreamworld , including cold inner sactum , reflects her scared mentality . during pokemon fights brock misty , where her tiny creatures score victories against giants like onix only few blows , she laughs delight things go so well her . her laughter frightening since she not feeding her ego , but gorging it . this film dark probably deepest storytelling series likely see . it also coupled , once again , one those annoying shorts start , this one introducing pichu , lower form pikachu . like pikachu , they almost human-level intelligence rambunctious streak . one pichu , seeing pikachu , pats his ass couple times . then later pulls down corner his eye pikachu , which rude gesture japan ( " dear jack valenti , thank you rating . lots love , warner bros . " ) . it bits contradict pokemon continuity don't make any contextual sense , but art nice there some humor . poster says short features " dozens new pokemon their first ever animated appearance . " don't too impressed , i counted only 14 , i think some them appear tv show first . once again , use time get your snacks go bathroom , real movie starts afterward . afterthought : complaint critics how molly reunited her dad , then her mom , long shots during end credits . this portion movie sort travelogue ash journey , giving wonderful sense scope his adventures . one critic particular says this robs scenes their emotional impact . i think it actually helps . movie american pie , characters learn sex isn't everything . yet not one them still virgin end flick . yeah , they learned their lesson , their reward completely negates it . pokemon 3 , defining moment molly life when she opts leave crystal mansion , bravely facing uncertain world without help unown . her reunion her parents important , but it further development her life , not event solidified her personality enabled her take world . coming travelogue , alongside ash he continues see expand his world , makes alegorical sense . but that just me . ----- this review original location site called ' keeping it reel -- movie reviews peter ' . thought it would nice put it here	1

red lantern carefully crafted story centered around young woman named songlian , played ever-brilliant gong li . songlian hopes dreams college better life cruelly cut short sudden unexpected death her father . no money school insistence her mother , songlian forced marry chen , wealthy landowner who already three wives his own . each wives reside separate wings his centuries-old castle estate . living quarters extremely upscale come complete personal servant maid . but , like storied bird gilded cage , their lives sad , empty lonely . although wives command respect obedience hired help , they nothing more than chattel wealthy chen . each day , wives , their respective servant , stand entrance their quarters waiting see which door " red lantern " placed . this how chen chooses his wife evening . " lucky " chosen wife treated ritual foot massage one older woman servants her apartment filled large glowing red lanterns which burn brightly through night . there so many lanterns set up both inside out it , first appearances , seems romantic but quickly ends up underscoring true nature rite . it custom quickly becomes apparant nothing more than lewd , sadistic sexual subjugation . it not romantic , it not passionate ... it just cruel game chen entertainment . story progresses , we see struggle almost every scene . there secret alliances wives , servants elite frequent master estate . there continual animosity wives they plot scheme stay viable remain master good favor . there oversupply backstabbing , betrayal class struggle found all major players . we also see formation disintegration relationships wives . , although master tries present himself peacemaker , it gradually realized he actually instigator most hostility . wives scratch claw ( metaphorically , ) his attention only serves satisfy his own massive ego . cycles abuse perhaps no more apparant when we see wives , who clearly victims their own right , begin victimize each other attempt elevate their standing within social order castle . film rich many moments both sad poignant . example , although songlian not originally welcome ritualistic foot massage , she grew like it missed it tremendously those nights when she not selected " wife evening " . she , other unchosen wives , endure very loud rattling sound foot massage across courtyard . it only further reminded them they unwanted they not special . she miss actual foot massage or what massage represented ? it became nothing more than cruel pavlovian experiment part chen . chen seems enjoy manipulating women . alternating reward punishment , he carefully trains them if they pets . castle cauldron sorts it only matter time before everything bubbles over . without giving too much away , i'll only say storyline moves resulting tragic consequences could hardly seen entirely unexpected . heart this film its exploration indomitable female psyche . film continually centers around very strong female characters struggling survive under horrific conditions both psychologically emotionally . ability female psyche maintain personal identity spiritual freedom within male-dominated zeitgeist feudal china intrinsic this story although this sort struggle not really unique asian culture , it handled very deliberate unapologetic fashion makes this film not only special watch but , necessary well . i've working backwards through director , yimou zhang body work , process i unwittingly saved best last . just kidding ... well , maybe little . yimou zhang certainly director who likes experiment . it seems like he not content make same film over over no matter how good recipe . each his films unique distinct quality . this film lensed very traditional straightforward fashion equal amounts closeups far shots . storyline engrossing carried rich narrative style . dialogue , although integral story seems almost secondary unspoken communication form facial expressions , body language other physical interactions characters . film many long visual sequences which seemed tell story better than any carefully worded text ever could . my opinion , this gong li finest performance date i highly recommend seeing this film	1

i grew up pink panther , it blast able see them all again . i've only finished first disk , but these cartoons excellent . times trickster times tricked , pink panther such outstanding character he pulls you no matter what part he plays . special features fifth disk fun too , especially title credits peter sellers ' " pink panther " movies . that where i started -- watching opening credits " pink panther " then going back first short early 60s . other reviews right when they say some weaker cartoons ones where pink panther talks . it seems so superfluous , like they threw voice him because they needed . but i see where animators just getting sense character those early shorts , it probably worth experimentation just see if it worked . fortunately , saner heads prevailed , pink panther quickly lost his voice . occasional laugh track equally jarring , again appearing one short not next . overall , this set certainly worth it pink panther fans young old . humor light , animation fun stylized , soundtrack rocks . this cartooning its best	1

i invariably credit robert . howard genius behind conan however , this film john milius brilliant it own right . look , if i summed this movie up one word , word would ' epic ' . you feel like you like you've just landed yourself somewhere euro-asian steppe before tides history washed upon mankind . version i bought complete quest which carries both conan movies . conan destroyer ( sequel ) more goofy 80 pizzaz i recall growing up but don't knock it until you try it ! also note soundtrack basil pouldoris . conan soundtracks arguably most superlative movie soundtracks all time . basil pouldoris ties his magic give this conan what i call infinite watchability ... these movies never get old no matter how many times you see them . all characters some extremely memorable lines you grow love . schwarzenegger himself epitomy laconic philosopher stoic warrior approach life but even he breaks out some killer lines . hell , i just wish arnold would third conan instead playing politician	1

i wanted like this film . reviews i read it weren't very optimistic but i don't believe everything i read . unfortunately , this time reviewers correc t.t he dying gaul sensationalistic look people , quite frankly , disgusted me . i am not talking sexual preferences here . these people disgusting so many reasons , none which sexual preferences . i stomach characters unsavory if there common sense perspective given their actions . this film , however , characters revealed decent people who make mistakes . nope . they all creeps . plot film writer screenplay gets emails what he believes his dead lover . what up ? this educated person . he able create complete screenplay so his use language must above average . yet , believe dead person would communicate living - through emails , no less - not something even your average person would fall . yes , there relationship facts given emails but he confided facts person one sending emails . plot film gets even more laughable - yes , i found myself laughing this movie - when old medea plot line came into play . , i'm referring greek medea , not african-american one . although , her films least entertaining ! acting this movie not good others said . sarsgaard most annoying . some scenes he pronounced lilt his speaking voice attempt sound " gay . " other scenes he speaks normally . i found this very distracting . campbell scott , he gives same performance i've seen him give other films . he isn't bad actor but he no paul newman . them all , clarkson bes t.t he dying gaul pretentious project insulting gays buddhists . yes , buddhism plays role film , too . if you want see gay film go brokeback mountain . if you want see movie , time , prove one those wonderful films provokes gales laughter because it so unintentionally funny , watch dying gaul . just prepared learn more specifics gay sex than you probably want know	-1
out all endless undying jason films , this one few series actually provides some scares regardless relentless predictibility . ( jason never dies . dumb blondes run out back door instead front door like they should . car ignition won't work all right times . women make obnoxious screams when they're hiding just merely say ' jason i'm here!' yatta-yatta-yatta ! ) one interesting scene ( obviously i'm male my prime when i say this ) when two lovers humping ' 80s rock music back camper . camper jumping up down . i think majority heterosexual men , when watching scene , left thinking " how come my girl doesn't me ? " these cheesy slasher horror films 80 genre don't much merit categories acting skills , realistic gore or physical animation . but , some kinky sex scenes without overtly pervasive pornographic content playboy some horrific surprises , it proves nice viewing couple dating steadily . so , grab your popcorn your hormones . remember , same hormones chemicals our bodies regulate sexuality also regulate aggression , fear , anxiety , happiness . ( testosterone , oxytocine , adrenaline , etc . ) so , when you combine all these elements into hour half screen interactions this caliber , then it proves quite opportunity some foreplay imagination .	1
my son ( 3 yrs old one month ) watches this car loves this video . he pretty crazy trucks , tractors , like , but some videos just too advanced technical . this one great . tractor segment ( mostly farm tractors ) farm vehicle segment , they show lot different aspects farming , including steps seedling harvesting , eating what you grow , visiting dairy farm ( what made dairy products ) , even using airplane spray insecticides fertilizers . but this all todler- young child level , main guy , dave likeable , very importantly , his voice not annoying all . dump truck segment great , too- they show all different kinds , all different activities- even filling up gas , which toddlers so fascinated . there no catchy tunes , but plus , since they so often what makes video unbearable adults . this video really well , all live action video , narrator acting important participant . it completely holds attention my son , i actually enjoy it .	1

" seinfeld " pretty good job rebounding larry david departure show . jerry doesn't many segments featured around him this season , possibly because stepped up demands his time behind camera . however , ones which he featured very funny . example , jerry check bounce , unfriendly merchant puts returned check display his store . word gets back jerry parents , they jump conclusions decide jerry must broke . jerry dad decides return work help support jerry . unfortunately , job his dad takes working elaine , situation doesn't work out anyone . george , reeling mixed emotions he losing susan end season seven , prepares go without her , but finds he really can't . instead , susan parents start charitable foundation her memory george installed board large framed photograph susan framed wall room where foundation meetings held . later season , george meet woman he interested , she seems interested him . george , always trying better his position through lying but usually just worsening his lot because it , same thing this instance . woman believes george tourist arkansas , george decides continue deception faking move city so he continue relationship . way george sees it , if you condense everything he accomplished last ten years into just few weeks , it seems quite impressive . elaine enters alternate universe when she meets kevin his friends , who turn out opposite jerry his friends every way . she likes fact kevin his friends inspire her better person - they genuinely kind helpful they enjoy reading . however , ultimately elaine just not cut out among them because her own selfish personality traits . perhaps funniest episode featuring elaine " english patient " , titled after best picture winner 1996 . her boss , eccentric peterman , loves film forces her go see it him . elaine hates movie , just can't take sitting through it its entirety without blurting out how she feels . peterman gives her chance penance her bad attitude which involves most hilarious assignment . " susie " , due series mix-ups , elaine winds up alternate identity work - " susie " . her coworkers begin discussing her though elaine susie two different people . her ultimate solution problem susie " die " , complete memorial service fictitious woman winds up packed mourners . course , kramer adventures unbelievable ever . this season his apartment turns into " red planet " due neon sign kenny rogers roasters restaurant shining through his window all night . first he doing everything he put restaurant out business , but when he jerry temporarily switch apartments pressure off , kramer finds himself addicted restaurant food . episode , elaine boss jay peterman trying write his memoirs , but finds his own life isn't very interesting . his solution buy kramer life story use it his own . kramer peterman eventually get into argument over details arrangement , kramer answers back starting his own " peterman reality tours " . finally , kramer incensed fact he no longer find public place which he light up cigar , opens smoking lounge his own apartment . result all exposure tobacco smoke , kramer ages prematurely goes his attorney friend , fas t-t alking flamboyant jackie chiles , file suit against tobacco companies . when kramer negotiates deal tobacco companies without jackie approval , jackie declares results " most public his many humiliations " . summary , this season very good more emphasis fast-paced zaniness rather than comedy made more commentary human nature you saw during larry david years . however , i still highly recommend it	1

when i think cary grant , i think suave , immaculate , debonair actor who defined cool his own era well our own . monkey business , delightfully funny screwball comedy 1952 , shows us very different side cary grant . blessed major talent likes grant , ginger rogers , marilyn monroe , lovably huffy character actor charles coburn , monkey business delivers good old-fashioned comedy start finish . grant plays barnaby fulton , chemist working develop age-retarding formula . ginger rogers edwina , his more than understanding wife ; she handles his absent-minded episodes grace style , putting his interests before her own every time . fulton boss mr. oxley ( coburn ) very anxious solution found , he already past retirement age , but some piece puzzle just not fall into place - not , , until one fulton lab monkeys escapes her cage , mixes her own formula , then stashes it water cooler . when fulton tries out his latest concoction , washed down cup water , he soon reverts back teenager mentality , running around like wild man even entertaining lois laurel ( monroe ) , mr. oxley secretary , afternoon . eventually , effects wear off he returns his normal self , but both he his wife conduct several more experiments ( both accidentally well purposely ) movie progresses , each them regressing farther farther back toward childhood each time . naturally , all these goings-on , big , zany ending store everyone involved . best part this movie childlike antics cary grant ginger rogers they carry some time like couple eight-year-olds . marilyn monroe stunning her character never fails produce laughs . lois , who begun coming work early each morning because her boss isn't satisfied her punctuation , not hired her secretarial skills , but , mr. oxley says , anyone type . marilyn gets fair share screen time this early film hers , but there no question cary grant ginger rogers thoroughly steal show their comedic antics . end , monkey business shows youth state mind , best expressed barnaby line , " you're old only when you forget you're young .	1

" dreamgirls , " originally hit broadway production 1980s , lavish musical inspired history motown its super group supremes . like songs " grace my heart " which clearly based career carole king , soundtrack music " dreamgirls , " good it , can't match power real motown sound . actually film musical numbers hardly sound like motown sound , but still some them real showstoppers thanks film gifted stars , especially dynamic singing voice oscar-winner jennifer hudson . " dreamgirls " you should not expect much story , which runs familiar course superstars or celebrities , meteoric rise three rb singers ( played beyonc� knowles , jennifer hudson anika noni rose ) fame their subsequent troubles ego-clashing within members their shrewd , business-minded producer/manager ( jamie foxx ) . it same old story you heard somewhere else gossip magazines . . once three girls ' dreams come true glitter showbiz , it takes center their lives , once it , none characters allowed breathe much . anika noni rose danny glover not given enough time their characters , even role beyonc� knowles not fleshed out satisfactorily . eddie murphy outstanding popular singer ladies ' man named james " thunder " early ( haircut like little richard ) , but there nothing new thunder story his love affair fading stardom . still i enjoyed watching " dreamgirls " . i know it lots shortcomings , i hear complaints fans original stage ( which i haven't seen ) . yes , i know . perhaps number film shortcomings depends each viewer taste or expectations , i liked filmed version " dreamgirls " what it . i like it its entertainment values such gorgeous costumes , beautifully staged live scenes cinematography , plus powerful , emotionally-charged songs jennifer hudson , all which compensate lack better story	1

mountbatten described historian man whose " immense vanity hunger publicity power , coupledwith his vaulting ambition propensity realigning thetruth narrowly outweighed his colossal energy charm " . all this portrayed brilliantly nicole williamson this superb production mountbatten terms last viceroy india well its first governor-general . however , this series not only focus mountbatten but shows political religious forces work brought both india independence , but also savage violence accompanied partition sub-continent legacy hate religious fanaticism now threaten not only successor states , india , pakistan bangladesh , but possibly entire world due their nuclear arsenals . series also features excellent performances janet suzman lady edwina mountbatten who one great " do-gooders " history , vladek sheybal enigmatic , iron-willed , tubercular mohammed ali jinnah , especially sam dastor gandhi whose portrayal him far superior ben kingsley film " gandhi " . one drawback series it based heavily memoirs mountbatten his assistant alan campbell-johnson who clearly biased against jinnah fans nehru gandhi , blaming partition india solely jinnah " stubborness " . other historians more nuanced view indian leaders pointing out jinnah accept idea united india under loose federal system it nehru gandhi congress party rejected it giving jinnah no alternative but seek total separation india muslims . similarly , jinnah portrayed responsible war kashmir , whereas according rules defined partition , majority religious group should able choose which successor state they associated , but kashmir majority muslims never given this opportunity becuase nehru , kashmiri himself , insistent taking kashmir india . none this detracts , however , sheer pleasure seeing this vast panorama portrayed television . anyone interested great historical events or personages enjoy this series	1

ruthless people brilliant 1980 comedy still entirely enjoyable two decades later ( just enjoy posh interior decorating schemes , full triangles random colors ! ) . don't read convoluted plot synopsis provided amazon . basics this : danny devito millionaire character ( he fashion designer called spandex mini skirt king ) wants murder his harping , overweight , annoying wife , played bette midler . fortunately him , day he plans take her out , judge reinhold his wife kidnap midler character get ransom get back devito stealing their fashion ideas . great ! now all devito refuse pay ransom go against all kidnappers ' demands , his little problem solved ! it not so simple , plot turns crazy point , some crosses double-crosses , extortion chief police , dumb boy-toy boyfriends , adulterous affairs , disturbed neighborhood serial killers , clown suits . cast this movie amazing . midler stands out most , woman who goes through metaphorphasis during her kidnapping . reinhold perfect balance genuinely nice guy who wants so hard ruthless criminal . devito pure slime , though through . also , bill pullman supreme foolish blond boy-toy , possibly " stupidest man world .

" happy birthday me " not great movie any stretch imagination . fact , one could even say it not good , but there any denying this movie product 1980 slasher movement horror movies ? either you like 80 slasher movies or you not ... either way this movie part parcel 1980 horror cinema . when i first saw this movie when i kid , i not find it scary then , nor i find it scary now some 25 years later . said , " happy birthday me " dark little tale full surprises . first , you " who dunnit " theme working quite well throughout movie , end movie you couple twists kind surprise you funny kind way . basically , " happy birthday me " girl who trouble remembering dark moment her past when her friends not come her birthday party ... he mother quite angry it . now , she still got her friends , but they dropping like flies this movie one one . there quite few gruesome ( although not necessarily realistic ) " death " scenes which keep gore hound fairly satisfied . suspense decent , but drags little bit flashbacks movie seems " tongue cheek " quality it rather than purely horror characterization . ending my opinion kind lame , but some people love it sure . movie keep you guessing least certain degree , but not enough keep you edge your seat . overall , " happy birthday me " not great suspense flick or horror movie any stretch imagination . sure , there plenty surprises , but surprises only go so far movie like this ... it takes more than some kills , " who dunnit " plot bunch twists make good horror movie . clearly , acting kind bland includes ms. little house prairie too . " happy birthday me " definitely missing something . there some character development , but weakness cast very evident certainly hinders this movie this regard overall well . however , " happy birthday me " just enough keep you watching decent enough kills keep horror movie honest . all all , this really very average horror movie which best appreciated someone who lived through 80 , appreciates horror genre during this time period . you probably won't get scared this one , but you might enjoy this flick its nostalgia , 80s cheese classic slasher pattern if nothing else . so , this group early 20 somethings find out who killer before they all killed off ? , why they killed ? who killer ? what lead character loss memory any this ? answers all these questions more revealed this 80s slasherfest , " happy birthday me "	-1

history teacher i am always looking good materials use classroom . i use exerpts book my global hist . class used use 1939 version film supplement reading . older version truer book but over top acting lou ayers doesn't click very well today young viewers . they more likely laugh drama older version . 1979 version misses some books irony because it bipasses , or treats very lightly , some crucial scenes book , but character portrayals somber mood film much more apt hold my students attention . i enjoyed this film when it first aired television almost 30 years ago happy finds it dvd so i use it classroom	1

shakespeare comedy , " much ado nothing , " only positive effect its audience when read . his use verbal sarcasm intellectual farce turns circumstances love into exactly what they many times truly : comedy . shakespeare creates situations appear serious characters within script , yet actually humorous audience . because they able observe things characters themselves not privy , audience able witness full absurdity many messes created within plot characters themselves . while evaluating this play , i found it interesting while shakespeare comedies , " midsummer night dream , " demonstrates how it love causes us foolish things , " much ado nothing " shows way people complicate love themselves . each comedy centers theme love , making it comedic entertaining , yet two hold contrasting views . characters ' actions " midsummer night dream " involuntarily controlled their affections , whether they real or perceived , yet actions those found " much ado nothing " what control outcome love created . throughout this story , shakespeare purposes illustrate many foolish things individuals which only complicate love further than it already . many continually deny how they feel , case benedick beatrice , while others , like claudio , quick fall into love just eager fall out again . love fickleness shown when claudio jumps quickly sharp accusations based upon false testimony , again when benedick beatrice fall love due supposed affection other . story also demonstrates how others manipulate affections , negative or positive results . leonato , don john , other miscellaneous characters add complexity show increase havoc comes increase people situation . this play communicated strongly me circumstances not always entirely complicated they appear . just false identities twisted facts create unneeded , yet hilarious , tension throughout story , putting more stress importance issues within my life makes them more they truly . because this , it not always situation problem , but my own distorted view it . claudio assumptions hero promiscuous nature benedick beatrice quick reaction gossip heard each other two images my own tendency take specific circumstances extreme they should never reach . this play therefore not only enjoyable me read ; it brought light one my strengths times becomes my personal downfall , , making me more conscious this fact , allowed me potential correct it sooner . i wholeheartedly recommend this book , especially those enjoy shakespearean theatre well good laugh . it hilarious story how manipulation our own choice action create complicated labyrinth we unable get out , times don't ever want . shakespeare excellent job poking humor into crevices every situation , lightheartedly reminds us end it our own decisions create , or destroy , mangled outcome we receive .	1

if you like james woods , this definitely float your boat . woods plays ex-hitman , cleave , large business situated los angeles , which means you get see him show his capacities smooth , calculating , also emotionally explosive . while this movie put action category , it should , its plot unfolds itself slowly revealing machinations corrupt powerful business , woods ' character trying take down gyped him some point his service . throughout this development , movie plays characters woods -the cunning dangerous hitman- dennehy -a just but temperamental cop- off one . you guess , dennis , cop , continually suspects cleave some dark secret or cold trick up his sleeve . this movie ability display how dennis communicates cooperates criminal , who he despises , what takes this movie beyond bare action into fascinating portrayal personalities caught larger struggle enforcing justice mega-corporations	1

i video store picked this one up whim , recently become avid foreign film watcher . movie focuses couple ( sergi lopez paz vega ) their stormy relationship . two meet office where he works she just gotten job . things start off well . he gets her family friends . she becomes fast friends his coworker wife ( elvira minguez ) . she becomes pregnant their first child . he sees she smoking one day hits her . this first signs violence only escalates after child born . she confides her friends family , who initially play it off , but soon become worried when she starts show bruises . two get divorce but he continues follow her , when she tries get some justice , court system fails her . she tries make well him but comes realization she dislikes him greatly after all he , leading climactic ending . sometimes melodrama bit cheesy , but you feel her fear she gets no help justice system must take matters into her own hands . lopez effectively portrays man who seems know he wrong , yet can't find way change himself . good performances all around . worth viewing	1

i looking billy elliot more than two years . i heard it should very good or even excellent film reason watching it i seen several working title films before ( boy , notting hill , love actually , four weddings funeral ) i found all them much more sincere emotional than average hollywood products . also these british films something offer you rarely find hollywood movies : charming heartwarming mixture sweet funny comedy inspiring touching drama . last month , finally , i found tape . very first moments movie my eyes riveted screen when movie ended feelings emotions overflowed me . billy elliot my opinion billy elliot brilliant movie , easily one best movies year most likely current decade . director movie stephen daldry brought us exceptional , truly inspiring moving , emotional poignant movie . entire story all characters completely believable atmosphere small provincial town somewhere north-eastern england skillfully captured transmitted us . sometimes movie sad , sometimes it funny but stephen daldry work never leave you indifferent . story occurs small coal-mining town 1984 there signs severe depression all over town . you see all around shadow distress even poverty . some simple but incredibly powerful scenes bring us sad feeling hopelessness even despair . there big coalminers strike town but it easy see it also hopeless strike . but all this only masterfully recreated background main story title character , twelve years old boy . he recently lost his mother both his father elder brother striking coalminers . billy forced his father attend boxing classes one day accidentally he see girl ballet classes occur same room he find ballet much more interesting than hated stupid boxing . so he attends those ballet classes instead boxing there nothing surprising after few weeks his father suddenly finds out billy didn't attend boxing worst all he attending ballet classes . main conflict occurs . billy must fight his choice , fight against his own family . there two stereotypes against him . first one ballet girls , not boys ( lads football ... or boxing ... or wrestling ) . second sounds even worse : all male ballet dancers gays . billy not but no one his family except aged grandma want even heard ballet . there only two people whole town , who support him - middle-aged ballet teacher mrs. wilkinson his friend michael , who same age billy who found he possibly gay . this gay subplot easily became conservative audience very controversial question . but fact such stereotypes not invented director movie if you would try learn more this terrific picture you found jamie bell , who took dance lessons age six , suffered similar sneers taunts . billy problem he must fight not only against bad obstacles misunderstanding but also against strong social stereotypes . several brilliant come scenes bright humor greatly emphasize struggles main hero . jamie bell playing billy best performances ever among young actors . his performance ( particularly dance sequences ) so genuine , bright sincere all time we easily feel expression young boy , not director , choreographer or writer . bafta award best actor year well-deserved it pity conservatism academy too often becomes insuperable obstacle many great movies . julie walters ( academy nomination best supporting actress ) billy ballet teacher also great job talented woman talented women who forced teach small provincial town pitiful salary . chemistry teacher student great line billy elliot . two other important supporting characters - billy father elder brother tony also excellent their evolution perfectly showed stephen daldry direction . beautiful soundtrack perfect combination classic ( including nice reference great swan lake ) modern music . original " " rating shouldn't mislead you . except strong language it should easily pg-13 . but this very rare case where some strong language profanity necessary authenticity characters understanding . movie suitable teens it definitely able give some good lessons them . 10 out 10 looks well deserved . thanks reading sorry my bad englis	1
picture could better but sound amazing this hd-dvd ! i recommend this title any fan genr	1
those who read other reviews yours truly , this review , but i divide science fiction into three categories : true science fiction , science fantasy , science horror . often , science horror could called true science fiction , because it based what could happen . however , true science fiction focused more possibilities human reaction , while purpose science horror movie terrify you . this movie terrify you . this movie excellent job its twists turns plot ; you jump least once time movie over . schwarzenegger excellent villain , linda hamilton michael biehn turn good performances . it also small role beth motta , who i remember exercise instructor 20 minute workout , exercise program . one challenge science fiction dealing time travel into past . this successfully achieves goal . i would recommend this movie	1

i surprised this workout , i actually like it ! i usually find stott workouts too boring but it refreshing using 2 weighted balls pilates routine . moira instructs 3 students who perform exercises different levels , they use balls every single exercise , even pushups when you put one ball your calves one your knees while doing them , end workout i really sweating feeling fatigued upper body but i don't weight train all(i just pilates yoga ) so people who , it might easy . i use 2.2 pound ( 1kg ) balls i bought local store , not stott balls ( it doesn't really matter ) . workout 40 min . stott pilates toning ball workout called " amazing tone " according them theyre very similar except this one few extra exercises supposed " teachers " " avid home exercises " so don't buy both them	1

_triumph will_ ( original german : _triumph des willens_) most infamous propaganda film featuring nazis third reich 1934 nuremberg party rally notorious german film maker leni riefenstahl . movie obviously centers around nazi fascination all-powerful " power " attempts show what accomplished application such political . film features such nazis heinrich himmler , joseph goebbels , rudolf hess , hermann goering but most its focus directed adolf hitler ( " der fuerher " ) . basic point film seems propagandize national socialists showing germany great power strength german military people . film also features appearances s.a. , s.s. , " hitler youth " , all praised hitler himself . most film consists marches german stormtroopers , accompanied music richard wagner ( beloved hitler ) " horst-wessel-lied " or party rallies speeches hitler himself or other notorious nazis . movie also shows much accompanying scenario germany time well featuring scene which farmers dressed traditional garb present fruits their labors hitler . such appeals tradition common among nazis . throughout film , german male soldier/worker presented youthful , exuberant , strong , fertile , powerful . ( some scenes involving young german men frolicking , shaving , even bathing while bare-chested could probably frankly described homoerotic . ) hitler speeches themselves ( well speeches other nazis presented this film ) powerful disturbing . hitler explains his position attempts demonstrate power his party nation . one particularly revealing point , hitler states " state not order us , we order state ! " . other times , various nazi officials express fact " hitler germany " . this sums up cult personality surrounding der fuerher . ( hitler uncanny ability mesmerize people during his speeches commented upon frequently . some maintained hitler himself almost occult influence such times . various theories suggested explain how he came such powers . ) ironically , no point film single anti-semitic phrase uttered . this may intentional . what seen this film though power nazi state military . further , esoteric elements nazi party present , including such features swastika bizarre cult surrounding " blood banner " ( flag carried nazis during beer hall putsch revered nazis since time ) . many noted nazi party itself may constitute form ersatz religion . example , conservative theorist eric voegelin ( who himself escaped germany time ) maintained nazism constitutes " political religion " . such quasi-religious aspects certainly present this film . ultimately though , me least , film pointed out lurking danger may found all crowds group-think . such " herd instinct " overtakes many those present crowd their very selves merge rest crowd , party , nation , german people pseudo-mystical union . thus , may understood mystical aspect national socialist movement , herein , partly lay its appeal . woman who made this film , leni riefenstahl ( 1902 - 2003 ) , interesting enough person herself . begin , one must note time , this film represented advance film technique . indeed , entire film very well put together effectively accomplishes its purpose propagandizing nazis . riefenstahl herself german film-maker who became fascinated nazis time . later , she maintain she politically na�ve largely ignorant sorts crimes they committing ( whether or not she disingenuous this point obviously debatable ) . after world war ii , riefenstahl kept french detention camp some time . she investigated period but never convicted during de-nazification process . later , she would continue produce other works art , but ultimately she remains most ( in)famous this piece . movie itself disturbing one , ultimately , light crimes war . it speaks danger fanaticism . ultimately , despite propaganda presented this film , hitler not serve german people well , betray them very end ( when many innocent germans butchered soviet soldiers ) . this say nothing course hitler other , more notorious , crimes .	1

i wasn't expecting much pulse , such low expectations , i wasn't disappointed . it everything one- or two-star movie could hope . what i find disappointing they good idea somewhere , but everyone working film , top down , seemed miss it . then again , it remake japanese horror classic ( japanese horror films rarely , if ever , make sense ) , so they weren't trying find original story . pity . otherwise quiet college town , suicide rate skyrocketing . eventually our heroes , mattie ( kristen bell ) dexter ( ian somerhalder ) realize there virus , sorts , " system " , odd , silvery specter-like creatures cause it . these creatures , never explained , put themselves face-to-face their victims then it seems they inhale suck some essence their victim , which feeds them - somehow . it makes good viewing , but it doesn't make much sense . because it doesn't make sense , we're not " creeped-out " . since i'm reviewing this dvd , not film , i'm giving it two-stars - because first time i recall , special features subtitled . i'm hearing impaired , i normally miss out special features , even though these special features weren't all exciting , i able watch them .	-1

i am cyclist runner i looking something suppliment rodney yee ( best yoga dvds available ) dvds i . i bought this one specifically because it claimed workout designed different sports . well , it major let down . this tape absolute beginners only . it zero flow it frustratingly slow . they spend several minutes each pose , not holding pose , but just slowly getting you pose then holding it 10 seconds after two or three minutes explanation . its maddening . there no continuity . i would imagine if you true beginner this dvd might marginally useful but once you mastered basic poses it offers , you would then lose interest it because it painfully slow pace . i personally half one hour work out couldn't finish it , it driving me nuts . i went back my rodney yee world right again ....	-1

when i first tracked down copy this film ebay , i bit skeptical . would film live up hype ? could film this many popular voice actors actually inspired ? would this animated movie , fact , change way we'll watch films now ? just 10 minutes into film , i realized answers these questions " yes " , " yes " , " ultrayes " . never before i seen so much emotion animated film .... or even live-action film . finally someonetook advantage medium create work art surpasses quality , craftsmanship , action-packed beauty lively live-action films . there layers . indescribable layers depth . characters , each change frame , each bit dialog , every aspect film seems symbolic -- bleeding effortlessly into each other , into diaphragm american dream . gong creativity gonged . beacon lit . how much longer fiery firesflame ? world we live today , it important films such " my little poney : princess promenade " made . so many others said it better , yet it seems no one able say it all . perhaps it best quote movies final lines ?

early summer not ozu greatest film , it merely my personal favorite . reason simple : noriko mamiya , played incandescent setsuko hara , one most fascinating , perverse , peculiar female characters all world cinema . every viewing early summer peels away new layers her guilelessness , revealing more more quiet audacity . noriko lives her brother ( koichi ) , his wife , her elderly parents , her brother bratty young sons . she dresses simple western styles works typist . koichi imperious man old-fashioned ideas role women , he intimidates whole family . except noriko . not she ever defiant towards him , she simply mastered art smiling deferentially continuing her own inscrutable path life . her family , friends , neighbors , professional associates all take note her age ( 28 ! ) begin pester her getting married before it too late : noriko smiles deferentially every suggestion , insinuation , or act coercion . there even some speculation she might lesbian . one member her family unable advise noriko , shoji , her older brother who . i . . since war presumed ( any reasonable standard ) dead . ozu master evoking what out frame , continually reminding us there unseen world interacts what he allows us see . absent lovingly remembered shoji turns out force points mamiya her groom , man who unites family his absolute unsuitability noriko . my favorite scene , noriko denies her friend aya she love her intended -- then describes her exact feelings him words perfectly define phenomenon love . new subtitles donald ritchie only times preferable ones older prints . one hand , bawdiness some dialogue much more clear ritchie translation , but other hand titles become far more prosaic . sadly , two best lines film all poetry sucked out them this version . i give you original translations , you read ritchie yourself . when koichi finds his two sons abusing loaf bread , translation his outburst used read , " don't kick food ! " lastly , when two elderly mamiyas share sandwich park , they see toy balloon floating off into sky . perfect distillation yasujiro ozu ability draw our attention what off screen , husband line dialogue used , " somewhere child crying . " maybe ritchie more accurate , but one line he should never touched	1

not many films classified both artistically seminal expression national ( or societal ) self , but this particular movie just . not only caligari first really great horror movie , it also one first make its horrific point clearly logically . this way it precursor all horror films since -- or should i say all good horror films . moreover mise-en-scene so radically conceived consistently followed through there not moment it not repay close study . glib comments german expression this film no harm , but they don't get anywhere near finely wrought complexity characters their circumstances . film dated 1920 , very beginning weimar republic furious outburst artistic activity occurred during troubled 12-13 year period which ended take-over hitler his nadsp . caligari expression expressionism all right , but it also declaration who what weimar . other words this movie much political statement artistic intellectual freedom it simple horror flick . see this film enjoy it : that first requisite any artistic work . but don't see it once . see it many times . fun it : try find right angle instance . end , you come conclusion not one frame carelessly placed , not one character miscast , not one moment sheer horror left stand its own . this great filmaking . it also great expression freedom . no film this sort could made anywhere other than germany this moment ; it unique expression optimism died nazis	1
i fond memories this 1969 film because way i first happened see it . when my father stationed japan we would opportunity every couple months go see late show base theater . movie screened never announced ; you just went took your chances . one time it " one more time " ( peter lawford plays lord sydney pepper sammy davis , jr. charlie salt ) time it " beneath planet apes " ( i guessed movie basis opening shot waves coming ashore ) . one night we went movie starts off bunch confederate soldiers waiting attack then comes john wayne leading union cavalry charge we got see " undefeated " weeks before its normal rotation our theater . actually , john wayne not best part this film . opening scenes deal end civil war . wayne plays colonel john henry thomas , whose men followed him texas fight union not sick soldiering ready go home . plan they going put together herd wild horses sell them representatives mexican government , who offering best price . course , mexico might its own civil war . meanwhile , defeat confederacy arrival northern carpetbaggers convinced colonel james langdon ( rock hudson ) his men there nothing left them south . so his plan lead his men their families mexico serve military government emperor maximillian trying hold onto power . two groups former enemies meet way after fighting indians together achieve something rapprochement , mainly because rock duke manly men hit it off . they two big stars acting together , rock upstaging amiable duke just every opportunity . idea what expatriate confederates during after civil war interesting one , but script only deals means setting up rest film . course since former confederates traveling women ex-union soldiers only brought horses , romantic subplots involve overlooking minor past differences war killed half million americans . colonel langdon sister-in-law ( marian mccargo ) grudgingly sparks john henry , despite fact his unit shiloh where her husband killed . but it hard pay attention any notion mature relationship when young charlotte langdon ( melissa newman ) , colonel daughter takes interest blue boy ( l.a. rams quarterback roman gabriel ) , john henry cherokee indian adopted son , which not sit well her beau , lt . bubba wilkes ( michael vincent before he jan-michael vincent , i swear i not make up " bubba " name ) . nfl player , then relatively unknown merlin olsen , plays corporal little george , gentle giant gets fight honor confederacy time time . you also see former miss america lee meriwether colonel langdon wife veteran character actors ben johnson short grub , harry carey , jr. thomas ' riders , royal dano dignified confederate officer . this really 3.5 star movie . it not good i remember there all sorts problematic elements film simply because " undefeated " pretty much doing things numbers . there no big surprises here once you know players it simply question watching it all play out . end i round up simply because scenes wayne hudson , without getting into fascinating sub-text personification american machismo acting opposite biggest hollywood star closet . i seen some evidence duke knew rock secret , but there nothing film suggest it bothered him	1
if you dylan fan don't own this , then run out buy or order now . this not missed . don't look back , shot d.a. pennebaker ( who almost missed chance shoot document , actually , when partner , leah approached albert grossman , dylan manager ) see if they would intresed touring dylan shoot documentary . leah said , " who bob dylan " when pennebaker returned he flabberasted , but thank god all , stubborn grossman returned contract or deal hashed out over hotel napkin ( true story ) . small budget , don't look back lean , mean production what tour really , but it not all sex , drugs , rock ' roll . hardly . fact , it shows dylan coming terms his own fame how he negotiates this how he negotiates his way through reporters , various interviewers ( one famous scene ' science student ' who dylan toyed game cat mouse , who he asked , " why should i want know you ? what could you ever me ? " time , maybe dylan right . it would turn out , our young ' science student ' went form chrysalis records , so bit mistake - dylan lacked some prescience here . here we see dylan thoughtful , philosophical young man - so many terrific scenes here , including meeting wtih donovan , who running theme joke through film ( tidbit imformation , it donavan , baez dylan who wrote cards you see subterranean homesick blues night before hotel room - better cards donovan because he more ' artistically inclined ' according many reliable sources ; regardless , cards all three ... ) . don't look back first " rockumentary " real form ever , pennebaker should applauded rewarded . opening scene simply dylan holding his cards music subterranean homesick blues , what today we would call music video - pennebaker first open film this style . dlb broken down into sections essentially ; we see dylan concert , dylan hotel rooms frinds , notably baez bob neuwirth who his constant side-kick ( would change 66 ); scenes traveling , scenes green rooms , footage fans some towns . but that it : travelperformancehotel roomsinterviewsgreen roomssome country ( though not much ) . i don't want give away too much . perhaps one other compelling reason buy this version it includes book all text dialogue every single shot film which excellent true dylanologist or writer or journalist . buy it . then buy eat document , which folliwng year note diffrence year makes . this book , if you like dylan , then positively you . sadi ranson-polizzott	1

what this movie lacks plot , it makes up visual special effects . i think hype williams took lot criticism conducting this movie like lengthy music video but i think it actually movie strong suit . likewise , i think while movie might not up par " great " gangsta flicks like godfather or scarface , it wisely not try emulate them either . i also liked all-star hip hop cast/cameos such method man , t-boz , nas , dmx , etc . also , i've hooked some movie film like d'angelo " devils pie " acapella version " however you want me ?

i love this movie - makes me wish i born 20 years earlier - when sexy women still called " dames , " styles hair dress classy all way . music best best - this stuff really influenced jazz today - ray eberle smooth vocals , vocal jazz quartet - lets not forget tex benneke ( he hip cat playing tenor sax doing those cool vocals - god , my kingdom zoot suit ! ) . humor priceless , glenn miller actually could act . final number , " kalamazoo " , makes ya wanna get out your chair find someone jitterbug . get this movie get out your saddle shoes :	1
i seen few " angry young brit " movies late 50 early 60 lately . " this sporting life " , " look back anger " , " saturday night sunday morning " leave picture society offers little except tedious life limited rewards . richard harris character " this sporting life " least opportunity reach beyond but he ultimately reminded where he belonged . these movies left me wondering why british life era seemed so incredibly boring while america things really hopping . beatles changed all but then watching " fully monty " gave me impression deadend life returned . it hard get excited all this dreariness but i'm certain directors point make . maybe it dickensian version " youth served " motto . anger , fighting , drinking , love/hate relationships women all portrayed life without joy . personally , i thought " saturday night sunday morning " best lot . although albert finney might slight notch below richards burton harris , i felt his more compelling character ; lost , aimless , but not willing take it sitting down . he seemed care no one but himself ( common trait leading men these movies ) ready sacrifice just anybody keep his life least somewhat enjoyable . burton just plain angry harris obsessed his game but finney used people around him pawns his own entertainment . one those individuals played rachel roberts who played same sort role " this sporting life " . some movies make you happy some make you think . this limited genre film seems make you think you'd happy watch something else instead . yet there life must lived society predetermined where you belong . these movies may impress many viewer i admit acting directing superb all three movies i cited era . however , i came away each one gladder than before i spent those years middle america rather than great britain .	1
if you love romance movie you see this one regency period atmosphere , costumes , settings , beautiful musical score , excellent performances well-chosen cast . it pleasure watch longtime devoted admirer jane austen works , i am very critical any movies based upon her novels , but this one very best adaptations any major literary work .	1
when i considering buying this film , i read all reviews though alot them negative , i decided get it anyway because i am huge fan jane austen books like bbc movies . i very disapointed after watching it ! this one worst movies i seen . i could not believe it ! music much modern time period , they made movie much too creepy , whereas book much more lighthearted , though there some dark parts it . if you're considering buying this , i would advise against it . i hate negative , but watching this movie waste time .	-1

this offbeat story modern day cowboy who falls love minor eventually tries take her away her father . although story centers around relationship harlan ( edward norton ) ( tobe ) evan rachel wood , several other relationships come sharply into play . family dynamic tobe , her younger brother lonnie ( rory culkin ) , her father ( david morse ) , relationship harlan develops lonnie . this film offers realistic , if odd portrayal life . harlan likes think himself cowpoke , making his way ranch ranch , when actually he stuck suburbs san fernando valley working gas station attendant . tobe angry teenager who meets falls love older harlan , against her father wishes . what results beautiful , sometimes almost corny , film relationships , reality , fantasy , how thin line good bad sometimes . if you like independent films actually deliver , theis one you . down valley gives viewers what more movies should : something they haven't seen before . dvd , interview director david jacobson star/producer edward norton provides some insight into writing actual creation film	1
movie " extreme ops " which opened lukewarm reviews even more lukewarm box office really should carry government health warning it . it so mind numbingly incoherent lackluster one feel your brain cells depleted one one after each comic strip moment . let me take back because equate comic strips this piece drivel disservice comic strips . this movie no plot no characterization . point appears display some " amazing " stunt work but effect spoiled over usage truly obvious computer generated effect work would not look out place your home play station . plot , i use term loosely , concerns group commercial filmmakers who travel world attempts catch stunts film . they hired japanese businessman catch shots skier racing ahead avalanche ( reason why never really given ) so this ragtag group heads austria . why they made decision film shot alps instead perfectly good rocky mountains similarly never explained , except it allows them come into contact sneering serbian war criminal fresh faking his own death . understandably sneering villain none happy sharing his mountain hideaway obnoxious group teenagers . he , like theater audience , seems find them just annoying we , but whereas we liberty tuning them out or , even more sensibly , walking out middle movie , he takes more homicidal approach decides away them . i usually try find some good points movie i review so it somewhat balanced , however it hard this flick find something positive say , i guess one could point out girls good looking scenery equally pretty - count ? yourself favor give this miss . i would also recommend you pass it when you see it dvd shelves . there absolutely no redeeming feature this dull , dumb movie	-1

" fair foul , foul fair , " say three witches _macbeth_ , principle holds true film _shampoo_ . released 1975 , one leading members what now called " 70s films , " _shampoo_ story george roundy , hairdresser beautiful sun-blessed city angels . perhaps no other film hollywood placed into more capable hands -- hal ashby , remarkably disciplined but expressive director ( roundy rides his motorcycle through hollywood hills ); robert towne , veteran screenwriter who won oscar _chinatown_ ; warren beatty , one hollywood greats , swordsman renown . film follows roundy he enjoys what he seemingly enjoys most , company women , he seeks start business , his own hair salon . but film , three witches say _macbeth_ , fair foul , foul fair -- which say _shampoo_ , roles reverse appearances deceive . roles reverse central characteristic roundy -- his enjoying company women . roundy world , courter changed courted , courted , courter . why it , or even whether it must or ought perhaps fit discussion -- but it seems hard argue , this reviewer , traditional role guy courtship courter , traditional role woman , courted . roundy world , however , things somehow got reversed . he no courting -- he doesn't stop his movement seeing angelic brunette walking down sidewalk chase her down , he doesn't time his exit bank catch arresting blonde her way out . he no courting . it women who court him . he walking into his shop woman slams her brakes bats her eyes his attention , he waiting one his " friends " ( most likely how he'd introduce her someone ) her house , while he killing time , her daughter comes him . so roundy world , things got themselves reversed . cause reversal significant important understanding roundy . roundy very existence you might say " half free-will " -- half free-will because nearly any matter , he only forced make half decision . constantly courted , he essentially offered decisions approval or rejection . constantly sought-after , half his decision-making process completed him . his life thus whirlwind -- observer point view , he might seen things roundabout fashion . so he ends up sex young daughter , lorna ( played carrie fisher ) , one his friends . how such thing happen ? because he only ever forced make half decision . yet lorna courting him , which she vigor , there lesson well . she comes roundy saying , " wanna ---?" this roundy agrees . however , when one his friends courts him indirectly asking him fix her hair , he turns her down . so lesson seen here , well , roundy thousand one offers any one time , he takes most direct most clearly communicated . thus roles reverse _shampoo_ . but appearances deceive well . perhaps appearances deceive no better way film than manner roundy forced act order start his business . roundy secretly his own master whose altar he must kneel before -- bank . seeking start his own hair salon , he must courting . he must go bank apply loan . it he who doing approaching , it he who conforms standards his master demand him . indeed , no longer it one his friends who putting just right top or just right perfume roundy approval , but it roundy who putting just right jacket putting his raffish hair just right place approval his master -- bank manager . tellingly , he invites none his friends him bank -- he aware his reversed role , he doesn't like it , but there nothing he it . denied his first attempt loan , he must later go see banker , lester ( played jack warden ) . lester husband one roundy friends . here too appearances deceive -- lester believes roundy gay , so lester would quite shocked learn roundy enjoying company his wife . indeed appearances may so deceive this world end deception itself . end _shampoo_ often seen bleak despairing -- roundy shock only person he decides he trust , leaves him , breaks his heart . but roundy heartbreak forever ? it hard not look few months into future see roundy motoring mulholland drive his motorcycle , friend his speeding up beside him her car , flagging him down , smiling devilishly out her car , asking him if he wants --- , roundy suppressing smile , glancing around . glancing what ? nothing . roundy shrugging , then roundy off his motorcycle tailing behind girl her car , already mended , or if not mended , least forgotten -- maybe ! hope ! -- his heartbreak	1
no extras that shame but this still gets 5 stars me . why ? - because second season great it doesn't need extras make it must own fans show . some real classic episodes here color this season . jim artie develop chemistry elevates this show . clever ideas , marvelous stunts terrific art direction this one best shows ever made period . too bad it didn't run 10 years . if not television anti-violence crusade it probably would . long live wild wild west	1
i feel this movie better than first series . very good special effects excellent cast	1
i bought this set rather impulse . i couple " secret agent " dvd love them ( watched , loved , " prisoner " my teens ) . so , knowing those great , surely danger man great too . it , though much different way . i'm watching disks order , so i'm only little ways , but i've enjoyed almost all stories so far . they're bit campy , ( though less so than later series ) ( reviewer noted ) sometimes bit rushed , but generally well written good production values . pat mcgoohan always great . guest actors bit more variable ( few dodgy accents , tendency put ' dark ' make-up anglo actors make them pass indians north africans)but most good job . it especially interesting , first disk or two , see how writers producers ( actors ) gradually settled , making subtle changes they went . ( first couple episodes , they seemed want avoid setting stories any ' real ' places , so they simply avoiding naming them -- leading some bizarre dialogue ' why you visiting our country ? ' ' where you learn speak langauge this country ? ' eventually they apparently decided just make up countries , so we get wide assortment imaginary eastern european , middle eastern latin american locales . ( where , course , everyone speaks fluent english accents . ) looking forward watching more . so why only 4 stars ? least one episodes unwatchable , lots freezing break-ups . , while i suppose i shouldn't complain given price , complete lack extras frustrating . there aren't even any subtitles .	1
this dvd really takes advantage medium help beginning knitter learn basics craft . instruction repeated several times frequent pauses so viewer easily keep up . camera angles excellent , making it easy see what going how it . there also explanations common mistakes how avoid them . there lots good knitting dvds , but i can't imagine better one than this one basics	1
this not " war film " it not " antiwar film . " what malick ( former philosophy student ) * use * setting modern warfare way communicating essence schopenhauer metaphysics ethics . underneath surface observable , individuated phenomena , essence world : non-individuated , passionate yet pointless destructive striving . embodied nick nolte , who lives fight win , while recognizing his way way " nature . " " look those vines , staros , swallowing everything . nature cruel . " true insight into nature , however , leads compassion suffering others , since we all one behind appearances , renunciation desiring ( its inevitable concomitants , conflict suffering ) . denial represented jim cavaziel . according schopenhauer , if one recognizes futility willing but cannot achieve this state complete ascetic denial , only other alternative mitigate one own suffering keeping one expectations low possible . this stance embodied sean penn . first , crucial dialogue penn cavaziel , agenda film placed before us : given world it , should we cling this world despair , or should we turn away it transcend ? penn says , " there no world but this one . " cavaziel replies , " i've seen world . " * * what film : choice mysticism nihilism . film not pro-war , because it assumes schopenhauer , moral justifications war always nothing more than rationalizations more fundamental need violence . film not anti-war , because unlike all other anti-war films , it not set up contrast morally praiseworthy form ordinary life morally repugnant form activity created creating war . if war expression cruelty nature , or reality itself , moral judgment it makes no sense --- one might well condemn jungle jungle . this goes some way toward explaining peculiar detachment film aspires achieves . catastrophe characters caught up world itself , film offers no adequate response it than serenely transcend it	1
cary grant . audrey hepburn . hidden megafortune . three nasty pursuers . slick , chic thriller hitchcockian edge . kind formula , it not surprising " charade " deserves every shred praise it receives -- over years , this classic received lot . director stanlet donen his finest moment when he created this funny , witty , tightly-plotted little thriller , where you're left questions right up final scene . while vacation ski lodge , regina lampert ( hepburn ) decides get divorce . but when she returns home , she finds her husband tossed off train -- even stranger , she finds he mixed up gold robbery many years ago . get her mind off her problems , reggie goes out town peter joshua ( grant ) , guy she met resort . but during her outing , she cornered three strange , creepy men -- worst part , she finds joshua may their plot . unsure whom trust , reggie starts digging find out where gold -- then her pursuers murdered one one . she next target ? it sharp , taut little thriller , reminiscent more commercial thrillers hitchcock , though set chic 1960s paris setting , new wave edge . stanlet donen mostly comedies his career , which makes tight plot wry wit this movie stand out even more . movie moving fairly steady pace , one or two dead spots , but mostly just following twisted plot threads . there some really harrowing moments , like regina attacked hook-man . tense finale , lot odd little clues suddenly fall into place , especially murder three thugs . it brilliant piece scripting , even if storyline bit unreal . fortunately it not all spy-thrills revenge . donen could change action horror comedy moment , he keeps quieter moments lively funny dialogue some sophisticated slapstick , like grant showering fully-clad . witty dialogue full glorious one-liners . " you won't able lie your back awhile , " reggie quips , " but then you lie any position . " though grant wasn't wholly comfortable playing opposite hepburn , two actors kinetic chemistry . whether they're goofing off , or chasing kiss nightclub , they feel entirely real romantic . better yet , nobody knows who grant really or what he doing , so there added element danger their relationship . content quality , criterion collection version undoubtedly best , since film lovingly restored every way . however , it also walletbuster . less expensive but equally restored version , try double-bill " truth charlie " " charade , " just forget you remake all . this tightly-plotted , fast-moving thriller deserves well-loved it , cinephiles should ashamed themselves if they haven't yet seen it . must-have	1

you either love movie or you don't . if you're vod lover , special edition 2-disk release worth every cent . film beautifully restored its " color de luxe " panavision widescreen glory . ( my vhs tape barge making its way staten island landfill i type this ) . second disk includes karioke renderings songs several documentaries featurettes ( all listed above ) . my favorite these " jacqueline susann valley dolls , " which generous film clips depicting chain-smoking failed-actress-cum-bestselling-author speaking herself coming across , more than anything , highly committed indefatigable professional writer ( who used different color typing paper each her six drafts manuscript ) . it easy see how this no-nonsense , get-it-done schlockmeister got under skin procratinating perfectionist celebrity syncophant truman capote . ( i surprised see no mention their long-standing public rivalry anywhere among dvd extras . ) missed opportunity among all extras commentary track disk one . it great barbara parkins ( although her memories seem grown rather dim over years ) . one would liked hear patty duke ( or even leigh grant ) well , though we only guess why fox wasn't able make happen . but commentary could greatly enriched if fox nixed use gossip columnist ted cassablanca ( who stole his nom de plume gay character novel ) engaged truly informed movie critic or film historian co-comment ms parkins . casablanca badgers parkins " dish " other actresses , sharon tate murder , judy garland walking out helen lawson role ; when he not badgering , he cooing her perfume or comparing notes her which actors film they each found " do-able . " ( parkins just closed her eyes during her love scenes thought singer cat stevens england . ) both parkins casablanca surprisingly ignorant basic facts film . i found myself frequently shouting tv screen , " watch disk two--it all explained there ! " among things i still don't understand : why so many people dimiss or discount hayward performance merman-inspired helen lawson ? hayward comes solidly out " women picture " tradition seems perfectly cast . her singing voice , supplied veteran big-band singer margaret whiting ( that mrs. jack wrangler you , ted casablanca ) , perfect match ( raw years backstage smoking ) . but , only explanation i come up ms garland fans so much wanted see her singing role they shun hayward performance out perverse loyalty garland . ( garland died two years after release vod , perhaps adding degree fierceness her fans ' loyalty . ) special edition dvd overemphasizes camp cult elements movie ( " bouncing ball " karioke rendering lawson " i'll plant my own tree " really red wig ends up cartoon toilet final sustained note song ) . such thing make fun viewing once . but movie , movie delicious treat lasts forever	1

review cover dvd reads " snappy , sexy thriller ... " i must disagree . this most unsexy , unthrilling movie i've seen long time . my opinion ashley judd doses not fit this roll , it almost comedic . twisted poorly written losely held gether okay acting . seems actors doing best they could what they . i no doubt producers director felt story potential but they failed realize this production . film ending holds interesting twist but too many lose ends left viewers imagination . my vote ? just okay , nothing write home	-1
this movie not sequel dances wolves ! it just same movie except instead indians these samurais !! course , this movie more action than dances wolves , more warfare , more cool fights more blood !!! i could say last samurai better than dances but only because action , story little predictable but still interesting . . : if you seen dances wolves then you obviouslly note differences this one dances , but basically they same . adios .	1

" herr beethoven , i waiting over two hours deliver this most urgent message ! " composer appeared genuinely confused , " you must mistaken , i only away few moments ! " he then snatched message out boy hands slammed door . my mind , this fine example pure genius work . immortal beloved ( 1994 ) upon its theatrical release panned professional critics over top ; gary oldman overacted director ( bernard rose ) use too many clich�s tell speculative story secret lover beethoven . early nineties time where it fashionable negative critical just everything ... fashionable cynicism . viewed dvd first time since seeing film ( over 12 years ago ) theatre , there no doubt these " professional critics " way off mark . this excellent film manages capture beginnings romantic age music . beethoven right cusp classical romantic movements ... tragedy heroism which mark sensibilities romantic movement stands well represented this moving film . gary oldman one gifted actor portrayed mad genius realism intensity it so well deserves . beethoven music all alone without knowing anything composer continue move audiences ' until end time , however , tragic fact maestro stone deaf while composing majority his music , particularly , ode joy , absolutely astonishing ! it known he actually sawed legs off grand piano , bringing it floor order " feel " vibrations clearer . isabella rossellini countess absolutely superb stunning her eyes convey so much emotion when her character talks her love , maestro . there some beautiful scenes old vienna film , well , this would greatest sound track all time . this wonderful film , love story more than likely greatest romantic history : ludwig von beethoven .	1

i actually think this 2001 low-budget , indie film quirky charm that hard resist , credit goes director/writer/editor brad andersen singular filmmaking style . it ostensibly contemporary love story two misfits , but he laces plot science fiction elements seem contrived first until they start affect characters tangibly . irony these far-fetched plot developments what make movie resonate emotionally . two people center ruby weaver , single woman unfortunate track record enabling men meet her lowest expectations , sam deed , stranger dubuque who may either mentally ill or time traveler year 2470 . ruby immediately drawn sam sincerity but when he confesses coming future , she inevitably feels like she recycling old behavior trying save him his delusions . it reminds me bit john carpenter 1984 " starman " ( where alien takes form woman dead husband ) touch hal ashby 1979 " there " ( where insulated gardener tries make sense world around him ) . however , anderson puts his own idiosyncratic stamp movie making sam seemingly insane assertions credible ruby attraction alternately frustrating empathetic . acting two leads helps considerably here . suffering premature oscar ejaculation , marisa tomei slowly recovered her acting credentials , this performance among her best she dexterously brings out all hesitation vulnerability ruby . sam , vincent d'onofrio tempers his trademark intensity genuine sweetness makes his child-like wonder believable . holland taylor effectively tones down her sassy persona play ruby impervious therapist , while tovah feldshuh grounds film warmth sensibility ruby mother . ending clever nice use stop-motion photography , even if it felt slightly derivative legendary " star trek " episode where bones stopped saving peace-loving missionary ( played joan collins , all people ) killed . this one more infectious than you may assuming set-up	1

this workout really good my opinion . it very squat-intensive . reasons i like it : - although when you first watch it , it seems simple rather slow , it really kicks your butt . reason kicks your butt because all squats other moves require lot leg strength . she good job engineering weight bearing moves aerobic fashion - quite feat , i think . - moves simple easy follow . she good showing them you first giving you warning before change . - even though moves simple , it still fun challenging . - it nice long cardio workout . sometimes i skip this section middle not terribly aerobic ; even skipping sculpting routines end , aerobic part comes 45 minutes , i believe . - ab section quite good . it 13 minutes long . - i believe she only miscounts once . - there really only one time , i think , where camera cuts during transition or new move .	1

" butch cassidy sundance kid " one best films ever made fox recently released fitting two disc dvd edition film . fitting because dvd one best i ever seen . directed george roy hill written william goldman , god screenwriters , " butch cassidy sundance kid " stars paul newman , robert redford katharine ross . how could film this pedigree anything but good ? what you may not realize , or know , this film made robert redford star he today . paul newman , already established star appeared " hud " , " cool hand luke " " hustler " , among others , bankable star film made because he agreed make it . initially , he wanted play sundance kid , but eventually settled role cassidy . robert redford not new film , but he nowhere near icon he would become . he some early success which followed few clunkers . pair became match made heaven would go appear more films together . screen , they appear friends , much like their characters , this adds charm their relationship . redford clearly recognizes influence this film his career . his famous film academy film festival named after his character film . butch sundance decide rob mail car train owned powerful rail baron . butch tired work wants retire , but he needs one or two big scores set him up . after blowing up rail car , they run off loot hide out small town , brothel they frequent . meeting up rest their gang , they quell revolt decide one more job . they rob same mail car same railway , its next run through area . it perfect crime , no one would suspect same train robbed , so it probably loaded money . after blowing up car second time , they notice locomotive speeding towards them crew men horseback alight car give chase , chasing butch sundance , their two accomplices , days , across many terrains . finally , they realize rail baron hired famous indian tracker help band men , including former sheriff who now famous bounty hunter , catch duo . after chase , they return home ella ( katharine ross ) , sundance kid girlfriend . tired , they decide leave country travel bolivia begin robbing banks there . i watched this dvd " butch cassidy " , two things quickly became apparent . this film virtually timeless . lone exception song " raindrops keep falling my head " , film could've made yesterday , images so clear . second dvd print one most beautiful transfers i ever watched . cinematography conrad hall ( who would later work " american beauty " among others ) simply stunning brings out all rich detail landscape . everything crisp clear , when it supposed , colors bright vivid , it just beautiful watch . it doesn't hurt stars two most handsome men ever appear film , prime their careers , one most beautiful women ever co-star . how anyone get past all eye candy ? key becoming fully invested this film william goldman screenplay . he introduces characters action , we learn we go , they almost always moving , or doing something . goldman fills their mouths witty dialogue , showing us how their relationship works , they instantly likeable us . this basically love triangle ross ' ella playing go-between . two men very close friendship , enjoying each other company . but cassidy loves ella well , even appears slightly jealous until he realizes his friend recipient this woman love , so they get . then , there famous chase . railway baron men chase butch sundance days , taking up significant chunk film . but this scene proves us how committed two men each other makes their future trek bolivia all more believable . we believe there real threat these men never let up chase , if they catch butch sundance , they killed . soon they reach bolivia , goldman lot fun characters again , exploring their relationships , rebuilding them way , making them light hearted again . it almost amazing watch this film because if studio executive presented same screenplay today , it would probably not made . it doesn't hit plot points pre-determined pages , it tells unconventional story , we never actually see villains . goldman luxury writing this film during period which studios still able work somewhat unconventional screenplays . course , they wanted make money well , but they still considered film art form . george roy hill underappreciated director . i think large part this because many his films very humorous . comedy not highly respected hollywood drama , even though making good comedy much more difficult . so i suspect humorous elements most his films made him less respected hollywood , but when your films good " butch cassidy sundance kid " " sting " , you deserve some respect . he made his share duds , but when he passed away few years ago , hollywood robbed talent ready make least few more classics . during this period , big screen westerns becoming unpopular . perhaps dearth television westerns keeping public out theaters , but this genre considered risky time . recent films starring burt lancaster others failing light box office fire . second disc contains new " making " feature including interviews newman , redford , ross , former studio executives david brown richard zanuck more . zanuck reveals he took real chance greenlighting this film , but fought it all way . he also haggled hill filmmakers , attempt keep budget under control ; he became concerned when film projected cost $7.5 million ( consider average studio film now costs least $125 million ) . but film would go big hit . such huge hit filmmakers followed this equally popular " sting " . second dvd also contains some archival interviews stars , some trailers more . " making " documentary , they discuss inclusion song " raindrops keep falling my head " . people fought against it but hill composer burt bacharach felt it would perfect accompaniment scene butch ella riding new-fangled bike through her barn yard . it work , but it clearly not fit period depicted film , most dated element within film today . it just seems silly today . " butch cassidy sundance kid " superlative example treatment all classics should receive dvd . this film every dvd library should	1

this just okay , " one-view " film . it beautiful look , so i wouldn't deprive anyone chance view it . but it not film you'll happy own , my opinion . this especially true if you're into bdsm scene yourself . my problem it ? it too shallow -- all costumes performances need flashy . this film actually intended " shock " but it rather surburban . i hate tone " let go check out leather-costumed weirdos . " it rather condescending exploitative , actually . story young man sent undercover investigate " scene " who predictably ( unrealistically ) becomes involved domina played lovely turner ( who some viewers may remember ball cap wearing lesbian girl go fish ) . all characters utterly without substance , paper thin , portrayed very stereotypical fashion . s/m underworld treated over-glamorous flashy way , emphasis again costumes make-up stage performance . this might actually work better broadway musical , like john water " hairspray . " if you want see sensitive heartfelt portrayal s/m , check out japanese film " moonlight whispers . " there , director writer , deeper understanding romantic psychological elements bdsm . film doesn't portray us all like bunch carnival freaks -- media would like believe . so rent " preaching perverted " view once , but buy japanese film " moonlight whispers . " i promise you'll truly love it . it may only authentic , non-exploitative film ever made male submission/female dominance -- so far , it best one .	-1

when compared man fire domino you understand this one those movies where average joe life gets flipped upside down when he intercepts very politically , potientially deadly , threatening materials . minute we find ourselves plugged into this man world we introduced several people who keeping tabs him 24 hours day . they wait outside trucks , bugging him , tapping him , questioning him , even picking up satiliete images pin-point his exact location . it gives all new meaning words " overactive paranoia . " but , domino , it related most becuase domino , well , someone normal who evoked change her boring life . this story man who didn't ask his life changed . whihc makes him perfect everyday hero , my humble opinion . enjoy	1
i liked tomcats all its pure cheesiness , then you too enjoy buying cow . it bit far-fetched , but if you're mood mindless entertainment take you away after horrible day work , this flick trick . also , if you like ryan reynolds , he hilarious this . side note other ladies , you get see him naked which always wonderful plus my book . he looks gorgeous ! jerry o'connell character seems very similar his character tomcats , but he still great fun . thing i really liked how they showed jerry o'connell meeting airport girl his dreams his point view well later film , her point view . i thought nice touch . though certainly quite far best movie i've ever seen , price ( found it $5.50 bin wal-mart ) it great addition any dvd collection	1
peter hyams ' remake richard fleisher 1952 narrow margin focuses more atmosphere scenery than it film noir . it make cool , if bit too short , movie . gene hackman loudmouth deputy da desperate get big daddy mob boss behind bars . when shy book editor witnesses mob assassination he treks out middleofnowhere , canada drag her into court testify . problem arise when bad guys show up wilderness blow crap out her cabin . brilliant , rustic car/chopper chase down sheer slopes mountain forest follows . it great scene some cool shots sharp editing . once they reach bottom mountain they find train station board train private cabin . bad guys follow , only they still don't know what their witness looks like . many scenes hiding seeking make up rest movie . it doesn't sound like much but peter hyams ' widescreen photography used max promote sense claustrophobia even quieter scenes dominated sound train charging through dark canadian wilderness . one particular scene monashee station really take advantage ' middle nowhere ' feeling . bruce broughton score kind okay , but nothing loud exciting score he originally created . peter hyams disagreed ( he often his composers ) chopped up broughton work post-production . thus , music movie more underscore much more action-based cues missing . i wish it last longer more scenes train ( coz trains cool ) but , what it , narrow margin tightly wrought thriller gene hackman top form always fun playing older guy suit who still get into fights car chases if it his everyday job . filmed panavision dvd 2.35 : 1 anamorphic widescreen dolby 2.0 soundtrack . though 5.1 would better there still some surround use . r2 dvd universal also better cover art than r1	1

there many surprises this year academy awards . one biggest absence nominations several films , most noticeably this one . containing no sex , no nudity , no bad language , no gore , no grand action scenes , minimal comedy , non-descript sountrack , only several seconds violence , this movie none hallmarks top movie . but top movie it ; it sat atop box office charts month everyone who seen it comes away impressed . this one those movies stands out its inventiveness , its innovative mode storytelling , its twists turns many points plot , ability make viewer empathize all main characters . great movies themes , this movie multiple . first obsession , not necessarily revenge , but also winning , best , what others more . second rivalry . many movies tried show how friendship evolves into deadly rivalry . examples include star wars : revenge sith , gods generals cleopatra . none these job good this movie . neither character , alfred or angiers , good , neither bad . both professionals trying reach top their professions , if this means backstabbing each other , so it . third sacrifice ; everyone sacrifices more than necessary achieve their ends , result all around lost loves lost lives . most impressive aspect this movie its mode storytelling . 1980 , pulp fiction came out introduced circular method showing movie . then came sixth sense 1990 method flashback end redefined entire movie get-go . then there star wars movies ; sequels first then prequels later . now we prestige ; three different storylines spliced together create play time . movie great , dvd good . no extra or deleted scenes , just interviews , explanations special effects , poster art . overall , great watching experience	1
i've watch " green street hooligan " several months ago thought it good movie but this film like rush blood head . " football factory " ultimate head blowing , jaw clenching , white knuckle ride film . this film all elements make up night exciting viewing , though provoking characters , witty dialogue energized music watch boys batter each other . begin theirs tommy , fast approaching 30 not clue what his sad little life , only thing he�s clinging onto next big meet billy bright foul mouthed , bad tempered geezer who lost ability engage his brain long time ago , he�s only comfortable using his fists . rod who stellar performance restaurant , acts perfect side kick tommy , bill farrell perfect gentleman bygone era harris mean-faced leader who could vinnie jones breakfast , plays distant yet commanding leader . but i like young kid who plays zebberdee , scaly living like vermin depths south london , this all credit acting it must difficult play someone who so detrimental society very little redeeming features . credit must given all actors they all deliver stellar performances what must most unglamorous locations . there isn't one performance i would say weak they all hold audiences attention gage us into what they doing saying . i found violence fashion very realistic . " football factory " more than just football , its loyalty , sense belonging this dysfunctional world .	1

i this workout once week , over 100 fitness videos i own makes it one most used . it only 19 minutes long , not too terribly tough but i feel it working . i only tried few winsor pilates videos but this one i like most far . mari winsor leads you through this workout joined some her instructors her hollywood studio . she starts side kick series , which includes front/back kicks , bicycle , leg lifts , big small circles , hot potato . then she move into some inner thigh work inner thigh lifts , then you lift both legs up later lowering bottom leg up down , then you finish off scissors . next segment called fetal thighs . you start your legs fetal position leg lifts , then you more leg lifts but knee pointed downward , this followed clams , elevated clams , yet more elevated clams but adding leg lift . entire side kick fetal thigh series repeated other side before you finish out leg beats final stretch . i like this routine , it short point . there times i need short pilates those time crunches days , this fits bill . if you pick one winsor pilates video , this best one my opinion . highly recommended	1

i going automatically immediately buy this film because it presented mondo macabro , name i learned really respect trust . mm introduced me now half-dozen astonishing films i'd previously never even heard . well , i hesitated buying this because mixed reviews here amazon . so , i rented it first netflix . well , i watched it last night . this movie totally solid , replete suspense , beautiful venues , awesome music soundtrack , some scantily clad women , exotic atmosphere which many us love these european films . there surreal ambience this genre which totally addictive , thus i every mario bava , jean rollin , dario argento film print , most jess franco stuff well . what sometimes lacking plot more than compensated scenery dreamy weirdness . ( i actually like these movies despite common theme murders women , not because them . i realize danger , evil diabolical acts necessary create tension , just dirty harry-type movie . this movie particular , however , only showed two women killed , only one murders graphic . these scenes certify bad guy bad , but they certainly aren't my favorite scenes . i know some fans these movies like spectacular gore . i personally don't enjoy it . ) anyway , i suspect negative reviews this film come people who more into hollywood big productions lots special effects big name actors like bruce willis , steven segal , billy crystal , bambi . if you already determined you enjoy hidden treasures heyday " euro-trash " films ( totally ironic epithet due fact these categorically most artistic films ever made ) , you enjoy this film . it may not your absolute favorite , but you absolutely glad it your collection .	1
my only reservation this program i would liked more circumstances behind sam death . he very influential singer business person , but he also man . may too much certain people stomach . fact program features interviews sam family shows it approved - also mean it whitewash , sanitised public consumption . fine line walk . just like kennedy assassination , one gets feeling there still more told . i believe writer peter guralnick writing book sam if it anything like his books elvis , it compellng reading . great program worth watching whether or not you fan this wonderful singer who may never reached his true potential	1

anchor bay makes some fantastic dvd editions classic horrors , great price . their necronomicon editions evil dead films , well their special editions dawn dead suspira worth every penny . i bit disappointed see this new edition re-animator only because it third special edition , it doesn't contain much others don't ( just one featurette ) . addition limited edition syringe hilighter great idea , it looks really funky . however , inside box dvds standard plastic keep case , which i happen hate . i'd rather cardboard folder packaging than plastic keepcase , which looks so cheap . least cardboard cd cases , you get all over full colour print , without plastic covering . also , there no inserts inside package save single slip cardstock print one side , chapters other . if you want keep higlighter dvd , you keep them both box . it not flip cover dvd box either - just regular box crushes easily . movie , if you fan , remains fantastic . commentary ( which appeared three versions date ) very good - i liked comparing director point view , experiences actors . three principles clearly great time working together , they plenty say making film . there only one special edition bride re-animator i'm aware , i missed getting copy when it released few years ago . now first film released again special edition package , i'm very hopeful we'll see better edition bride than bare bones one currently available . that really most exciting part this new release .	1

this movie probably gets overlooked because title , which seems incredibly dull unimaginative such cool flick . i think it should called quot ; superatomic submarine vs . flying saucerquot ; because what movie really it sounds much more exciting . movie everything fan 50 sci-fi b-movies would want . story unique twist flying saucer theme because this saucer travel under water , you get two classic sci-fi vehicles price one because this flying saucer takes futuristic ( remember this 1950 ) submarine . parts take place inside saucer very creepy . during these scenes , pitch black background cool creepy music used maximum effect . there few funny lines movie , especially ones where hero talking alien who , way , not disappoint those who love cheesy cool aliens their sci-fi movies . i three words b-movie fans : see it now	1

this dvd 3 famous concertos brahms , tchaikovsky , sibelius . beside , it also beethoven " kreutzer " sonata ( rehearsal ) , beautiful capricci locatelli , piece lalo , one kreisler . so , what more you need one dvd ? compare many dvds ( cds ) , i believe oistrakh played 3 concertos above best . like sibelius concerto , this issue much better than ferras or vengerov dvds , better than heifetz or marcovici cds . moreove , sound quality amazing good .	1
this fine swordplay movie directed sammo hung . i enjoyed movie because its mix action , romance exotic locations costumes . fight sequences fast moving fun watch . i especially enjoyed seeing maggie cheung action . romance movie equally strong adds emotional element action sequences often missing other movies . if you don't generally like action movies because all there fighting , you might like this movie . i listened mandarin soundtrack , but spot checks cantonese soundtrack showed it might marginally cleaner . subtitles white part picture , so they can't turned off . however they very clear i didn't notice any quot ; polar bear snow stormquot ; effects subtitles becoming unreadable . this movie i would recommend action fans superhero fans alike	1
book upon which this dvd based come back into limelight post-enron , pos t-t yco , post-refco , post-worldcom , post-adelphia world ethicless business . dvd gets this part book right . like major rich characters this dvd , today ruthless robber-barons , cheat their wives , demean their employees , spend money lavishly conspicuous consumption . but gatsby never gave million dollar party like head tyco . so much similar : no one knows where rich people money coming . everyone assumes there something illegal few people all money poor people pushed further into poverty . but , no one seems doing anything it . when general motors steps away its commitment employee pensions , united airlines , ibm , this book becomes more more contemporary . even more so when executive pay rises double digits every year . tom buchannan , adulterer this classic , would fit right into today business elite . gatsby ( robert redford ) himself mysterious , but , although his background first world war revealed book , it not found film . his background turns out similar many veterans who returned vietnam , or iraq , find rules business changed , most part , there no effective enforcemen t.t he real lesson this dvd wages sin death . gatsby dies case mistaken identity . his death triggered buchannan infidelity . this message america needs see . i watched this film when it came out . but before enron . i rented vhs watched again after internet bubble burst , just like stock market imploded 1929 , shortly after book written , sweeping millions into poverty . time book became popular , thousands people who hoped like gatsby living streets . if they read book during depression they would happy gatsby got what coming him . what you think gatsby when you see dvd	1

say " cop thriller hong kong , " most cinemaphiles smile , recalling some best " kung pow , " " chop sockey , " plain old ultra-action films ever made . this " can't-go-over-the-top-enough " cradle such restrained filmmakers john woo ( " hard boiled , " " killer , " " better tomorrow " ) . dazzling action sequences high body counts hallmark stereotypical movie this sub-genre . " infernal affairs " takes all stands it its head .

i remember these 6 episodes , which famously known " ones without john cleese " . this probably main reason they've never widely televised us . i remember only seeing them once great while , while watching them , i didn't realise cleese wasn't them , because they absolutely hilarious , they just good anything python ever produced . cleese gone , palin jones took over writing , deliberately made long form sketches , i.e. story thread running throughout whole programme . this works brilliantly michael ellis , light entertainment war , mr. neutron . sketch " anything goes " song light entertainment war side splittingly funny . mr. neutron show gets hilarious digs us ( something pythons weren't really known doing ) , michael ellis brilliant one buying ant . i get somewhat annoyed people who dismiss these episodes afterthought , because they stand their own any other python episode . after show ended , jones palin went onto ripping yarns , which many similarities these 6 episodes . i remember taping these 6 episodes while they comedy central , because i afraid i would never see them again . but i dvd now , so i'm ok .	1
if you've never encountered robert anton wilson , skip this dvd buy yourself copy illuminatus ! ( fiction , writen robert shea ) or quantum psychology ( non-fiction ) . if you're already fan wilson work , you're unlikely learn anything new here ; but you'll probably enjoy yourself all same . if , like me , you never got chance met wilson person , this probably close we'll get sitting down chat elderly " uncle bob " . there also random assortment material varying quality earlier his life . my recommendation brief : read some his books first , then leave this video playing your tv you go your daily chores let uncle bob worm his way into your brain	1
probably everyone one favorite movie they consider " their own " because few , if any , their friends share their admiration it . mine this one . i just love this film . it only one out over 5,000 movies either rented or purchased i watched back-to-back nights after seeing it first time . dozen viewings later , it still just good , if not better . it , star t-t o-finish , most entertaining crime movie i ever watched . fan film noir , those wonderfully-narrated crime films ' 40s ' 50s , romeo bleeding right up my alley . i may wrong but believe this whole film simply parody film noirs : outrageous take those movies over-the-top villain ( lena olin , most fascinating female i ever come across film ) , over-the-top characters , action scenes , dialog narration . it wild , fun - albeit sick - ride , not taken seriously ( which lot people then thought it too goofy ) . evidence this film-noir spoof dialog , number fantastic dark-humor lines , many delivered olin . one see this number times catch all humor here . kudos screenplay writer hilary henkin her work . oldman superb its glue holds this unique story tact . his narration , including exaggerated inflection his voice , fantastic . i appreciate american accent this british actor used , too . olin , russian hit- woman mona demarkoff , she one character i guarantee you not ever forget . roy scheider , annabella sciorra , juliette lewis , michael wincott others - cameos dennis farina ron perlman - all deliver great performances lines , well ,.... i said , outrageous . if you love old film noirs , please check this movie out remember it tongue-and-cheek .	1
i loved first two dvds this anime this one continues story effectively gives good backstory rosette , chrono , joshua . ( first two episodes pure flashback which tad annoying , but effective making joshua sympathetic . ) next episode gabriel hound which coolest vehicle yet . last episode standard christmas special focusing azmaria . reason i don't give this five stars it not nearly funny first two dvds , while last episode light az annoys me , watching dub ( i usually check both dub sub . ) satella worst german accent history . i mean worse then asuka evangelion du	1

i loved this movie . sure , there gore , but not overdone . story took prescedence . angst younger brother familiar every family . his angst happen fitting family monsters , but audiance could relate subbing anything . wilder , older siblings painted picture rebellion sewing wild oats almost everyone age group goes through . everytime audiance relates regular family attributes , monster part movie reminds us this horror film . this very good , entertaining movie . it fresh horror movie mostly original twist . i never bored or felt killing overkill . i would recommend this movie every true horror fan , especially those who tired slasher movies no story	1

... if howard hawks proud making this . sure cary grant didn't seem happy playing this part . i can't think any good actor who'd enjoy lured into such preposterous plot which should got sheridan some oscar impersonating one most insufferable bitches screen ( there no shortage , but very few less funny ) although responsibility more lederer disappointing script . this opinion first 15 min . only , since i don't know if it gets better afterwards , but i couldn't stand it any longer : last 5 min ( 15 ) ordeal .	-1
this dvd based bob anderson well-known book same name . it provides solid introduction basic athletic-type stretch , albeit rather dry manner . dvd nicely chaptered ; i've listed chapters ( times given menu ) added my own short descriptions below . getting started , 7:09 . this short educational segment stretching which begins showing people engaged various athletic activities stretches ( somewhat dated-looking ) . bob anderson then comes screen reviews his philosophy stretching . he emphasizes stretching not exercise stretches should feel comfortable all times ; he focuses " easy " " developmental " stretches opposed " intense " stretches . bob also introduces his two models , marlon debbie . neck back stretches , 12:14 . this first segment , bob leads marlon through series very gentle stretches back , mostly reclined position . there no neck-specific stretches , but bob reminds you keep your neck alignment your back . legs , groin , hips , feet stretches , 12:30 . here , bob leads debbie through nice series standing sitting stretches lower body . most stretches held longer duration ( 15 seconds ) , bob also includes instructions massaging your feet , although only one foot demonstrated . upper body stretches , 10:20 . this my favorite stretch segment . starting kneeling moving standing , bob again leads marlon , this time focusing stretches shoulders , neck , torso ; it ends nice upper body twist . everyday stretches ( daily routine ) , 12:29 . this final segment instructed bob alone via voiceover . here , bob includes stretches each above segments form nice full-body routine . however , because there more stretches included , he also moves more quickly through each stretch ; i would liked see some longer holds here . addition , i found music quite distracting jarring , it alternated loud bells/chimes no music all , which i not feel very conducive relaxation . soemthing this dvd didn't really " click " me ; mentioned above , i found it quite dry ( bob barely cracks smile entire time ) thus not very relaxing . however , this solid athletic stretch dvd could very useful someone who looking short stretching routines incorporate into their fitness regimine and/or daily life	1

there number films underdogs world . most them comedies . necessary roughness one them . it how texas state university lost its championship status due cheating , steroids , pay-offs , etc . therefore , entire team expelled tsu . new recruits actual student-body . coach riggendorf ( robert loggia ) said , " mass suicide ! " team made up bunch misfits way-out individual characters . president tsu ( fred dalton thomson ) wanted ed " straight-arrow " gennero ( hector elindonzo ) lead new team . but there catch . dean ( larry miller ) insist applying strict rules ; ie : " no pass , no play . " ( referring their grade-point-average ) so number students try out team . fair batch made it too . but since most players didn't make grade , they kicked team dean . forced them play what called " ironman football " ; where team plays both offensive defensive . not easy feat . also , they needed really good quarterback . so coach rigg enlisted paul blake ( scott bakula ) , who best high-school . sadly , he give it up when his father passed away , take over family farm . tsu armadillos begin some serious football playing against other universities/colleges their area . but some hilarious commentary chuck niederman ( rob schneider ) pressbooth . they even manage get football player/science professor join ( sinbad ); well lucy place-kicker ( kathy ireland ) . all they want achieve football life win least one game . blake wants his fellow teammates feel what he high school - just even once . i find movie amusing even downright funny . cast characters hoot .	1

i believe it observed , more than once variety ways , all life like gigantic mirror . we see ourselves , everywhere . , if we beautiful ( inside , where true beauty lives ) , then we see beauty everywhere we look . life beautiful puts this idea test . it posits carefree , happy-go-lucky book salesman who romances well-to-do lady mussolini italy ( film starts just onset wwii ) . he weds her , they rear child , they soon put into jeopardy due his jewish heritage . ultimately , they sent concentration camp where his carefree , imaginitive unceasingly joyful attitude only things keep him , his son , utter despair . humor ? romance ? carefree ? nazi death camp ? some , this blasphemous . but makers this film , our lead character , life beautiful , this vision taken their perspective . film manages show there joy , love beauty -- even worst imaginable conditions -- testament way which film succeeds , also basic truth message . yes , things may awful ( more often then not , they ) ... but yes , also : life beautiful . this film gets my highest recommendation . five stars	1

this excellent film adaptation excellent play . produced 1958 , it feels fresh , important modern -- minus few anachronisms -- today it then . paul neumann elizabeth taylor star brick maggie , career-defining roles which they received oscar nominations . they supported equally talented cast ; i particularly enjoyed madeline sherwood sister-woman , strident , manipulative matriarch ever-expanding brood " no-neck monsters " . purists note changes made script make movie palatable movie audiences time conform hollywood production code . while it water down things bit , i've seen filmed versions truer source material but lack power depth this adaptation . dvd doesn't come oodles extras , but ones present worth viewing .	1

actually , i thought " penny dreadful " most innovative film after dark horrorfest certainly not worst ( would " hamiltons , " hands down ) . i went whole route " 8 films 2 die 4 , " catching all eight films their first showings each day , buying my tickets advance get free t-shirt , then waiting monster it depicted show up one films ( it never happened ) . films while we got our free pop refills ( i recommend just getting your large drink filled up halfway so you make it all way through movie ) , we would sit around dissect each film make recommendations ( " audition " film most mentioned ) . end festival my impromptu straw poll found " penny dreadful " much support any other film " best show " title would earn one eight general release . we thought they would go " dark ride " most commercially viable bunch , but they ended up picking " abandoned , " which its own uniqueness heroine mature woman twice age title character this film . this third movie second day i should explain we running gag going regarding connection women cars established these films . first day ended " dark ride , " which involved heroine driving mini-van through wall right time right place save day . second day started " gravedancers , " which same thing happened ( i think it suv time ) . followed " abandoned , " which begins ends woman driving giant farm truck . so time " penny dreadful " started we all chuckling fact characters such small vehicle because it just standard car . car question driven orianna volker ( mimi rogers " ginger snaps " ) , psychologist who trying get penny dearborn ( rachel miner " guiding light " ) over her phobia cars . we find out via flashbacks she car accident claimed lives her parents , so she good reason traumatized experience want avoid driving around car again . but orianna taking penny road trip help her get over her phobia . penny stop every gas station way so she puke up her guts then things get worse . when orianna clips pedestrian lonely stretch mountain road she figures least she give guy ride . fact his face obscured hood he skewer meat him not set off alarm bells orianna telling rest us this big mistake ( you seen commercial where guy picks up hitchhiker ax because guy carrying bud light claims it just opener ? ) . now you know full well given this setup orianna going dead penny going face hitchhiker . what you not expect most film going take place little car ( not ask how maniac set up this scenario , just go it ) . point you thinking there not much you given this scenario , but i think you pleasantly surprised . director richard brandes ( " out blood " ) co-wrote screenplay diane doniol-valcroze ( " kill inches " ) . there not lot horror films come up such simple scenario then stick it ( i always think stephen king short story " survivor type " novel " gerald game " examples one note take extreme approach ) . yes , initial requisite bad decision compounded series other fatal errors ( i believe i actually said " drive rims " out loud theater ) , but fortunately this 2006 horror film relies more penny phobia specific situation play out story . given penny phobia i bet you think you know exactly how this movie got end , but ending this movie not go obvious . again , this speaks determination brandes go against expectations come up something different . i certainly appreciated audacity doing slasher film where most action set around car stuck woods . net result not great horror film , if your taste runs extreme gore films like " saw iii , " " wolf creek , " " hostel , " et al ., then this one going seem dreadfully tame . but i pleasantly surprised hopefully most you who decide check out " penny dreadful " dvd feel same	1
it doesn't matter if you watched original , harvey birdman takes all members hanna barbara family brings them modern maturity . fred flintstone mob boss , inch high private eye discriminated work place . classic concepts adult humor only brains adult swim could create . not mention one best theme songs	1
rest stop horrible movie . sure there many killings , some decent amount gore creativity , but doesn't make up bad plotline less than pleasing cast . end alternate ending both make no sense whatsoever , after watching this movie , you'll wonder why u wasted your money how anyone could've thought this good movie	-1
it funny claude rains shot fame " invisible man " when we only see him few seconds end movie . but such power james whales movie . just directed frankenstein mr. whale given free run this project he ever take it run . this still very powerful movie wicked humor it still make you blink quality f/x time . add deep rich voice claude rains you get classic first order . problem none other films live up promise first they really not good , most falling into comedy even if they weren't ment too . still they worth look because first movie belongs beside other monster collections	1

guillermo del toro ( who directed last years phenomenal pan labyrinth ) seems his best when dealing paranormal ; indeed , he uncommon gift making fantastic seem plausible . this film contains some most haunting believable images i've seen screen , their efficacy heightened director understanding when enough enough . ghost stories any kind fail when real or imagined ghost absurdly presented . most today contemporary " master horror " fail miserably . it 1939 , spanish civil war its final days . carmen doctor casares run orphanage boys ( one wonder , why no girls ? ) . institution remarkable feature : middle courtyard bomb , tip which embedded firmly ground . bomb fell sky during raid , but never exploded . it sits there , disarmed yet immovable , reminder violence outside world . carlos , ten year old , left orphanage , though carmen argues they no resources more children , she accepts him assigns him bed number twelve , bed santi slept until day he disappeared , which same day bomb fell sky . carlos , predictably , begins see visions shadows , first , it isn't understood whether these come his mind or if they real . one night , shadow tempts him behind bed curtain , when carlos pulls curtain back , shadow gone . but pitchers water boys ' room fallen their stands break , when other children awaken , carlos jaime each take pitcher refill kitchen . carlos sees footprints spilled water . when boys reach kitchen , jaime pumps water his pitcher , waits outside carlos . carlos pumping , rack scissors kitchen falls makes loud noise . jacinto ( eduardo noriega , open your eyes ) , young caretaker who once orphan himself here , comes investigate . carlos flees down into cellar hide , there he encounters shadow taunted him . he touched his phantom cellar , we see , before anyone else , this image real . it boy , no older than carlos , upper left portion his forehead cracked open , pale , blood seeping upwards if body underwater . after touching carlos , ghost quickly disappears , but voice says , " many you die . " it prophecy demands fulfillmen t.t here gold orphanage , gold carmen casares give those called nationalists , support their cause . jacinto knows this gold , he wishes steal it himself . not only he bedding conchita , beautiful young cook ( jaime wide-eyed crush ) , but he also taking carmen bedmate . it unusual coupling ; carmen principal when jacinto orphan there , she wooden leg she must set aside accept him . ( some small irony there . ) when they partner , jacinto takes replaces one key her large ring keys see if it one open safe holds gold . jacinto , ghost may least their worries . this excellent film , one better appreciated second viewing . i've heard it compared others , but i doubt such comparisons would made if director writer others , alejandro amenabar , not also mexican . while they both ghost stories , they operate under completely different rules . i highly recommend this . 4� stars rounded up five convincing " paranormals " .	1
hbo documentary " you believe miracles ? story 1980 u.s. hockey team " came end mark johnson spoke how 20 players never together same room again after their visit white house , credits began roll up screen they played very moving song seemed wrap up show very happy note . anybody know name artist or song ? i think it may either crosby , stills nash or possibly neil young .	1
i , however , see different version than one listed here . one i saw 122 minutes mandarin subtitles came 2 discs . there some bad cuts some cheesy cgi scenes but overall movie stunning visually . i found story coherent believable fairy tale world presented . touching love story typical broken hearts lies boot . nothing earth shaking but enjoyable	1
yes , el dorado similar plot rio bravo , it stars " duke " directed same director . but , el dorado much tighter leaner script , doesn't contain any dreaded " filler " like rio bravo , nor it woefully miscast ricky nelson . ( it still superior western though)el dorado co-stars much more effective james caan , incomparable robert mitchum spectacular performance . great story , wonderful superb cast , lots great action masterful direction make this " must-see " western . ( " splinters hand " scene seen believed ! ) highly recommended	1

this third mtv fitness dvd i purchased far my favorite . power yoga really hard one my favorite fitness dvd i own . thing i like best this one breakdown upper lower body workouts . i haven't tried 10 minute full body workout but am glad i always option . i work out , weights , yoga 4-5 times week this really hard me first time around . i just finished my second workout today still couldn't finish all reps few exercises . pretty good shape , it hard find dvd challenging enough make me sore feel like i worked hard . if you're like me you love this dvd ! abs main focus throughout both workouts so prepared . since pilates all core makes sense , but my core really talking me after only 15 mns ! i opt upper lower sections back back so my next day just cardio . ready sore after very first time use it ! kristin really good instructor doesn't annoy me like so many others out there . only thing i say she super advanced so prepared look beginning or intermediate people dvd . i am totally pumped this dvd because she incorporates moves i've never seen before which refreshing . bikini season here i come !	1
this my first leslie sansone set , but it certainly won't my last ! this exercise series features walking place , accented different steps- side step , kick , knee lifts , etc . this particular set comes stretchie , long band rubber [ ? ] you use while walking work out your arms well your legs . leslie very motivational , she talks you through whole program , which something i enjoy but some other people may not . she group backing walkers who walk background behind her , they range vastly age- there 70-plus year old man walking , few women their 60s 50s well one her 20s . exercises fantastic- simple enough anyone them , very low-impact easy joints , they require very little space . only complaint i this set background music- it seems kind " off " me it gets boring after while [ it not really music , just keyboard beat some guy saying " walk , power walk " over over again ] . that small concession this fabulous exercise program , though . thanks leslie	1

you might interested this spanish/argentine film because inclusion gael garcia bernal ' motorcycle diaries ' other superb latino-american films . yes , he it , but what more impressive outstanding acting cecilia ross , star ' all my mother ' ( wife fito paez , director ' vidas privadas ' aka ' private lives ' ) . she gives strong acting heroine this very unconventional story . cecilia ross middle-aged carmen , visiting her ailing father buenos aires , argentina . carmen now living madrid , apart rest her family , but film story unfolds , we realize she often looks restless uneasy even though she back home . but carmen more peculiar habit . every night , alone dark room , she listens sounds young couple making love next room . she not eavesdropping or spying ; she doesn't even know their faces , she fact hires ' lovers ' ( including handsome model played gael garcia bernal ) . but why she ? melodramatic story follows fates carmen young model who both attacted each other through their voices , film not crave credibility , giving emphasis upon emotional turmoil unlikely couple , so if you say plot impossible , no one blame you . but those who laugh this apparently incredible chain events , or who wince intentionally ( i think ) exaggerated sound effects piano strings , would miss film point . previous reviewer says , understand film we need keep mind film nature akin greek tragedy , which we mortals all frail erring . behind these all-too-human characters you see ghost atrocious dictatorship argentina , which started late 70s . now it gone , good i hope , but it still torment those who involved , whether oppressors or oppressed . though film cast give unanimously good acting , it cecilia ross who most impressive , times literally dedicating herself character . fans gael garcia bernal would not disappointed , whose character plays crutial role latter half film . just wait while , you see his good performance . similar theme ( sad history argentina ) taken up ' imagining argentina ' starring emma thompson antonio banderas . i didn't think it good , but well , just case you're interested .	1
it nice see two lead characters movie flawed talk , act , react like normal people . even though movie clocks more than 2 hours , it didn't feel long . viewer i looked forward next scene not because i anticipating big revelation plot but because i so taken story i want know why they act way they . movie opens mary mcdonell , who played soap opera diva , hospital oblivious fact she surgery due car accident would make her unable walk . she assisted numerous nurses but all them quit because her not so pleasant attitude . then came alfre woodard , spunky nurse who problem her own . she only one who able handle mary mcdonnel . relationship two women , who living lives they never imagined living , heart soul movie . what i like movie it didn't resort melodrama order tell story full punch . ending not resort quick resolution where both ladies ' problems go away two leads suddenly become best friends . they would probably still face same problems they would still probably fight occasionally , but now they better perspective looking things more important , they now acknowledge how each affect help each other obvious ways not so obvious ways . it low key but beautiful ending movie ended two ladies boat facing each other sunset . grade :	1
if you don't watch this movie due negative reviews then you missing out something ... not something great but pretty good sequel . some people just following what others saying so they won't sound ' uncool ' saying they like it . let rewind minute or two back when this movie came out . i saw this theatres i tell you people jumped during those 3-d shots same way they during friday 13th part 3 3-d ! chewed off arm shark breaking glass , effects not bad all like most would you believe . movie itself , i thought it pretty good . you shark lagoon scary enough . but towards end when you see mother shark tale whip back forth break gate open due force shark strength your imagination let you aleady wonder how big this shark ! you also shark hunter this movie his partner try cage shark up begin . you big name stars like dennis quaid louis gossett jr. joining cast . yes you stereotype ' must ' every shark movie guy/girl relationship , shark hunter , weak character/brother , businessman , etc . there actually many things going this movie my opinion i go into negative things also like anyone else . but bottom line this movie not one , but two big sharks . it also some suspense it like parts 1 2 shark coming up it victim behind . idea big shark swimming around sea undergound see-though glass structure people walking just makes it much better . it not jaws . nothing even close first one . it not jaws 2 many would agree worthy sequel truth they could stopped right there would good set open/close . but if you look jaws 3 something other than sequel judge it it own .. heck , pretend it name like maybe shark attack 5 or something i am pretty sure you think this movie least better than most said jaws 3 . not classic but good saturday afternoon/night movie .	1
2nd this evangelical christian sci-fi thriller series even better than 1st ( i reviewed one , too , if you interested . ) . part its charm its b-movie budget , effects , sets , locations , acting . not read books i still entertained story kept my interest despite its holes , preachiness . acting mostly not-wellknown actors good excellent , made me care good guys , hiss bad . i'm looking forward round 3 . leave any religious bias behind , just sit back enjoy entertaining little film .	1
i first saw " good neighbors " ( 1975-77 ) late 1970s pbs , shortly after show completed . i impressed wit comic timing actors , subtle comedy which didn't hit you over head make point . when they came market vhs format , i decided buy them installments , am very happy i . you likely know story : richard briers plays tom good , frustrated 40 year old draftsman who works plastics company . good his wife barabara ( felicity kendall ) decide " get back basics " thereby tom quits his job , turns yard into huge garden , buys chickens pigs livestock decides become self sufficient , bartering only what they need , etc . not practical life style 1970s suburban london . contrasting their neighbors : jerry margo ledbetter , played paul eddington penelope keith . mr. ledbetter executive plastics company tom good used work ; he crawls grovels boss keep his high paying job , which supports his expensive well furnished home . ledbetter slave his work despite finanicial prosperity ; good doesn't answer boss or schedule , but faces obstacle after obstacle his crops or livestock . chemistry comic timing all 4 principal actors very fine , laughs many frequent . despite impractical plot - no one would get away livestock subdivision anywhere civilized world long - this makes wholesome entertainment . i haven't seen dvd version comparison , but vhs tapes very good quality : clear picture , great camera work .	1

prison martial art/fight movies never seemed work very well me . bloodfist 3 circuit 2 only decent ones i recall , but undisputed 2 far better probably one best made date . michael jai white , highly skilled athletic actor , finally gets lead role film . unfortunately , his character limited boxing champion - not martial arts expert , though white skilled area ( his fight scene universal soldier return against van damme awesome ) . he learn bit martial arts basics however , go up against his nemesis film - played incredible scott adkins . adkins ' character so cool , you almost want cheer him instead . his athelticism fabulous he performs moves his fight scenes incomparable any other martial arts fighters i seen film . he also gets nearly same screen time , equal amount dialouge white this film , allowing his charcater explored too . story typical movie prison scenerio - illegal fighting , russian prison etc etc some guy wants get rich who heads fights . script fact suffer some , but movie progressively gets more interesting . there even happy tender ending , alsmot weird film such profanity such , its kinda cheesy but hey , something nice change . its good see martial art/fight movies still made , there definte audience out there . undisputed 2 great above average film its genre , far better than first undisputed	1
last minute plo t-t wist mildly jejune quality hallmark b+ movie . but alas , there more , me movie not make b+ mark . twist also renders premises movie both highly improbable sufficiently illogical seriously undermine verisimilitude which thereto carefully constructed suspense rests . movie could nearly emotionally compelling -- if understandably less epic narratively than -- " godfather " . fact it sort 90% viewing . then close very end it becomes sort flawed parlor game mind . suspended disbelief comes crashing down . i don't think i ever left movie theater feeling so let down	-1

i recall , this movie originally shunned upon it theatrical release 1990 . it ambitious sequel one milestone films 70 went through troubled production studio turnaround through years . yet star/ director jack nicholson slips comfortably back into jj gittes territory creates damned fine film much mindbending twists featured chinatown . though maybe not amazing film , two jakes still worthwhile its own right features terrific cast : harvey keitel , madeliene stowe , late , great richard farnsworth . usual , paramount given us anemic strange dvd ( thatrical trailer included , letterboxed 2.35 : 1 even though film itself 1.85 : 1 ??? ) due film poor box-office showing it probably never see better release , even though it deserves one	1

i love these types movies , b/c all reviews this page very thoughtful interesting . i agree most everything , but one thing keeps popping up i disagree idea characters totally unlikable . i personally find characters extremely sympathetic . these people all incredible pain . they miserable . not one single character happy . they all trying medicate their pain , oblivious fact love they all seeking within arms reach , yet they step each other " get theirs " such extent end no one happy . yes , may incredibly bad mother , but she shell person her entire life , practically no joy whatsoever . ditto others . how world these not sympathetic characters ? i lot love my life . course i sympathize those who none .	1

i am curious whether or not any my fellow reviewers ever actually played game ? this movie not made stand its own , it made supplement universe . characters mialee , lidda , redgar iconic characters who known gamers several years . story not really meant tell background characters or how they got together , rather it designed tell part their story , one many adventures group together . personally , i liked movie . yes there only 4 endings but , what you want them ? this first choose your own adventure dvd , fact first choose you own adventure dvd i seen . i watched story 6 different times each time garnering new information yet get forth ending . if one so inclined they could go through movie dozen times still probably not see every scene combination available . people who buy it dissapointed because its poor game , news flash ... its not game . it dvd choose your own adveture story based game . i liked able watch movie recognize mialee casting fireball , or group fighting earth elemental summoned druid . yes it very basic concept game but , thats all it meant . first time shot dark see how people react such concept . anyways i highly reccomend this movie anyone who plays or similar fantasy rpg . just keep it mind this isn't best fantasy story out there but its definatly good start choose your own adventure genre . calsu	1
this movie little known treasure . i remember watching it several times growing up , but nobody else i know ever seen it . real men very difficult find , it never released dvd format until know . i strongly suggest you buy this movie ( especially this price ! ) . it high replay value ( almost like blues brothers ) it keep you entertained years come	1
first all , if you're going see this movie , remember not take it too seriously . it touch some serious subjects , course meant make you think , but above all , it comedy . it silly raunchy fun . don't read too much into i t.t hat said ... this movie great ! if you're fan sarandon , cher , pfiefer , or nicholson , you'll probably like it . if you're fan all 4 , you'll love it . there aren't any oscar-calibur performances here , but you tell actors just lot fun their characters ( which i always find entertaining ) . susan sarandon most fun me , she goes super-dowdy free-spirited sexual . you've got love jack nicholson suave evil only nicholson . plus , cher huge infomercial hair ! combine all kinds weird religious messages , you've got yourself movie	1
i expected hystrionic-filled movie , pleasantly surprised wisecracker oscar levant . he makes film . course , whenever you buy one these joan crawford works , you're going get her flashing , emotive persona , but stiletto-sharp writing beautiful score keep you cringing . it treat front row one several oscar levant / james garfield ( really isaac stern ) piano/violin duets . this film worth investment . you want revisit musical performances .	1
second five pink panther features ( i don't count 1982 trail pink panther since it mainly deleted scenes outtakes cobbled together previous films ) , shot dark ( 1964 ) first actually star peter sellers ( what new , pussycat , party , murder death ) his signature role ever bumbling inspector jacques clouseau ( original pink panther film featured david niven well cat burglar , while seller role clouseau more supporting one ) . produced , directed , co-written blake edwards ( " peter gunn " , party , revenge pink panther ) , other co-writer william peter blatty ( exorcist ) , film includes elke sommer ( baron blood ) , herbert lom ( spartacus ) , george sanders ( village damned ) , tracy reed ( casino royale ) , graham stark ( return pink panther ) , burt kwouk ( you only live twice ) . film begins we see various figures furtively sneaking large , french chateau , punctuated some gunshot ringing out night . we soon learn passionate spaniard chauffeur murdered , housekeeper named maria gambrelli ( sommer ) prime suspect , due fact she found room body , holding smoking gun her hand . it turns out murder occurred estate wealthy businessman named benjamin ballon ( sanders ) inspector jacques clouseau ( sellers ) , mistakenly assigned case , soon makes scene , his assistant hercule ( stark ) ... i say mistakenly given prominence those involved , chief inspector dreyfus ( lom ) , who despises clouseau passion due his bumbling antics , would never knowingly allowed clouseau investigate such delicate case . anyway , clouseau quickly removed investigation but soon re-instated interested parties , reasons unknown , pull few strings his behalf . clouseau blunders his way forward , he convince maria didn't commit murder , she covering someone else , but one wonders if clouseau belief stems fact he quickly falling accused . things go seriously awry clouseau tries various methods determine identity killer , which really only results two thing , first increasing body count various members ballon household suffer deaths unnatural causes , second drive chief inspector dreyfus further further brink insanity . not only , but mysterious assassin loose , intent killing clouseau himself ! things eventually come head once clouseau gathers all interested parties one room , intent expose killer who he surely believes among group . many would say shot dark best among pink panther films , i'd hard pressed argue , but i've always partial pink panther strikes again ( 1976 ) , one where dreyfus , after escaping asylum , threatens destroy world unless effort coerce nations world send their best assassins eliminate clouseau once all . while shot dark may not screwball some later pink panther films , it still extremely funny , entertaining worth most anyone time given strength writing wonderful performances . sellers , well sellers , bumbling , awkward , nincompoop detective who , somehow always manages come out top ( but not without few bumps bruises way ) . it difficult picturing anyone else role after seeing sellers ' performances , but we given opportunity so 2006 release starring steve martin . i yet see new film , but i really no desire so i don't think it live up originals . sellers perfected role , i little interest seeing someone else trying top something i doubt could topped . anyway , sellers helped way great performances herbert lom , clouseau beleaguered supervisor graham stark clouseau unfortunate assistant . throw lot humorous dialogue , goofy situations galore , henry mancini memorable scoring you've got one heck comedic adventure . some my more favored parts film include running gags , particularly one where clouseau dons any number disguises , all which end up him arrested various misdemeanors ( one scene he disguised street vendor selling balloons order follow maria unnoticed , but he quickly arrested he doesn't possess street vendor license ) . great sequence occurs when clouseau tries follows maria surreptitiously into nudist colony , he can't gain entrance until he strips down himself . i've never seen so many carefully place set pieces obscure all naughty bits inappropriate pg rated film . then there various bits clouseau manservant kato ( later films he known cato ) , played burt kwouk , who instructed his employer attack clouseau when he least expects it , if only continually improve his employers ability deal unexpected . finally there finale , clouseau gathers those remaining one room , gets whole lot more than he bargained once revelations begin coming furious pace . all all this terrific murder/mystery comedy , one worth watching more than once . picture , presented both widescreen anamorphic ( 2.35 : 1 ) fullscreen ( 1.33 : 1 ) , looks very clean , dolby digital mono audio , available both english french , comes through clearly . far extras , there eight page booklet , original theatrical trailer , subtitles english french . there also hidden feature , one found clicking title main menu , revealing vintage promotional ad . cookieman108by way , if you don't happen own any pink panther films dvd but interested buying them , look pink panther film collection dvd set which includes pink panther ( 1963 ) , shot dark ( 1964 ) , pink panther strikes again ( 1976 ) , revenge pink panther ( 1978 ) , trail pink panther ( 1982 ) . only one not included within set return pink panther ( 1975 ) , only because mgm somehow lost rights film universal pictures , who release movie onto dvd 2006 ( thankfully ) .	1

film restoration work looks sounds magnificent . eddie kramer gets extra congratulations 5.1 audio mix . said , 3rd disc mainly stereo only . karen review below bit harsh . if you actually listen main film commentary , you understand why more footage isn't available : not every second 3 days performances captured . concert films not exist genre this time ( see annoyingly choppy ' festival!' documenting newport ) , so this new territory point film make document gave overall feel event time . pennebaker his crew decide which songs film , which seems predetermined dylan buddy bob neuwirth who more familiar scene than filmmaker . they would turn red light stage signal start filming next song . some times , they didn't plan camera men would shoot their discretion , so some performances may captured only 1 camera therefore considered not presentable . also , film reels would end during performances need changed ( approx every 20 minutes ) , hence footage missing two jimi songs . regarding lack more outtake footage : 1 . your precious janis big brother new manager albert grossman didn't allow them filmed first day , but finally they asked play again next day because crowd reaction desire get something film . whole set could exist but i doubt it . grossman his need control probably blame , it no coincidence woodstock filmmakers also refused use her footage original release . she only appears now directors cut . 2 . byrds set extremely historic , one should included whole if it exists . 3 . who set only missing ' pictures lily ' not counting ' my generation ' which proper film . it bootleg who dvd so why wasn't included inexplicable . i would like seen all footage each artist set put together bonus disc including songs included whole or part actual final film , so it all one place . what we get anything besides what made final cut . 4 . far tiny tim , yes his impromptu performances annoying , but they part just , impromptu candid backstage footage supplied bonus , not part 2 hours bonus footage . so , skip past it like i get over it . 5 . regarding grateful dead , small glimpse seen beginning ' jimi plays monterey ' film , but liner notes 4cd box set 1992 tells us , like janis , band or management refused allow any audio or visuals used . i assume they didn't like their performance , or wanted control it like rest their own vault . whole festival charity , we also learn supplementary interviews , artists therefore sign waivers releasing rights their performances . my guess it dead refused comply . 6 . real shame there no footage lou rawls ' electrifying set , which would also show more diversity genre festival . 7 . charles shaar murray commentary during hendrix film actually quite insightful entertaining . yes , there some funny comments substances clothing . he wrote definitive biography jimi , his commentary well founded gives context why his perfomance festival revolutionary . said , this definitive package , must own release serious rock collector library	1

original version cape fear thrilling its presentation any modern thriller or suspense . it dark mood it , creepiness , requires sense restlessness part audience : all important facets suspense . dark mood film personified within first ten minutes film , we see malicious ex-con max cody ( played robert mitchum ) lurk background court then finally confront man who he seeks revenge , lawyer sam bowden ( gregory peck ) . bowden doesn't immediately recognize cody , this only seems engage his sinister nature even more . bowden , this point , must all he protect not only himself , but his family against this man . perhaps what makes this film work simply mitchum performance max cody . there despicable nature cody , hard-edge persona there viewer see , but there still something else his mannerisms really get under your skin . unlike some outright villains , he not so much open book manipulative temperament . instead raging raising his voice injustices , he smirk his face calm manner while planning plotting , this makes him even more mysterious malevolent . he quintessential bad guy , probably ranks among most despicable characters film history simply because his relentlessness perversion . without giving too much away , if there one blemish , it would seemingly rushed ending film . it somewhat satisfying , but it seemed though there would more tell end . this , however , not take away performances , over all affect film . great movie watch if you want see top-notch thriller ! 4 1/2 stars	1

years ago i saw nicholas cage `8 mm , ' which pretty bad film , leaving some nasty taste my mouth . then someone still remembered this forgettable film , decided re-use title again lure unsuspecting viewers like me . fact , `8mm 2'was originally called `the velvet side hell ' forgettable film absolutely nothing nick cage thriller . apparently film categorized thriller or mystery , but greatest mystery how this kind dishonesty allowed all . film director refers film " sexual thriller . " surely it sexual , but never thrilling . right beginning includes one incredible laughable sexual fantasy courtroom , david , aspiring ( boring ) politician played johnathon schaech so many ridiculous things it impossible believe he could fianc� tish , daughter american ambassador budapest . these lovers stupidly seduced night budapest when one glamorous lady named rita shows up before them . cue obligatory `threesome ' scene . they blackmailed . they search rita who just disappeared . they go further into underworld porno industry city . they deep trouble . we going see just predictable ending not clever filmmakers seem think . [ tedious , so tedious ] actually , earliest stage `8mm 2 , ' tedium settles , so you cannot enjoy film even `so-bad-so-good ' film . film tries stretch poor story more than 100 minutes , which told most thrill-free , by-the-number way , without giving couple any real dangers . film also attempts show psychological changes happening characters , tish particular , but unfortunately poor acting leading lady cannot convince us she fatally attracted world forbidden her . one scene two ladies dancing together clearly inspired `basic instinct , ' but there no sharon stone her fearless audacious performance , which not afraid campy . johnathon schaech director . . cardone worked together `the forsaken ' `mummy ' armadillo . ' probably `8mm 2 ' worse than these , much worse than nicholas cage original . only thing i thought good it beautiful buildings budapest . but many scenes shot night , even this fun denied us .	-1

this truly one most spectacular films ever made , not suffering made during silent era . however , correctly stated review film , dvd version runs 139mins oppossed vhs 155mins . this not due dvd faster frame rate , but rather because dvd version huge portion film cut no obvious reason . one point , hero ( fairbanks ) fulfilled prophecy princess first touch rose-tree , next minute he seen explaining her ( intimate scene ) he not what he seems . seen vhs number times , i confirm dvd version brutally cut . not buy dvd version , it let-down those scenes missing ; thus reason my one star , which would otherwise 4 1/5 ( 5 stars rimsky korsakov soundtrack ) . you warned	-1
" five hundred dollars !

ok , so i bought this dvd because one my all time favorite actors it ( i'm huge jimmy stewart fan too ! ) . while this movie good back drop cary grant , plot bit bland ... spoiled rich man must make his own living year win bet . some meetings his quot ; moniedquot ; crowd , while he working stiff , entertaing , but not really memorable . maybe i'm used his later movies where he really shined , but this movie just didn't grab me . or maybe it quality dvd . i might gotten more out it if i turned sound off , sound track bad . there few skips usual quot ; old filmquot ; wrinkles visual , but they wouldn't so hard deal if i didn't keep adjusting sound .... even then , some dialogue still sounded like gibberish . could i've just got really bad bootleg copy . i advise against purchasing dvd whose cover case shows cg shoulders up front car stone house .	-1

i found this documentary insult my intelligence . here facts : 1 . ) pete best not very good drummer . simple . all you use your ears . all one listen tony sheridan recordings , decca audition tapes , early bbc performances beatles , emi session pete best hear clearly he best competent unexceptional . i mean , that hour music which judge this guy . ringo contrast distinctive touch energy drums immediately brought musical quality beatles much higher realm ( which good drummer usually rock'n'roll , it " beat " oriented music . who without keith moon , or zeppelin without bonham just isn't same . go listen hour earliest recordings beatles ringo it no-contest . sorry pete ! 2 . ) what really offensive this cash-in documentary worst kind-is recording ( pete best band ) beatle sound-alike music soundtrack . when i mean beatle soundalike music , i mean mccartney bass lines ala revolver era , high up neck-jangly guitar or day tripper .... basically beatles music pete best absolutely nothing , subtle implication ( after hearing how much pete best contributed beatles " sound " ) pete might responsible such progression innovation . obviously nothing could further truth . why not record versions early rock'n'roll songs , material pete actually played beatles ? i mean , why am i hearing folk-rock jangle over black white footage depressed liverpool early 60 ? 3 . ) best , not first time , reveals himself one most humourless , dim liverpudlians i've ever seen-and that after seen countless documentaries beatles liverpool scene . less beatle-y personality you'd hard put locate . this just revisionist documentary guy who always sour grapes ( understandably so ) . guy written his autobiography three times . there no mystery why pete best ( correctly ) kicked out beatles . he wasn't one them . , despite revisionist testimony this documentary ( what else these guys going say pete ? they still see him liverpool , work beatlefan convention circuit him ! ) , he just really medicore musical talent . not worse , but nothing original , nothing contributory . he laid down passable beat , he incapbable " interplay " , least based musical evidence available . not so ringo ! go take out your copy beatles version " long tall sally " tell me pete best capable . or beatles version " i'm gonna sit right down cry over you " , either star club or bbc radio recordings . no way . sorry . not million years . very first recording beatles ringo ( " some other guy " cavern club ) , ringo drives band authority , sets down solid groove , contributes interesting , often melodic drumming ideas still influential this day . pete never set down such heavy groove , least not abundant recorded evidence . screw him ! don't waste your money this documentary unless you're completest . trust me this .	-1

i would put this classic midnight movie .... movie potential funnier than it but wound up far more disjointed than it should ... it seemed like they trying " hard days night " type film . obstacle they faced johnny rotten wanted nothing this film , only seen concert footage interviews . us tour footage great watch , they really should released dallas san fran footage its entirety here . way , it this film made sid vicious tragic hero turned him into even more cartoon parody himself , but " my way " scene classic . animation funny , silly , memorable . it also fills some blanks , like lydon stabbing record company incident where they out control . would made great adult cartoon they chose take it all way . film worth it pistols footage , but whole ronnie biggs thing pretty much pointless . steve jones malcolm mclaren provided barebones " continudity " throughout film . glen matlock also seen but nothing much more . film essential pistols fans well fans punk rock , although definitely not anyone under 16 . if you're looking documentary pistols , this not film . julien temple " filth fury " pistols documentary bar none puts more depth into vicious well lydon involved , classic albums series " nmtb " , ramones " end century " well . johnny rotten would try his hand acting film called " corrupt " harvey keitel (!) , film went nowhere . don letts ( who there beginning ... dj well big audio dynamite member ) made 2 great films , " punk rock movie " which came out middle punk movement more recent " punk : attitude " which i'd recommend because he talked people who helped shape , influence execute it . here list other recommended films : sid nancy , slc punk , repo man , urgh ! music war , decline western civilization , doa , clash - westway world , fabulous stains , state mind , suburbia , reform school girls , rock roll high school , rude boy , vh1s 25 years punk worth tracking down well .

i remember seeing this movie when i preteen , even back then i witnessed acts violence within my school . mark lester visionary , but brilliant class 1984 foresaw somewhat epidemic events regarding school violence well spawning few imitators . ( i.e. substitute , principal , 187 , class nuke em high , suburbia .. etc . ) best way describe co 1984 would based movie influences ; clockwork orange meets blackboard jungle .. but more grittier . tim van patten deserves praise props his convincing portrayal peter stegman ; psychotic gang leader who his cronies behind drugpushing , gangbanging ( more ways than one , if you get first last 20 minutes film . ) sabotage other capers outside lincon high school . there quite few disturbing moments within film ( spoiler alert)such when black drug dealer cornered stegman gang which stegman utters ; " we're only n*****s here sell drugs .. " this same actor who starred predominetly black cast . ( white shadow)now that acting . mutilation corrigan animals .. peta damned , corrigan ( brilliantly played late great roddy mcdowel planet apes fright night . ) holding class hostage , gang rape scene involving andy norris ' pregnant wife jusfitied rage norris ( mandingo perry king)in which he burns , beats bonesaw sinister gang memebers . very end bit hard swallow ( unless you suspend your disbelief . ) but very satisfactory . m.j. fox role really nothing me i feel king especially van patten parts should've propelled them major stardom . ( guy even wrote personally performed poingant piano scene . ) there no justice i tell ya . my major disapointment dvd , tim rest cast wasn't included blood blackboards retrospective . lester commentary bit dull but it better than bare bones disc . there actually unrated version dts sound over uk . i doubt if anchor bay release it here states , but it better than nuttin'great movie help put punk scene cinematic mapand cool theme song performed shock rocker alice cooper . great 80 classic alongside escape ny , terminator , aliens , road warrior etc . thanks anchor bay !	1
" welcome paradise . name dante ! " so begins sandra bullock jason patric harrowing adventure seaborne legend . beautiful ship , friendly passengers , attentive crew would ordinarily make splendid cruise . unfortunately , among passengers madman who bent ruining everyone vacation . though it would appear this film not universally well-loved , it actually one my favorite action moves . i enjoyed main setting : cruise ship . passengers very funny . among them couple who selling new diet regimen called fat busters , where " fat your friend " ( so body won't try hoard fat , making weight loss difficult ) . their fellow shipmates , surrounded cruise ship banquet-like meal , heartily agree . deaf girl who signs wonderful . villain entertaining . ( admittedly , story behind his motivation destroy ship may rather contrived . ) action moves ocean-liner , speedboat , personal water-craft , propeller aircraft , then finally tower high atop oil tanker . ( if you've ever wondered what it would look like see oil tanker blow up , your curiosity satisfied what happens next . ) all , this movie little like trip amusement park . there lots action this movie , no small amount comedy	1

decades movie going collecting , there only few films keep coming mind unexpected moments . me , this what great art ; , it becomes part one experience not just momentary diversion . sacrifice great film . it touches most fundamental questions human our post-modern world . it it extraordinary grace sublime , haunting , beauty . miss point this film , some reviewers , or call it sophomoric , others , admit one own inability consider life itself may hold greater meaning we more than accidental fluke cold , uncaring universe . this film dares use its considerable art challenge us like zen koan prayer . it meditation what it means fully human mortal moral . it asks us wonder unknown it weeps we prisoners our humanity -- we hold fate our planet our hands . all this sounds kind pretentious , i know , but this magnificent yet simple film works higher level than most movies . it not easily categorized . but big screen , i hypnotized extraordinary cinematography equally transported subtle ideas . it transcendent movie going experience i didn't expect one remained vivid years pass	1

" my whole life ordinary then we met these amazing things started happen . " ~ amanda it love makes amanda better cook makes her cooking taste even better tom ? their senses state heightened awareness chemicals rushing through their bodies or there magic floating ? once she finds recipe caramel eclairs , tom even more attracted her . there very few movies cooking or chefs so this one treat . tear drops food reminded me like water chocolate . emotions amanda feels somehow magically mixed into food she cooking . either dishes make people cry , stun them or make them lose their inhibitions . she seems magical gift culinary creations effect anyone who consumes them . after watching this movie you may want feed your lover oranges , invest some expensive vanilla extract , get lost kiss or cook up some bliss . if you looking best vanilla your cooking , bourbon-madagascar vanilla superior . deliciously cute , silly spells , sweet innocent love few hot steamy kissing scenes kitchen . romantics lovers kitchens cuisine . almost culinary cinderella story . you might enjoy these books : seduction cookbook diane brown ( baked salmon raspberry cabernet sauce , ideas late night seduction snacks information growing erotic herb garden . ) passionfruit cookbook patrick jesse pons-worley ( flavor passion fruit so seductive exotic . ) written spoon ( poetry recipes ) illustrated encyclopedia orchids alec pridgeon edible flower garden rosalind creasy intercourses : aphrodisiac cookbook ( " fig pastries " decadent naughty . ) movies food themes : babette feast like water chocolate scent green papaya my big fat greek wedding big night ~ rebecca review p.s. if you need recipe caramel iced eclairs entice someone , e-mail me my site . i can't believe they didn't publish cookbook go this movie , they still should !	1

if you expecting straight adaptation novel ' naked lunch ' you've come wrong place .. if you looking two styles converging into twisted bizarre sci-fi arthouse extravaganza - step right up .. david cronenberg ( fly , scanners , existenz , etc . ) unique attatchment surreal sci-fi investigations nature reality transformation ( i think i am miserably failing describe his cinema ) - burroughs also style which , shall we say , twists bounds reality -sometimes literally his drug induced descriptions ' naked lunch ' .. but mostly his radical prose style ( something james joyce aldous huxley but extra ingredient bizzare ) .. somehow this meeting two artists works out creates this frightening alternate noir-like alter-universe called interzone .. highlights movie include cronenberg strange puppetry which bring life burroughs creatures his own unconcious mind .. this beautiful movie look - one plays like fever-dream .. my only dissapointment i just read book - still so awe burroughs writing - i trouble excepting interpretation .. but cronenberg artistry actually enhances more than it detracts .	1
set bronx 1963 , wanderers focuses life several young gang members coming age . it surface wanderers may seem like nothing more than sytlish little ditty . but watch closely you'll find this movie existential masterpiece . ken wahl plays richie , handsome charismatic leader wanderers gang . ken juggles his friendships , loyalties , girlfriends , struggles maintain his italian gang position neighborhood . wanderers face threats wongs ( chinese gang ) , baldies ( greaser gang ) , irish gang black gang . but while all these gangs fight eachother , they fail recognize real threats their ethnic enclave end decade existential angst . always edge this movie threat duckie boys gang . movie never identifies ethnic identity duckie boys . instead viewer experiences them silent secret hoard white men emerging fog calm , placid psychotic smiles their faces . duckie boys seem number hundreds-a creepy mass nameless individuals . pivitol scene , wanderers blacks gathered football field throwdown-they see enemy eachother . but edge field ducky boys quietly gather , waiting strike . black , italian chinese band together fight this hoard angry psychotic white men which seem represent urban america-the america threatens swallow them all , force them assimilate leave behind their ethnic identities . threat end era cleverly disguised nina ( karen allen ) , hip beautiful hippie chick . richie enthralled her , but bound his italian girlfriend . he feels nina pull climatic scene they end up back richie car then discovered . ultimately richie returns his girlfriend forced marry her . but nina never really leaves his mind . we see richie his bachelor party he glimpses nina street . he follows her club where bob dylan ( real bob dylan according movie credits ) playing " times they changing " . richie doesn't go talk her , returns bachelor party swallowed up italians . indications he going " made man " , married daughter mafioso but their way life ending . 1970 approaching . nina no doubt go hip east villager richie settle into role he forced play life circumstances , never entering modern society . we left feeling like richie generation last it kind . this movie achieves violence without violent . viewers taste threat never quite know where it coming . characters acting this movie superb . plot subtle unique . it isn't your modern gang movie where drugs guns violence fireworks otherwise extremely dull movie	1

i've always liked this film even though it often dismissed critics because marketing " sensurround " sound film contained made you really feel quakes . most critics thought this hollow film focused gimmick . i disagree strongly . sound other special effects actually very groundbreaking , no pun intended , enhanced one experience film greatly . it huge hit when it came out . fact , even dvd you enjoy this special sound device simply upping bass and/or sub woofer your stereo . i 50 inch plasma television 5.1 dolby sound home theatre system i able recapture much theatre experience i when i first saw film 1974 . it freaked out my kids whom i didn't warn advance what i doing . they loved it . addition , other special effects top-notch still hold up even today . acting well-done all-star cast familar faces although script faulty times , it works well enough . one aspect i really appreciate this film it wasn't afraid kill off major characters we've grown like very much way " deep impact " . makes this disaster flick rather different than most genre . i highly recommend this film . even though this film great sound special effects , there no special features this dvd big disappointment . spite serious oversight , it worth owning you view this film many times . funny note : this film double-billed " towering inferno " once they called both films " shake bake " -- ya gotta appreciate humor	1
this ultimate collection any inxs fan . i love them much now , i eighties . some videos i never seen before , so makes it all better . video kiss dirt stands out me , because it filmed australian outback . what you need listen like thieves also unique videos . before they show each video , one members inxs tells you it , which i thought neat . there also live performances here which great . if you like inxs all , then you should definitely buy this	1

i thoroughly enjoyed " letters iwo jima " , standpoint well-crafted movie excellent acting performances casting , brilliantly subdued cinematography , haunting musical score . all respects , this thoughtful engrossing movie , imbued ever-present melancholy soldiers committed island battle they knew would their last . my only dissatisfaction " letters " , student military history wwii particular , decision downplay legendary ferocity 6 week conflict favor " behind-the-scenes " portrayals japanese soldier inner conflicts longings better times . i appreciate eastwood attempt remind us all human beings share similar longings home , family , peace- especially during surreal happenings war ..... but one should also remember much movie direction came letters written japanese soldiers iwo jima during conflict , unearthed many years later . all soldier letters , beginning time , reveal common threads humanity americans , japanese , germans , whatever .... but they also rarely dwell brutal harrowing realities conflict hand . all histories iwo jima i read , including many eye-witness accounts struggle , replete images ferocity struggle , tenacity japanese defenders , well unbelievable acts individual heroism both sides . 20,000 japanese sent iwo defend it last- somewhere neighborhood 1,000 or less survived . most rest died fighting . my only complaint " letters " it gave little sense struggle itself . it portrays defense mount suribachi almost walk park marines- though eye witness accounts rather different- top mountain fairly secure time marines reached summit famous flag raising(s ) , but several days before ones round-the-clock desperate fighting base mountain . many marine accounts recall those several days worst fighting they experienced whole pacific theatre . movie gives almost no sense . likewise , after suribachi fell , struggle went almost 6 more weeks , filled desperate cave-by-cave fighting , japanese resisting end . yes , there many ritual suicides documented marines(especially caves suribachi ) , but rest island two-way death struggle ultimately took 7,000 american lives . " letters " dwells bit too much " quiet moments " underground- my impression reading histories those moments precious few . movie honor humanity individual japanese soldier , but i think it also sells japanese soldier tenacity bravery quite short . letters recovered tell story , but only small part . letters never written tell story too . most 20,000 japanese soldiers iwo too busy write	1

6th day sheds light ( it should ) reality subsequently threat cloning . helicopter pilot not-so-distant future finds himself run powerful clone-producing corporation . arnold schwarzenegger rest cast truly outdone themselves their performances , which outstanding say least ! all actors , without exceptions , give it their 100% it really shows ( chemistry amazing) ! very well written very well presented , movie without doubt guaranteed provide more than just few thrills . setting , plot , dialogues , music all wonderful ! similarly movies like outbreak , day after tomorrow , island , lord war , blood diamond name few , 6th day draws attention some pretty important issues facing humanity . short , 6th day movie definitely worth watching one seriously consider adding your movie collection !	1
i very impressed objective treatment illegal immigrant situation arizona border . southern arizona resident , i've seen both sides issue first hand . if you concerned border , you likely find this movie informative . it portrays both sides , pro con stricter enforcement vs . amnesty . most importantly , it portrays human element . everyone border affected debate . debate if you , humans ( families , children , business owners ) environment ( range land , recreation areas ) affected . long time residents border towns fearful because limited support they security damage property litter constant people trafficing causes . many individuals groups concerned health safety those crossing into us . either way , safety , health problems , course , money all issues presented forefront this film . cries border portrays these concerns sympathy ( objectively ) both sides . i recommend this movie anyone who wishes present informed debate critical issues border security . it informs realistically gives insight into how critical this issue all us .	1

titanic compelling film real life story h.m.s. titanic . story detailed moving provides titanic lovers perspective agony suffering passengers this great ship endured during its last moments . those interested maritime safety or just interested knowing story behind titanic tragedy , this highly recommended movie . those not familiar history this great liner , brief narration may help . titanic launched belfast may 1911 . magazine time described it " practically unsinkable " . liner impressive its size features . she 269 metres long , 28 metres wide tall eleven storey building . luxury ship unique unparalleled time . among luxury features swimming pool first class passengers , first built liner . titanic set sail southampton 10 april 1912 . 14 april 1912 , look out man sounded alarm bells announced iceberg just ahead them . unfortunately , it too late ship collided iceberg within some few seconds , starboard side liner torn open seawater poured . sadly , there not enough lifeboats board only small fraction passengers ( largely those travelling first class ) rescued almost all those third class not rescued . ship band continued play during commotion followed stern ship rose high ship began sink . over 1500 people perished this accident . among critical lessons we learn this tragedy need effective safety management system . thankfully , many lessons learnt tragedy helped regulatory authorities , manufacturers ship owners come up design operational features made liners much safer .	1

i just couldn't believe how advanced these time they filmed . sure , you see strings holding up captain marvel while he flys , you even tell it dummy flying across screen . but it extremely well . story good starts expidition valley tombs where group people ( archeologists ? ) find hidden chamber tomb . hidden chamber one most powerful tools known man . golden scorpion , some lenses held it , it turn any regular object gold , or destroy any living thing existence . when they realize potential evil this item could , men divvy out lenses scorpion each other decide each hide his piece somewhere . same time , billy met old man who tells him he imbued power become captain marvel . however he told not abuse his powers , only use them stop scorpion . serial continues omnious scorpion brought life trying get all hidden pieces golden scorpion so he rule world ! thing i like this , previously stated , it 1941 , but doesn't adhere normal " super hero rules " . people die hands captain marvel ... but they deserved it ! saying , there course no really violent imagery . simply captain marvel doing stuff like throwing guys off top building or whatever . but you get idea . still good enough kids , i hardly wait show this my son when i get home	1
i rented this thinking it " place sun " ( also shelley winters)and so it took me bit not keep trying work story line into this one ( when he going push shelley off boat , i kept wondering ? ) :) anyway , once i adjusted fact this movie abused , lonely blind girl befriended black man , i found myself entranced lovely tale friendship forms under mutual adversity . gordon ( sidney poitier)helps blind selina move towards life independence freedom her mean , domineering mother ( winters ); selina offers gordon love friendship biased , racist world . takes no cheap shots offers no simplistic answers even better becaus . touching disturbing both . well worth locating watching	1
*** this comment may contain spoilers *** " manhunter " ( 1986 ) directed michael mann - masterpiece , pure simple . it took me five times but i finally realized it . i see it best adaptation favorite book written subject serial killers investigation their crimes . i also discovered william blake his fascinating art , including painting which gave book its title , " red dragon " , thanks mr. harris . michael mann certainly read book " red dragon " before he started work movie he able get inside it well book main character , graham able get inside murderer mind . scene where graham ( william peterson ) finds out who killer makes me shiver every time i watch movie . i not recall " moment truth " powerful convincing this one . it more powerful similar scene " sound lambs " where clarise starling figures out who where " buffalo bill " . michael mann took his time understanding how important scene it received royal treatment movie . i used disappointed mann cut book very impressive ending but after many viewings i think i understand why he it . me , whole movie build up " moment truth " scene after graham figured who murderer making us participants process , it not really matter ( least me ) how they going catch francis " red dragon " dolarhyde .	1
true most shows , first season ds9 ( seen hindsight ) actors groping bit their ultimate personality style seen later seasons . some interactions ( odo quark example ) seem bit over top compared nuances seen later seasons . still , there fair amount backstory covered this season makes later seasons more enjoyable watch . my opinion , ds9 first star trek franchise work more story arc than individual episodes could watched any order . quality dvd transfer not good later seasons ; likely they didn't preserve source material like today shows . softness/dirtiness picture what vhs tape would look like . not terrible , but not measuring up today dvd standards either	1

you say headache ? video editing switches multiple camera angles rate 1 camera every 2 seconds . you never get see anyone band " jam " out . i think editor wanted avoid boring just showing stage one camera , but result opposite extreme . it pretty much ruined perfect dvd me . band stellar audio incredible . i think it better turn tube off just crank speakers . or just buy cd . compare this death - live la you see what i mean	-1

poetic , beautiful hypnotic . series short vignettes lushly evoke some kurosawa dreams/visions . must anyone interested history classic films , and/or visual art . i use portions art appreciation class , context artists creating work out inner experiences or subconscious . it well received	1
while this movie wasn't deep-arguably is-it creative , unique , quite realistic . if you pay close attention dialogue it predictable especially if you like figure things out before they happen . willard carroll left just enough room make you wonder then certain revelations-unless you're out it-are expected not surprising . characters believable acting entire cast nothing short sensational . if you get confused easily , stick it out , comes together very nicely end . side note-two things : 1 . how excellent gillian anderson ability show range . don't get me wrong , love dana scully , i , however , she unsung hero when it comes this art . ( see her masterpiece theater bleak house . ) 2 . it my opinion most comedians stick comedy there but few when they transition or give drama try excellent job . said hats off jon stewart . his performance more than respectable .	1
not only this great show my daughter , but i loved it too . i remember it when i child .	1
ok , so this isn't best sci-fi movie ever but it really fun , if you get into it . this adventure looks like cross " road warrior " " alien " it tells story bounty hunter wolfe(peter strauss , tring hard but just not han solo ) landing planet ravaged plage rescue three ladies who crashed there held hostage strangest villian ever overdog(michael ironside(looking like borg grade ham) ! young molly ringwald hand ernie hudson help strauss get girls back . slow places some really strange encounters planets other citizens make it mixed bag , but i said if you get into spirit fun you may find you like this one also ! give it try !	1
i agree reviewer who mentioned unfinished subplots unexplained sequences . i gave this movie chance because i am huge john candy fan never heard it , but , i know often , sleeper movies buried gems just waiting found ( la benny joon)but this wasnt one them im afraid . i found this movie mildly amusing , john candy very well but overall , movie doesnt hold up his other movies . ending dissapointing there too many , above mentioned , unfinished subplots . there supposed some sort development john larroquette sequence ? really pointless addition other than give family somewhere go while candy learned his sailing yeah , what wrong popcorn ? i loved you john candy i miss you dearly , you'll always place my heart , however , this movie probably never watched again . i see you again , planes , trains automobiles .	-1
i first heard lee ritenour when i started listening fourplay . before then , i didn't really listen much jazz . friend got me hooked pat metheny , it all started there . this dvd important contribution any jazz fan collection . it spans ritenour career 70s now , it it featuring not only music but also people he played . atmosphere not what i thought it would : rather than " this lee ritenour , these people who i decided allow play me this project , " it " these people good their own right : i brought them here celebrate history , make little well . " dvd also not extended guitar solo . it very much lee ritenour friends . interaction artists this setting amazing watch . fact they all improvise so well , stay close theme piece , bring everything back together when it time says lot quality musicians ritenour assembled this project . dave grusin , ernie watts , patrice rushen , anthony jackson more - these not just studio musicians hired make one man look good . whole this case indeed greater than sum it parts . some standout moments dvd : * set featuring brazilian music ivan lins , including " harlequin . " * ritenour hand-punishing " captain fingers . " * my personal favorite : rendition miles davis ' " blue green . " when i 10 , i used listen am station washington dc played jazz every friday saturday night midnight six morning . this song reminded me lot songs i used listen transistor radio under my pillow . interviews included add lot historical value dvd set . this can't stressed enough - this dvd some long-term value people who serious fans jazz , because way it covers 30-year span time . it also great collection someone whose jazz collection looking bit thin , because right here you see hear some great talent . it clear after 30 years playing jazz , lee ritenour hasn't lost step . this collection proves it , highly recommended	1

" little britain " ( season one ) , me , extremely funny show . until i purchased this dvd , i not familiar this series , i'm certainly , now , very ardent fan . series sketches very well written acted matt lucas david walliams . my god , they so very funny playing all major roles . typical british , aforesaid includes female roles too . " drag " roles seem bring out best matt lucas david walliams . i love almost impossible understand , fast talking , chain smoking , incorrigible --" yeah but no but yeah , shut-up " -- vicky pollard who finds herself , most time , wrong side law . i also really like pudgy , extremely rude ( other fatties ) very condescending marjorie dawes -- leader " fat fighters " . ( her best advise " fat challenged " they eat all dust they want ! ) most all , i adore emily howard unsuccessful transvestite . he tries convince everyone comes within his sights he " real " lady . yes , all named characters played wonderfully matt lucas david walliams . humorous introductions each sketch given resounding voice tom baker which very funny indeedabove , i've named just few my favorites . there many more . if you prude , don't bother this show ; it bound offend you . however , if you like really funny british humor boarders obscene some might consider bad taste ( i don't ) , buy this show ; me it really hysterical .	1
last year , longrunning detective series " monk " ( obsessie-compulsive detective ) got paired new show , lighthearted comedy-mystery series kooky faux-psychic who solves crimes . together , these shows even more delightful , charmingly eccentric characters some very nice writing . fifth season " monk " opens movie made monk ( tony shalhoub ) life amazing abilities , well-known actor david ruskin ( stanley tucci ) monk . but ruskin turns out world best method actor , he observes monk doing his detective work -- starts acquire monk ocd personality . but monk problems don't cease when he paralyzed garbage strike , strike leader murdered . other cases include mysterious electrocution gym shower , blinded murderer , stint private eye , college reunion , disastrous rock concert , leper , marijuana , radio host whose wife died while he air , he competes against technology find serial killer . end monk hour comes time shawn spencer ( james roday ) his long-suffering pal gus ( dul� hill ) . shawn strict , humorless dad coached him since early childhood perfect future cop -- hyperobservant , highly intelligent , perfect detective . but when he reports his observations police , they arrest him -- his only way out pretend psychic . fact , his gimmick works brilliantly -- soon he sets up shop psychic , after plucking gus dull job . among their colourful cases : death spelling bee , haunting sorority house , wedding tainted theft murder , ghostly stalking , cat used witness , civil war reenactments , comic book convention , alien abductions , underground poker , organizing surprise birthday party lassiter . " monk " " psych " lot common . they're both hyperobservant eccentrics , they both solid mysteries some hilarious writing , although monk tends rather sadder tone , compared frothy twentysomething hijinks gus shawn . seen together , these shows seem like two kind . but whatever differences , they both colourful mysteries ( sometimes unexpected twists ) , some deliciously strange dialogue , whether it monk depressed ( " i wish i drank . it wonderful ? " ) or shawn flailing pretending psychic ( " spare me ! spare me ! auuuwwwww ! " ) . comedy , we get see what shaped characters into who they . granted , neither series quite perfect -- monk ocd becomes rather cartoonish few episodes , such his nutty reaction his shrink retiring . mysteries shawn gus solve take little while suitably mysterious -- middle season , they both fun suspenseful , such whole speed-dating episode . leads both shows absolutely delightful -- tony shalhoub hysterical ( such when he tries butler ) , but also heartbreaking , such when monk watches his old wedding video . roday , other hand , just hilarious comic actor . his shawn devoid responsibility or dignity , he rides through luck -- but he good heart , genuinely good detective . both shows great supporting casts , especially hill long-suffering gus , traylor howard monk nurse-sidekick . all cops -- including gray-stanford ormondson -- get plenty character development . they some celebrity appearances : " psych " george takei , while monk some small , hilarious roles alice cooper tucci . sean astin gives glorious performance murderous , spoiled rich brat . fifth season " monk " helped first season " psych " get off ground . these smartly-written , humorous mystery series well-paired , both definitely worth getting	1

director james gray elicited some marvelous performances really eclectic cast : oscar winners ellen burstyn faye dunaway play domestic characters professional verve they always bring ; oscar nominees charlize theron , james caan joaquin phoenix superb their roles wahlberg cousin , best friend uncle-in-law ; then we mark wahlberg , steve lawrence tony musante rounding out cast . this wahlberg shining moment ; he none macho bravado usually associated him , his performance complex , multi-faceted courageous . caan also brilliant , someday he'll get oscar he deserves . phoenix also shows great emotional depth his role borderline sociopath . theron proves she not just pretty face , but capable engaging actress . film slow pace line psychological nuances film . i'd never heard it until i saw trailer video . outstanding film . highly recommended	1

this movie started off promising atmosphere which hinted fun thrills come , but let horribly down laughable special effects , paper-thin clich�'d characters some cringingly awful acting . students ( blonde bimbo , geeky nerd sincere young thing crush stereotypical workaholic prof ) heading off their jeep into wilderness certainly potential , but any attempts build creepy atmosphere isolation diluted spoiled intrusion weak pointless sub-plot army special forces unit battling against insurgents . this military operation ( think arnie team predator meets marines aliens ) gives coolio stage strut his stuff . but , i'm sorry say , convincing he ain't . obliged join forces students , remainder film basically series action set-pieces which humans battle it out pterodactyls . ensuing gore laid very ott style reminiscent evil dead series ( but nowhere near stylish ) creates few ( unintended ? ) laughs . 18 rating certainly undeserved too - there far more effective scary 15 out there . even straight dvd `b ' movies go , this pretty poor fare . final scene hints sequel - they really shouldn't bother	-1

i loved this movie moment i saw it sale my video store discard rack ten years ago . i recently received dvd gift sound quality big improvement over my old vhs copy . i recommend it performances , story photography . jodie foster monologue toward end film particularly memorable . each girl story line realistic film itself good job capturing teen life late 70s before yuppie values took hold . this not john hughes film refreshing change anyone who subjected director teen films 80s	1
i love david lynch , guy so brilliant unique . every single one his movies masterpiece , even though most people don't understand what going . this dvd set we're treated several his short films ; some made while he college , one while he making ' eraserhead ' , one after ' blue velvet ' , one late nineties . make it even better , there introduction each film lynch himself . he talks them , but he doesn't explain them , which cool ... but it would also cool hear explanation him . anyway first film called " six men getting six ( six times ) " which painting he morphed into 3 minute short movie . combined sound siren , it fascinating unique . second short film " alphabet , " which star lynch then wife peggy very creepy 4-minute creation . introduction , lynch actually explains how he got idea . next short film " grandmother , " which he made grant he given american film institute . thing virtually no dialogue makes no sense , but images flash across screen ( young boy plants seed his bed grows grandmother ) very creepy . i think it little too long though . " amputee " features two versions , shot two different kinds black white stock ... well , odd . it like we're suddenly eavesdropping girl who legs amputated . she writing letter aboutt something we no knowledge , while doctor messes her legs which begin shooting some kind liquid . creepy , but not disturbing . next up " cowboy frenchmen " which complete change pace ... it comedy stars harry dean stanton (' wild heart ' ) , jack nance (' eraserhead ' ) , dude you see bunch movies like ' erin brockovich ' ' twin peaks . ' film says lot culture , while stupid but very funny . then we finale , 55-second short called " lumiere . " despite short , it very clever one lynch creepiest creations . this not dvd casual lynch fans . if there david lynch movie you hated , then you not like this movie . people who think eraserhead his best movie definitely love this . people who like mulholland dr. blue velvet no doubt find this interesting . while it not most entertaining dvd market , i enjoyed it immensely . grade : a-	1

i saw this during its theatrical release loved it . when i purchased boxed set peckinpah westerns , it first i played . how it held up ? i would given it five stars back then ; today just four ( which ain't shabby ) . difference represents effect 30+ years my sensibilities more than theatrical viewing versus dvd . cast features excellent performances : jason robards perfect cable ; david warner effective preacher ; peckinpah stalwarts strother martin , . . jones , slim pickins always interesting . clunker , me , stella stevens . whore-with-a-heart-of-gold character type which i problem . it not problem morality ; it problem reality . problem here compounded choice miss stevens . it not her acting - her performance quite good - it her appearance . while scruffy appearances other characters place them plausibly turn-of-the-century arizona , miss stevens appearance screams 1960s southern california . i would found less attractive actress harder edge more effective role . problem here may mine alone ( miss stevens performance widely praised ); i viewed movie more fantasy , miss stevens would not posed problem she . overall , it quibble what otherwise immensely enjoyable film	1

" roots , rock , reggae " documentary showing snapshot reggae music jamaica 1976 . reggae fan , this film offers unadulterated , unique glimpse into island environments fostered one greatest musical genres 20th century . filmmakers show how where music recorded , where it sold , concert footage . more importantly than actual music , this film focuses social cultural roots jamaica national music . they show how it grew crushing poverty areas like trenchtown , its link rastafarianism , how it inexorably linked jamaican politics . features footage lee perry work his black ark studio ( before he burned it down ); interviews jimmy cliff joe higgs ; original concert footage u-roy , gladiators , mighty diamonds , abyssinians , ( very early ) inner circle . film segment bob marley , but not concentrate extensively godfather reggae . course , quality film crude even 1970s standards , but so some greastest reggae ever made - not make it not good ! those interested reggae roots should also check out books " reggae bloodlines , " " reggae explosion : story jamaican music , " " people funny boy " lee perry biography .	1

i not really know what expect when i went see this film . i aware it one biggest grossing french films box office france all time , mysterious beast terrorised french countryside 1760s . i went see it suburban cinema younger members audience sneering french accents subtitles . not last very long , however , because film soon utterly engrossed them , indeed , it myself . samuel le bihan plays adventurer/naturalist who attached royal court versailles . he sent rural region france try trap elusive beast which now responsible increasing number killings . accompanying him his quest ' half brother'- mani ( played veteran martial arts films - mark dacascos . two made welcome chateau local aristocrat there they begin their ques t.t he film not really fall into any genre but draws number . throw martial arts fights , superstitious peasants , beast looks like relative monster ' relic ' , packs wolves , deformed madman , plots overthrow monarchy , you idea what expect .... director christopher gans ( silent hill)has made beautifully photographed multi layered film here . film progresses , gradually reality what going becomes apparent . cinematography superb - particular forest snow sequences which almost enchanted/magical feel them . cast all superb play out their roles relish . film brutal places not hold back gore . indeed , some younger film goers who earlier sneering , becoming quite upset agitated hunting sequences which graphically depict culling local wolves . this unique film well worth look . don't expect it fall into any category though but instead prepare something very different	1
