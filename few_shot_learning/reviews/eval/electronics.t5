i bought this headset retailer ( offline ) , returned it next day . first off , i make it clear i no problems sound . even though speakers could just tiny bit bigger ( they use 40mm drivers ) , sound quality headset just fine . however , when it comes wearing these headphones , only words come mind " uncomfortable sin " . awkward squarish shape cups made it hard get any kind decent seal around ears ( bad seal closed-back headphones ultimately leads poor sound isolation ) . also , i no idea what material they used cup pads , but it nowhere near soft enough ... fact , i litterally couldn't wear these things more than five minutes without my ears turning red ( flush ) discomfort . mind you , i also own cheap pair koss headphones i keep hours time , so my ears definitely no stranger cupped speakers either ... but these things , they just plain hurt wear after very short period time , which isn't good all . discomfort unable obtain good seal around ears ultimately main reasons return . if your ears tough , you should no problem this headset . sound quality decent it should work just fine you . however , if you're looking comfort good sound isolation , you'll want look elsewhere ..	-1

i bought this receiver use preamp my system . i based my decision information stated pioneer web site , attractive price compared some other options i considered . this receiver number good features , but one serious flaw . it not display screen status messages daily operations , like volume sound mode , unless you pioneer display , run special cable receiver tv ( side note , pioneer needs understand we want run less cables our display ) . means you only get see simple set-up screen your non-pioneer tv , which you probably use when you first set up receiver , very infrequently after . ( set-up menu lets you set things like assignable inputs , audio calibtraion . ) sounds like small deal , but many home theaters , including mine , electronics not line site ( mine closet just outside theater infrared repeater system controlling everything . ) this not uncommon , many thier electronics isolated like me or behind cabninet doors , it means i no idea what volume , what sound mode i am using , or anything beyond set-up menu unless i go into closet . bad , bad , bad ! this seems marketing ploy pioneer get you buy pioneer tv projectors , it beyond stupid . if this not case i would rate this receiver much higher , but it serious flaw . it makes using this unit extremely tedious difficul t.t his limitation also means , if you mulitple displays , i plasma tv projector my theater , you need run thier special cable both displays , both pioneer . again , i say bad , bad , bad ! other features stated pioneer website , but they lying when they say this unit screen display , this major drawback users not receiver line site when using thier systems , unless they pioneer display sr+ . ( oh yeah , your pioneer display also equipped sr+ , thier way linking two units . if your pioneer display not equipped sr+ , you again out luck . i mention this bad ?! )25 feb 2007 - addition reveiw : i called onecall they take unit back , but 15% restocking fee , plus paying shipping both ways . while onecall really nothing wrong ( pioneer lying osd ! ) , it one thier vendors not customer fault either customer should not pay this kind fraud . buyer beware onecall , thier customer service this one not good	-1

i pretty excited this player , read it runners ' world . there lot problems it , however . while it advertised sports mp3 player , lot respects it isn't very convenient someone who buys it sports . my issues : - headphones not all appropriate sports , particularly running .. they keep falling off , so i invest better pair headphones . kind weird since it supposed sports player . also , i spent least five minutes everytime untangling them before i could use them . - hard change music while running , it often ends up doing something i don't want it . you can't change music without removing mp3 player armband , which major pain just function bad design you can't tell any picture . - not easy figure out features player , such stopwatch , pedometer . also hard use once you figure it out . - software pain use . - organization songs annoying difficult maneuever player . said , i still use it . there some good features : - long battery life , recharges super quick- very cool-looking player- very easy carry around .. slip it pocket or bag any size . i would not recommend this player if given choice , i would not buy it again .	-1

beware kingston rebates ! course , i hope your experience would differ , if you buy kingston product(s ) , but mine terrible . i bought kingston compactflash card offered $50 mail-in rebate . i promptly ( , day after i received item delivery ) went photocopy my rebate certificate upc code sales receipt ; then sent it all its merry way . yes , i well within rebate period , both purchase postmark date . my purchase valid retailer ( think huge online e-tailer ) . rebate required sending entire original upc label , which like entire outside package my cf card , size 1 � business cards when flattened . no problem . two months later , i get letter saying " your rebate request denied because you failed furnish appropriate original upc code required rebate offer . " well , now what ? i can't re-send original ( it already their possession ) . i called , they insisted repeating what letter said . i re-sent my photocopies they said photocopy invalid proof purchase . after 6 weeks pursuing this , i figured this their scam . they simply wouldn't honor rebate . without original upc my possession , i couldn't really submit their requirements . if you're looking ram upgrade , i'd suggest you look quality company like ocz ( best ! ) , or patriot , geil , or corsair . if you're looking value flash memory card , i might suggest sandisk . one , kingston not make best products , they value-driven products . two , there competitors kingston just good or better value-to-performance ratios same prices . three , kingston not stand behind their customer i experienced . i urge you , please , cautious kingston their rebate scams	-1

these $10 headphones . there nothing amazing them my opinion . i bought them use my ipod when i'm out , or work . right out box , i disappointed fit , i know everyone going different , but me they just aren't comfortable . sound quality clear , but very thin lacking bass . even when i'm pressing them into my ears get best possible fit , bass just isn't good . eq settings boost bass don't help either , often reduce sound quality even more . ear clips don't really seem much either . they kind keep them your ears but don't really hold them your ears all . ear pieces tend get tangled together easily well . summary , i wouldn't recommend these music , but if you want cheap pair headphones listening audio books or some other kind spoken word , they might good-if you tolerate them your ears long	-1

belkin tunetalk fabuous using ipod digital recorder . i very good results recording various music rehearsals ( children choir big band ) without external powered microphone ( sony ecm-ms908c stereo mic ) attached . since i already mic , total cost very low compared purchasing something like zoom digital recorder this type recording . i haven't plugged it into mixing board yet . i suspect it would produce even better recording decent pair mics through mackie 1202 or better . i bought usb power adaptor so i wouldn't worry battery drain . it plugs into tunetalk provides power ipod . no , it isn't good high dollar recorder , dedicated mic-pre pair neumann mics . serious recording requires serious equipment . however , all those other recordings , tunetalk stereo great recording option $60 your trusty ipod .	1

i've used sd-yd250 hundreds times over last 2 years it still shows no significant signs wear . overall , product five star because its reliability labor-saving convenience . i've used it equally baking bread making pizza dough . it also save lot money , provided you purchase yeast bulk ( example 2lb ) . single use yeast packages which typically only buying option american supermarkets cost 20 times more per gram . particularly great savings possible when using it make pizza dough . this takes tedious work out making your own pizza , when dough refrigerated later use , it tastes even better my opinion . like most engineered products our age , this one full cute features add little value , or cause annoyance . yeast dispenser makes marginal difference best . if you use it , you ( most part ) create extra work yourself because you'll clean it later . dozens different bake modes make product more complicated use . they make marginal difference baking results . i only use quick bake mode , which takes 2 hours complete . let say you make mistake start unit using wrong settings ( easy given many parameters you set ) . you just push reset or cancel button start over , right ? nope , no such button exists . then unplug unit plug it back , right ? nope , engineers decided it would cute feature protect against power outages , so unit remembers where it left off . yes , but instruction manual states you wait 10 minutes , after 10 minutes it forget , right ? nope , i tried this , too . unit indeed forget eventually , but it more than 11 minutes . if you plug it back too early , timer resets you wait again . summarize , hardware excellent , software controls it could hardly dumber	1

i bit skeptical this purchase , although i previously owned one first harmony remotes pre-logitech days very pleased it . some reviews bit off-putting , particularly 890 its rf option , so i went 880 i am glad i . despite comments others on-line programming superb - all my components already database . certainly i very familiar process programmed my first remote through 3 evolutions components before selling it total package . any event process hassle free i now fully integrated control my replay tv , cable box , tv , receiver , dvd vcr just i hoped . control process seamless , provided you realize remote sending stream ir commands needs kept pointed system until remote tells you command complete all works great . ( fact remote tells you keep pointing system great improvement over my prior unit . ) my only slight critique remote not similar prompt when you switch off so you inadvertently move remote too quickly leave something should off . however help process quickly resolve this when you switch again . rechargeable batteries good innovation too - i no problem locating unit charging base . overall i thoroughly recommend 880 .	1
this fashionable keyboard spruce up any workstation or gaming environment compared typical ho-hum keyboard . lcd screen nice feature ( toy ) but i find myself rarely using it most apps games don't support it . two usb ports very handy would especially so anyone without frontside usb their towers . it worth buying anyone situation . blue lighting keys make them easier read dim room but doesn't help much truly dark room . macro keys plentiful easy use . all-in-all well worth buy anyone wanting something looks nicer then typical keyboard , anyone needing easy access usb ports anyone needing macro keys . people may also want give new vista keyboard microsoft look	-1
i little tentative order itrip lcd because some bad reviews i read . it seems like there very few people sitting fence this item . buyers either love it or hate it . i leaving trip hoped itrip would arrive so i could use it my drive . luck would it , it my mailbox day before i left . i unwrapped it went out vehicle test it . i plugged it into my 20gb ipod photo right off bat thought i trouble . it wouldn't power up , i tried plugging unplugging , cleaning contacts finally last resort , read instructions . after plugging it you play song before it power . this immediately explains why so many poeple complain doas right out box . i set frequency lowest available fm band presto !!! instant music . i don't live extremely populated area so i can't really comment other stations bleeding through but loud passages loud quiet passages quiet . many reviewers complained bad sound quality but you must remember this . it doesn't matter how great quality song your ipod , you playing it over fm radio so it never sound better than fm radio . i inherited my father ' 91 accord work car when he retired it bare bones am/fm radio tone control(bass treble all rolled into one handy knob !!! ) cheap 6 1/2 inch speakers front doors . when i drive i like listen talk radio podcasts occasionally music . sound quality exactly what i expected , no better no worse . i also tested it my wife ' 01 focus . it nice factory 6 speaker cd system sound ipod just fine . bass still thumped highs seemed just tiny bit off but still not bad all . i am completely satisfied product . one strange thing i noticed may explain why some people complain bad sound quality if you tap itrip , sound comes through your speakers much like tapping microphone . if you lay it hard surface your vehicle you could probably hear it through your speakers when encountering rough road . unless there defective batch sent out , i don't know where all complaints come . i got mine $15 private seller amazon consider it great purchase especially amount money . don't hesitate buy one , it works advertised sound quality what it . if you keep these things mind , you won't disappointed	-1
it speedy space saving inexpensive . i bought this replace my belkin because belkin needed plugged . this one powered your computer so there no extra power cords , which big plus me . only thing i dislike this fact hub takes up two usb ports instead just one like belkin .	1

i like features . i'm satisfied sound . user interface could more intuitive . however , my overriding complaint docking port ( many other reviewers mentioned ) not reliable . connection poorly constructed , so just walking table which it sits often enough make it think ipod isn't there any more . if they could fix this quality problem , it would well worth $100 , but since it very hard get it recognize connection reliably you just can't justify it any price	-1

this review little long-winded , but i am going share you my experiences after burning hundreds dvds . after all , many us archiving data / video we want able access decades into future currently there no other reviews this product site . i used just every type recordable dvd media available concluded fuji offers best value . i recommend you stick fuji dvd-rs made japan . this important since there multiple manufacturers who make recordable dvds fuji ( not uncommon industry ) . end user , dvds different manufacturers ( all under fuji name ) look nearly identical . you might want take time google then download free utility program named dvd identifier . you simply put your recordable dvd into your computer dvd writer dvd identifier tell you who actually manufactured dvd ( many you might surprised brand name disc actual manufacturer often different ) . example , fuji dvds made japan made taiyo yuden ( one - if not most - reputable manufacturers out there ) . fuji dvds made taiwan made entirely different manufacturer . both japan taiwan fuji dvds look nearly identical packaging share common proof purchase code . however , one set note made japan under proof purchase code other set note made taiwan under proof purchase code . other way distinguish packages made japan dvds plastic spindle cover flush against black spindle base . made taiwan dvds black base stick out slightly . i heard some people say digital digital all dvds created equal . this not true . you want buy dvd manufactured quality . you might save few cents buying cheaper dvd ; however , you factor bad burns lost data . cheapo dvds , you more coasters more dvds initially burn fine , but lose data after few months . past two years , i burned over 1,000 made japan fuji dvds only six bad burns not yet experienced lost data any hundreds successful recordings . i use these fuji dvds more than any other brand . i also use panasonic dvd-rs ( also manufactured taiyo yuden ) well unlabeled dvds online wholesaler also manufactured taiyo yuden . fuji dvds attractive silver color top , panasonics attractive gold color top . panasonic dvds also much more expensive than fujis . terms compatibility , i played fuji dvds over 20 different dvd players yet find player not play my video recorded fuji dvd . 50 pack fuji spindle regularly goes sale $20 variety retailers .	1

this very well designed . it give you 4 usb port but two opposite sides . this very clever becase you plug devices both sides . you webcam or cell your left your mouse number pad your right . cord plug hub computer very sterdy yet flexible so you not only adjust hub all kind angles , it would stay angle not twist all around you wires . it also works great if you jsut want charge you usb devices go . it come plug ac adapter so you don't need bring your computer you charge youd devices	1
well , begin , i am complete ipod hater . whole idea wasting buttload money something limited features doesn't sit right me . but after robbing my bro his so long , since i none , it time get something my own . i chose this walkman bean player . size sick ! fits few fingers . also , it sony , trusted company , unlike apple who give you runaround . navigation menu so simple . i didn't read manual i figured it out . only thing i read manual figue how change station radio , but negligible . anyhow , i looooove it . great bargain , sound investment	1
guess you sometimes pick good one over hundreds bad ones ... i might say i lucky .... or price this litte lcd worth price paid ... this lcd filling 2 pairs shoes very nicely ... it used kitchen tv used computer monitor .. very satisfied tv picture .. very clear sharp .. great picture .. good back lighting , not dull or dim some other lcd i've seen ... sound ok but little thin my liking so i added some cheap amplified speakers which really helps .. great computer monitor also .. just clear functional my high end hp monitor .. refreshes 60hz no issues .... would i buy again .. or ... perhaps but i would test it out before purchase if all possible ... there some bad apples every bunch .. overall my purchase this lcd tv complete success my needs ..	1

i bought lexar professional 512 when digital rebal first came out whopping $230 . it write speed 40x . i needed buy bigger card becuase when i took pictures events i not enough memory keep changing my jpeg quality . kingston great choice . not only it four times memory but great price go it . i would recommend this product most photographers . only down side i write speed claims 50x my lexar 40x seems faster . if you action photographer this not card you , this why i not give it five star rating . i went vacation this month plenty room spare card . it everything i needed it .	-1

this 1st ipod i've ever , i've using it constantly since purchase 3 months ago ( gym , work , commuting , planes ) . no real problems so far . size excellent , look sheek , navigating wheel lot easier use than i told it going . battery life not too bad , i would say it used 10 hours before battery picture turns red . i am dissapointed capacity- 500 songs really nothing people who've buying cds 10+ years enjoy variation their listenting sessions . i also dissapointed you can't anything playlists ipod itself- basically everything ( eg , creation playlists , deletion songs , moving around songs ) computer uploaded ipod . recommended gym-goers frequent travelers	1
this product perfect . it sturdy case holds my large collection cd dvd . my other cases flimsy wore out fast . this one hard outside shell inside holds my dvd nicely . so i no complaints . price i paid i'd say this great deal	1

this card 2 gb ultimate 120x it tested write speed 120 times 150kb/sec which exceeds 18 mb per second . frequently card manufacturers advertise their read speed , which always much faster . analyze your file size pictures you take speed mb/sec tell you how many those pictures you store one second . impacts time pictures . cameras , write speed most important , but speed rating card doesn't necessarily tell you its write speed . music players other devices , read speed may more important . so you might choose different card depending whether you intend use it play music or take pictures . i'm currently shopping sd cards camera capability shoot 3 pictures per second large file sizes . order not slow camera down , i need fast card . i some research realized reviews here aren't necessarily even related this particular card , but all different sizes speeds kingston cards . kingston memory business long time they conservative their ratings . this card #1 my list right now because its tested write speed	1

logitech scored big plus this item . important thing you really need processing power device run properly . first review really unfair . logitech not hide fact you really should using nulooq g5 processor . it says so right box . i'm using it g4 1.8 ghz i feel i'm behind bit power . review nulooq g4 800mhz ludicrous . course it won't perform rigid standards todays graphic professionals underpowered box . hook this thing up your updated mac you'll see it shine . my workflow streamlined i enjoy more tedious tasks more than i ever . good job this one . i recommend it highly	1
this card works great significantly less expensive than it local retail stores . matter fact , i just ordered one yesterday	1

some people seem issues but i loved mine . i live boston area itrip always worked fine 88.3 - 88.5 range . not fantastic sound but more than adequate . portability huge plus well - i used it playing my ipod over radios hotel rooms when traveling , radios friends ' houses , . itrip considerably more useful than tape player adaptor far more reliable . i never found tape player adaptor worked well consistently . price convenience you can't beat this thing . only drawback it not work newer generation ipods	-1
this review pertains specifically targus pauh217u 4 port ultra mini usb 2.0 hub . cord 2.5 feet long - long enough reach my pc , which sits ground , top desk . it cable which split into two usb plugs - one just transmit data , second power unit . second plug not need used unless you plan using some heavy-duty hardware , if so what you buying hub called ultra mini anyways ? if you insist trying run blow dryer off thing , then it input separate power source , which you buy separately . short , if you old school machine usb ports which inaccessible /inconvenient use , this little hub give you quick access while taking up minimal space your desk	1
you never ask more this product . 2700mah . that huge . runs my discman weeks ( i roughly listen 1 hr everyday ) . digital display very good accurate . refresh feature what makes it different other similar products . now forget " memory " bug your battery . given price , it worth your while	1

i bought this product after reading several reviews here amazon . setup configure it my cable system little tricky , but once we got passed , it worked like charm . i only lost one recording one my dvds . it strange how happened , since dvd wasn't player time . but almost year ago it hasn't happened since then . this recorder intuitive simple operate . conversion video dvd flawless , finalization process easy understand well . i especially like how you adjust recording time . mine currently set four hours . i am totally blind needed product easy me operate without sighted assistance . this definitely fills bill ! if you're looking great product reasonable price , buy this one ! you won't disappointed ! i've converted almost 50 videos recorded several tv shows this recorder ! great buy	1

i trying find way easily carry lot camera equipment quite some time . i tried backpacks , shoulder bags , duffel bags , but none them really worked all well . then i saw lowepro street field system completely customizable pouches , vests , belts , accessories . it works great , you only get pouches you need so there no waisted space you organize them however you want according how often they used ( put frequently used items easier access places . ) variety alone this system worth investment , but quality ease use also very high which big plus . you get case any lens , camera body , or accessory you . i even cases my cell phone water bottle . one word caution , sure measure your lens lens hood backwards if you use them make sure entire thing fit into pouch , because sometimes lens fit , but then lens lens hood not . i often carry 5-6 lenses , extension tubes , teleconverters , extra memory cards batteries , bunch cleaning supplies other gadgets , which weights ton . but when they evenly distributed this vest/belt lowepro system it actually very manageable . only down side everyone staring you because you thousands dollars camera equipment strapped your body . but if you overlook , this way go . i used this system many zoos without ever problems , fact just unzipping single lens switching seems safer me than opening entire bag equipment every time you want switch lenses . many cases also come built rain/snow cover so if weather changes all your equipment not destroyed . you also put just few pouches normal belt when you just going take photos back yard or don't need take all your equipment , which nice . i really can't say enough how much easier this makes traveling lot equipment , if you hopelessly searching better solution , consider this , you won't regret it .	1
after going through reviews , i bought this cf card my canon digital rebel . so far it worked fine , though i don't pretend expert digital photographer . when card empty , it shows 127 shots available . it seems read reasonably fast , though it takes bit longer than i used my point-and-shoot olympus its smartmedia card .	1
got my order quickly found out these cases much better than ones sold here locally , they cheaper !!	1
its very helpfull when you manage several sd cards , its faster very reliable !	1
i make this review very simple . no matter what features you find attractive this remote , its shear size makes thing clunky unuseable . unless you large hands , you trouble accessing all buttons without 2 handing it . ( make sure you go retail store hold it first before you buy it)in terms features , remote only simplest " learning " features . if you want custom interface piece hardware it doesn't code .... good luck	-1
i've it over month now it works well i expected it work . i expecting random quirks here there i continued using it , but none whatsoever	1

first short background - tv i previous panasonic plasma 50 " panasonic rear projection lcd three years old . source materials i regularly view consist dish satellite tv using s-video dvd/wii/xbox 360 using component video . after much deliberation , i decided go plasma over lcd due cost better pq , although cheaper , i avoided lcos/dlp due poor viewing angles other pq issues similar those i my rp-lcd . i ended up choosing panasonic over pioneer models due significantly cheaper price because it only missing some very minor enhancements comparable pioneer models . th-50px60u awesome i don't regret purchase all . i would say it best bang buck far plasma arena . all said , i some advice potential buyers . these tvs most sensitive first 100 hours use still require some care precautions taken during following 400 hours use . reduce likelihood image retention it highly recommended not play video games static status bars and/or huds extended periods ( i'd say 1hr plus ) , use zoom aspect ratio adjust picture so station id logos covered watch letterboxed dvds zoom function during first 100-ish hours . doing some investigation online should lead you breakin dvd used accelerate breakin time slightly make sure all phosphors lit evenly across entire panel . hopefully some you find this information helpful	1
product works fine first it pretty quiet but then when we put it night while we're sleeping you notice it makes some clicking sounds every once while . other than it 3 different speeds , used ionizer ( but i can't tell difference ) , oscillates timer control . over all i'd say it great product amount money i paid . it also pretty tall which nice remote control	-1

i purchased this card use my fujifilm finepix s5000 camera family vacation . i researched it beforehand make sure i could use this card camera . there " " " " card ( apparently , they save things different format " " card not allow taking videos this camera ) . i purchased " " card , used it mostly take still photos . upon returning home downloading photos ( 505 ) my computer , i extremely disappointed find once i copied them my computer , i unable view them my camera anymore ( i not choose erase them card ) . i got error message camera , my only choice format card ( which meant everything would erased ) . i wasn't happy , but i couldn't view photos anyway , so i format it . one problem . other problem i several photos displayed question marks my computer , no image all . others looked fine thumbnails , but when opened , top half them fine , but bottom half either solid gray , or spliced repeated . it crazy ! these memories can't recaptured , so it very upsetting . i not trust card all , i not purchase one !	-1
this if my first flat screen tv but after much research i determimed this one most bang buck . so far so good , i am very pleased picture sound quality . most reviews i read lcd tvs point out issue black contrast . one thing i increase brightness level almost max order bring out contrast when viewing shows dark scenes but level seems work ok all viewing . i highly recommend this product	1
this uber-sleeve or micro-attache sound , good looking ruugedly constructed - no complaints there . however , attache it comes up short . it so perfectly sized my macbook pro 15.4 " laptop , there virtually no room there anything else . some papers , maybe dvd or two , but that it . there not even close enough space bring my power supply . once already once i left my bag all packed , only discover i also eft my power supply behind . ok , so maybe it just sleeve ... except it ever so slightly too big comfortably fit inside my oversized messenger bag ! what up !! i find i wind up going places two bags , feels bit silly . nice included ( but uneeded ) padded sholder-strap went straight my binoculars . all alternatives i found shopping around online , this one still seems best , but there one futuristic black ? orange molded neoprene skin-snug case merits deeper inspection . perhaps case ( also designed specificaly macbook pro ) more streamlined its exterior dimensions . good news brenthaven edge ii , i know my gear well protected . conclusion : nothing perfect	-1
i highly recommend bose wave radio ii after one month , here pros cons : pros : * excellent sound quality volume . plays full sound spectrum well - deep bass notes high octave soprano . turn volume up " very loud " before sound distortion audible , so it easy listen radio one room while working or while cleaning house . * small space requirements . easily fits top bedside cabinet bedside lamp . remote control right-sized too , only slightly larger than credit card . * good features . alarm clock works well input jack comes handy if you want listen cd or xm satellite radio through portable external player . * ease use . very intuitive easy-to-use design remote control radio , able use everything without referencing product manual . * esthetics envy . this radio looks great , people ask it when they see it . * resale value . you won't find used bose wave radio cheap ebay or amazon marketplace , bose radios tend hold their resale value well over time . * made america . you may feel more patriotic after buying it . cons : * cost . definitely more expensive than other radios , but considering quality resale value , it probably good value overall . if you rewards credit card , radio might obtained ( " free " ) using accumulated credit card points -- many credit card points catalogs ( i.e. , diners club rewards catalog ) wave radi o.o verall , excellent product highly recommended . keep up good work bose	1
i admit , these one downfall : they not very durable . they last 2-4 months . but besides , they great . these only earphones stay your ear while running , biking ( careful , dont let cord get tangled o_o ) , etc . sound pretty good . just one note : careful earphones , since their unique shape blessing or burden ( they tangle unless you use their shape your advantage when storing	1

" take our advice not skimp cable or you regret it . one find it 40% discount internet auction sites . let us caution against buying toshiba this way , though . some internet marketers retail new hdtvs which " grade units . " sold cheaply because their hdtvs " not quite perfect . " we would not care wrangle this monster back inside carton re-ship it across country we get lemon . too much trouble , too much time w/o tv . my son college he sells hdtvs part time electronics store . they not carry toshiba hdtvs ' short-circuit city .

i netgear router this wireless usb adapter . i used router wgt624 several months just firewall directly hooked into my computer never any problems . few days ago however i moved my computer decided use this usb card nothing but problems since . half time start up my computer not connected so i reboot . sometimes multiple reboots then it still doesn't work i unhook everything , router , cable modem , etc . i don't know how or why this happens but it seems make everything stuck nothing communicate again until i this . this happened several times so i am not imagining this . i try various things but ultimately i shut everything down actually unplug modem power source few seconds then start everything back up . i cable this procedure they you sometimes if things get locked up , usually when you bad connection . i didn't this when it just hooked into router , but this usb p.o.s. i am doing it every day , sometimes several times day . then it shows connection like 55% router very next room . door open , not 20 feet away . even now i sit here writing this little computer task bar showing my connection dropped yellow . least it hasn't changed red ........... crap , just , not #%^%$ kidding ! ..................... okay , back line . this absolute p.o.s. which i would take back except i got it package deal router i bought it long time ago but never used it till now . when it work it quick . but when key word there . yourself favor , buy something else ! don't corporations test this crap before they mass market it ?!?	-1

i love this product . i purchased edge 305 go new bike , it easy install , decent instructions . it easy get started using it . it gives all information you could possibly want your ride , its simple download . some people might think its too much information , but you tailor data fields displayed see little or much info you want . data ( milage , elevation ) appears very accurate . down side , display hard read sunlight . i've played around contrast tool , but still problems . i also think use instructions could clearer , my first ride , i couldn't figure out why i wasn't getting milage , later realized you turn it ! i'm used bike computers start automatically . changing data fields displayed bit pain , i want timer showing when i'm indoor trainer , % grade when i'm road , its pain constantly switch fields . also , if data field not displayed because you don't need see it constantly , ( average speed comes mind ) you change data fields displayed view info , then change back if you not end your ride . i am fortunate because several people my bike club edge 305 they could answer questions so i didn't constantly thumb through instruction manual . software comes edge very basic , but i no complaints it . all issues i mentioned above annoyances rather than problems i feel this great product i recommend it anyone who not intimidated all features .	1

i found myself position where i needed convert over 50 long audio cassettes several dats cd possibly mp3 later . prospect use my computer not inviting , i need computer other things it would forced me buy large drive deal files . after some research into few cd recorders available judging other reviews here , i decided go this model since it around same price hard drive i would needed . this couldn't simpler device use . especially my dat player , hook up supplied optical cable , adjust audio level record . it automatically creates tracks , either silent areas certain length or track divisions encoded dat . audio cassettes little more tricky automatic track division only activated if tape hiss below certain db . easy adjustment fix . anyway , creation cd couldn't easier : push record ( it activates pause mode ) , start your playback deck , release pause , leave it alone until playback finished , hit stop activate finalization . minute ten seconds later you cd . so hour playback takes hour five minutes create cd . much faster then computer . audio quality excellent my ear . there three issues note . first , unit only accepts music cd-r discs which not available data cd-r discs even nyc . second , unit sometimes not playback just finalized disc goes into error mode , reboot recorder fixes problem disc plays perfectly . i haven't discovered reason but i suspect tdk blanks i am using . third , unit not recognize end last track you recording if you aren't careful you could end up very long final track . it would nice if there option recorder would stop recording if there programmable length silence . i now set cds play any cd player i easily convert mp3 computer when time comes . saved lot time aggravation	-1

i don't much basis comparison , my only other hd antenna unamplified plastic metal 8 " triangle jobbie came my receiver . i researched heavily before settling terk-sp . it works great , but not perfect i might hoped . i live major city where every station hd version , i've always able get them all , but signal typically so weak some stations , they would constantly cut out me . strong outdoor antenna solved problem almost completely . cheap indoor antenna i before picked up all same channels , but sporadic connectivity . i constantly moving it around improve weak signal . real pain . when i got terk-sp , first thing i noticed it pretty light . plastic cover plastic backing even pear-shaped picture-hook eyehole back hanging antenna wall . pretty unique idea . it " amplified " antenna , but refers design . it doesn't plug into wall socket or anything or use any extra power . one thing i really like this antenna way it looks ... like square satellite dish . i live apartment among sea dishes , so unique terk-sp really stands out ( 16 " , it same size too ) . package includes mounting arm adjustable bracket . it not include grounding rod or grounding block ( get both radio shack $14 $5 respectively ) . if you mounting this antenna outdoors , you need them . static electricity builds up inside coax cable ( this true all antennas ) fry your tv ( i discovered this hard way , accidentally touching cable my hand after few days use shocking living daylights out my thumb ! ) your coax antenna cable needs go terk " mounting block " you place grounding rod you sink ground , then run second wire other side block your tv . this protect your expensive equipment . if you keep terk indoors without mounting it , you probably don't need ground it , so i don't blame audiovox not including them . reception wise , quick test , i disconnected my cheapo antenna terk soon it arrived tuned my worst station . i saw immediate 30% signal boost than before one station ! great . unfortunately , don't expect 30% boost * every * channel . more than likely , any station you could get before ( even really badly ) , you'll get good steady signal terk-sp . but any channel whose signal often drops 0% any reason , you're probably not going get terk because 0 times 30% still 0 . when i first installed terk-sp , i even ( intermittently ) picked up entirely new ( obscure out-of-town ) station i never got before , but some reason , i haven't able pick it up again weeks . mounting time took 45 minutes . screw mounting arm post or rooftop ( brackets/clamps mounting terk round post come it ) , antenna arm . then run your cable inside your tv . that it . short answer : this great antenna should work great long you already receive * steady * signal ( least minute or two ) your local stations . terk-sp flat-face design works best areas where it pick up " reflected " signals off neighboring buildings such . i suspect benefits terk-sp might lost if you live middle nowhere no place signals bounce off . also , hd signals very directional , so it helps not live location where you surrounded stations coming you different directions . you need point your antenna direction " generally " right direction all stations . it took two people properly adjust my terk best possible reception ( " little left . no , signal stronger back right . " ) . positioning options left/right , tilt twist ( low number stations taller signals like antenna whose face more * parallel * ground ) . terk-sp works great i highly recommend it , but i don't really know how it compares other antennas since i've never tried them , but i tell you i am now getting strong steady signals stations i received only intermittently before	-1

i older ipod photo got very banged up simple everyday use . scratches dings abound it . new 30gb video ipod i bought also black , which means fingerprints would problem , scratches more obvious . i bought isee so i wouldn't deal scratching -- if i scratches case , i'd buy new case 1/15 what ipod cost . however , i also didn't want my case try " dress up " my ipod . one reasons i like ipod because it ( imo ) best-looking media player marke t.t he isee good case these purposes , contrary earlier reviews , pops off easily , but requires very specific pressure . pulling top case around ' hold ' switch makes case pop off . case only goes one way , so you avoid what happened my griffin iclear , which i clumsily broke attaching back side upside down , effect , locking case such i physically fracture bottom case . won't happen ( thankfully ) isee . isee also clearer ( ironically ) than iclear back side ipod , which i like . unfortunately , though , you might disappointed if you apple universal dock , because you force ipod into dock -- it too wide fit comfortably isee it	-1

if sound quality you're looking equated old mini-transitor radio , you might pleased . even so , you would probably expect pay around $15 product - not something $40 plus range ! like reviewer , i very low expectations such small speakers but apparently not low enough . speakers cannot handle bass all avoid complete sound distortion you need keep volume very low which essentially forces you literally within foot or two unit . furthermore , there no easy way retreive your ipod once inserted ! i feel i deceived 5 star reviews i used make my purchasing decision felt obligated respond . miniblaster good concept poorly executed i'm afraid i wasted my money .	-1
i owned this printer over six months yet any problems it . used daily basis , my printer still original set cartridges still produces quality prints even near end cartridges . photos , images , text always sharp , rich , far beyond quality my lexmark epson printers ' results . even though it advertised photo printer , it works well all types documents prints amazingly fast . printer able print memory cards , copy , scan media while your pc off . " color " " black " buttons producing copies help make copying very simple . these stand-alone features worked well me , but there one minor annoyance : you cannot scan memory card , only pc . other than this , my only other complaints mp500 must usb passthrough port work there slight red tint photos default . after using other entries competing photo all-in-one lines , i recommend mp500 highest am most satisfied this printer	-1

this kvm switch very solidly constructed - metal case , high quality cables push button switch ( my opinion , push button switch better than soft switch ) . because its weight , it doesn't get dragged around cables . it works power drawn usb connections , but it also comes its own power , which nice . it also additional usb port which you use share usb device such webcam or usb microphone . what really nice i actually connect this usb port my dell monitor which built-in usb hub , so now i 4 extra usb ports . i " blue screen death " few days when switching computers after installing this kvm switch , but problem went away after i disconnected old webcam connected switch . if you're using windows , it takes few seconds mouse keyboard become active after switching . linux , it takes almost no time . if you find video quality low ( e.g. fuzziness ) , try adjust your monitor settings . when i first plugged it , resolution wasn't good , it looked fuzzy . but after " auto adjust " my monitor , it became very sharp . tech support connectpro seems responsive . i emailed them " blue screen death " problem couple times got replies promptly . their tech support also skype , although i never tried talk him . only real shortcoming this kvm switch it usb 1.0 instead usb 2.0 . windows xp complains this everytime you switch it . i give this switch 4-star because this . btw , anyone know why indicator button shows half-red half-green when it switched it ? it against common engineering practice	-1

though i rated it 1 star , i'd give it none if option . i really don't like write negative reviews , but i feel other parents need warned when product isn't worth price shipping , much less price itself . i thought this would make fun practice piano my three year old son . he began piano lessons recently needs practice fingering motions keyboard . i wanted something small few bells whistles thought this little keyboard would perfect practicing piano fingering . i put 6 fresh batteries it when it arrived ( it not come ac adaptor mentioned instruction manual ) turned it . 3 seconds , there fairly nice song . after it gets garbled makes horrid static sound . i poured over instructions figure out what i doing wrong . nowhere it mentioned it should making this ear-splitting garbled static no matter what button you press . worst part - it probably cost me more ship it back than i'll get refund . this utter piece junk waste plastic . never again i buy item hasn't reviewed amazon.com . save your money , willing spend bit more , find better keyboard . frankly , i can't believe amazon.com would sell this product or not least test it before selling it	-1

first glance , comprehensive feature set these phone impressive , including such perks wall mountable , room monitor mode if you more than one handset , different ringtones , 2.4 5.8 ghz . these same features turn out well-nigh inaccessable , or compromised point uselessness . only main unit wall mountable , satellites not . if your phone jack not near wall you want mount , you no options . this important if you use voip . don't expect mount kitchen handset wall . room monitor , or baby monitor , frankly idiotic . it suggested monitor sleeping baby . batteries grant perhaps half hour eavesdropping if you're lucky enough activate mode first place . you need negotiate menu after menu dig it up , after which one phone emits very loud tone . second phone then rings loudly well , when you confirm it you them beep same time . believe me , baby not sleeping any more . there many ringtones packaged phone , all uniformly universally irritating . best sounds tinny cheap , worst makes you scramble phone just end its metallic shriek . 2.4 ghz grants very little range ; i've lost contact thin intervening wall twenty feet space . my old cheaper panasonic allowed me stroll mailbox without static call . you cannot dial your voicemail speakerphone mode , phonebook speaker buttons tiny , talk button , which also hangs up call , huge placed dead center phone . cough you've hung up . callers need identify themselves now , you confident you no longer recognize their voices . i already mistaken friend voice his sister , embarassed them both mistake , embarassed myself i , normally careful shopper , purchased such techno dud . i warned against uniden products should heeded those warnings . when these phones expire , i go back panasonic . unfortunately , i must grant these phones extra star because they seem built well , although not very rugged . heavy uncomfortable hold , they probably withstand impact well enough i not able justify purchasing new phones anytime soon . update ; spoke too soon . first one broke this morning , fall wood floor . other one managed drop call five feet base . two cans string would better . i suspect rave reviews this phone received because other reviewers haven't tried better phones . this phone ultimately suffers lack ergonomics- uncomfortable , unintelligible , inaccessible . skip it something else	-1

i bough this product after reading several reviews other people . pros : toshiba gigabeat really nice design perspective , look feel pleasant . software well designed pretty intutive . though it doesn't click wheel like ipod , but i didnt find any problem using it going through various menus . they all well designed visually much more better than i-pod or other similar players . it takes some time get use buttons other controls , but once you get accustomed then its zip . cons : i returned this player after one week , because biggest killer it battery life , it hardly lasts 6 hours . you cant expect mp3 player last just 6 hour . if i am outta my house , i should able play it least 12 hours ... thats only problem which i find this , which undid all its goodness . overall good player , if you live short battery life	-1

i've used hp a516 compact photo printer month now . i got it sale christmas $50 . what great deal ! few things note : 1 . best photo paper use this hp advanced photo paper . i bought some hp premium plus photo paper thinking since it more expensive , print quality ought better . however , this not so ! apparently , vivera ink specially formulated print hp advanced paper , which produces even-quality laydown ink , no defined edges different colors photo . hp premium plus photo paper showed defined edge blank ink , giving it " home-printed " look photo . hp advanced paper produced photo-lab quality prints looked awesome ! 2 . if you edit or crop any photos photoshop before you print it out , you should save file " baseline ( standard ) " format , otherwise printer not recognize " optimized " file type . 3 . buy ink cartridges paper directly hp site save money . they often great deals ink -- buy-one-get-one free or some other gimick . i managed buy paper ink price so it costs me $0.29 per print ( ink+paper costs ) . pros : - 4x6 photos truly borderless ! you can't tell prints come off inkje t-t ype printer . - photos printed off 1 photo per page , or more fun features -- 2 or 4 photos per page ! you choose same pictures all 4 wallet-sized photos , or choose 4 different photos print size . - you also print any frame mpeg ( video ) printer ease . just play video file stop it frame you want printed . it easy ! only thing resolution quality lower , but it looks pretty good video shot . ( this could improved other cameras , but this what i noticed my canon sd630)- instant photos ! this little printer prints rather quickly hp advanced quick-drying paper , photos ready handling jiffy ! - printer truly compact . it really cute , placed anywhere without taking up much space .	1

so many parents , i believe , don't care if toy educational . they just want quiet object their child focus so it doesn't interrupt mom or dad television show . this really more true instrument than toy . it educational . there manual comes it it teaches you how use it . you , smart parent , want read it first know how use it yourself so you spend several hours focusing your child learning how use it well . if you think music important you read manual . if you couldn't care less , then keep manual your child read his/her own so he/she get best use out instrument when they old enough read it their own . if you're annoyed noises music your kid blast pushing pulling instrument , then don't buy it . my personal feeling kids should given opportunities experience these kinds things , so if you want junior sit corner play quiet video game , don't bother buying this . this instrument also give your child exposure learn how play other instruments well . just like learning language , once you master one you much more easily learn others . same true musical instruments . learn this , your child learned how read music , playing ear , fingerings , chords , etc . so much better than something your child doesn't even use brain cell master	1
past i used backpack transport my laptop my work ( i teach college ) . perhaps it age , but backpack seemed very cumbersome heavy so i lookout nice rollerbag . this one really fit bill . like previous reviewer , i looked ton bags very petite ( 5'1 " ) size weight tremendous consideration . i leaning toward swiss gear patriot kensington bag even went so far purchase them online vendor local in-store pickup . i arrived store before order ready thought i'd look see what other bags store offer . that when i got look this bag ( saw it online , but couldn't find pictures inside bag so i hesitant ) . it exactly what i needed few nice surprises . first , other reviewers spot their reviews . this bag super lightweight , easy roll easy pick up ( either handle or shoulder strap ) when you need ( i pick it up when i climb stairs my classes ) . i love it more feminine looking bag . inside pockets main compartment ( though not rear compartment ) really pretty chocolate brown pinstripe liner ( okay , i like pretty things ) . zipper main compartment opens almost bottom sides bag , which makes accessing your things very simple . it padded compartment your computer rear bag elastic strap keep computer moving around too much . i easily access my 12 " powerbook , but it slightly tighter fit my 15.4 " macbook pro . also , top 2 inches mbp not protected padding so i use neoprene sleeve added protection . this makes bit more effortful remove laptop , but not annoyingly so . nice touch laptop compartment allows computer suspend slightly within bag so computer never touches bottom bag . main compartment also holds all my files class , well my textbook ( paperback ) small notebook . contrast backpack , i easily identify which files belong which class so i don't pull all my folders out everytime . there also room my power adapter my presentation remote case . rear compartment handy other computer accessories like cables , power adapter , umbrella . you see telescoping part handle this section it exposed . this didn't bother me first until i realized when i am rolling bag i actually see into this compartment when handle extended ( when stored there zipper covers handle ) . not much exposed , but if it raining i'll most likely carry bag or just make sure things compartment won't bothered little wetness ( don't let this distract you , bag it otherwise water resistant i don't see it huge problem ) . smaller zippered section lots little compartments pens , flash drive , ipod , other computer accessories . i also keep two glasses cases , my palm pilot wallet this section . i like this section opens up real wide some material sides so things don't fall out when you open it completely . smaller zippered compartment this outside this section great flat things like tissues , post-it notes , etc . top easy access zipper pocket super convenient too ! i keep my keys there ( though wish there key clip ) things like my phone , chapstick , lipstick small bottle lotion . it also great storing boarding pass bit cash when i travel . previously mentioned , this bag fits very easily under airline seats . strap back bag intended allow you place it over telescoping handle roller bag . strap not cover width bag might not fit over some handles . it works most standard ones , but hartmann bag i extra wide handle strap wasn't wide enough handle it . i use piggy-back system take these two trips together ( which makes easier rolling anyway ) . all all , this fabulous bag my needs . price here also excellent . i happy i paid $70 it listed amazon $92 though now it listed $57.89 ! you can't beat price ! i would not hesitate buy this bag again	1

after couple years heavy heavy use ( i travel quite bit through boats , planes , trains , automobiles ) , my old trusty e2cs conked out . they fantastic set headphones but i think i got right headset cord snagged one too many times passing objects . i went ahead upgraded e3gs ( i contemplate e4gs but couldn't justify myself extra $$$ yet ) . these purely replacement e2cs but i like design e3s e4s better ( i looked bit like alien pointy e2s i wonder whether they'd any sound difference . i didn't expect hear any sound difference e2cs e3gs but i . they just sounded richer , bit louder , fuller . soft plugs come them noticably more comfortable me . i always used silicone sleeves but now i'm using little gray ones it comes . overall , fantastic experience these . i mostly airplane travel these really isolate me noise gray foams aren't sensitive transmitting noise rustling cord like some older models . i own two bose headsets too ( older newer model ) . i like them but i always limited space when i travel overall , i think i get more isolation in-ear design shures but there advantages boses ( i prefer them intercontinental travel they're more comfortable over very long distances ) . they're very different headsets just fyi . i hesitated compare all but they headsets . i know these little in-ears either love em or hate them affair . sorry can't predict your particular experience hope i don't steer anyone wrong direction . they worked me i notice difference upgrade e2c e3gs . i wonder if there noticable difference e4gs ? maybe when these snag something one too many times , hopefully few years now .	1
i am sorry see negative reviews this board . i bose speakers more than thirty years . my first set , pair 601 still functioning friends house . my 901 series vi blow away any home theater systems i've heard . direct reflecting sound , there no need center channel , rear channel . you just get realism listening experience unmatched . i two sets acoustimas am-5 i am totally satisfied . i've one set since 1991 tribute quality longevity product . i purchased second set when i finished my basement they nothing short awesome . when i entertain , i almost always get compliment sound speakers . other reviewers commented lack bass . i would just say you really pay attention placement subwoofer . bose intends subwoofer use floor platform send bass throughout room . placing subwoofer nearer corner room sometimes increase bass . i both my systems set up subwoofer corner firing out 45 degree angle rooms totally filled deep rich bass . i always preached gospel putting your money good set speakers . while your other equipment important , speaker system make or break quality your sound . but any speaker system , you finesse placement optimal results .	1

i am par t-t ime musician am always looking something small portable record practices concerts . many years , i used wmd3 sony professional walkman but flipping tape every 45 minutes pain . advent digital technology , i got sharp mini-disc found it very useful . 80 minute discs great sound quality quite good . later , i got sony m1 professional dat . it very good , but i found built-in mic preamps disappointing , despite getting oade modification . recording time increased 2 hours . real drag now transferring recording real-time computer conversion . wav so i could make cds . i recently got r09 . it small very light , much lighter than my dat . it uses sd cards . 2gb sd card , costing $25 , record 3 hours music 44.1 khz ! it also record straight mp3 if you smaller card or need conserve space . best all , there no real-time transfer hassles . just plug card reader drag drop file computer . awesome ! nice thing r09 there variety input options . there mic input line input , there lot headroom input , making it difficult overdrive it . there low cut filter filter out rumble . mic input uses 1/8 " mini jacks supply plug-in power mics just like sony wmd3 pcm m1 . r09 also features built-in mics whose sensitivity adjusted ( high or low ) . during recent practice , i used built-in mics pleasently surprised superb quality recording . r09 gives me option use built-in mics if i don't want take my external mics . some people complained r09 take only up 2gb sd cards . this not true any more . roland recently released firmware 1.10 which allows r09 use new sdhc ( high capacity ) cards . there very reasonable priced 4gb ($50 ) 8gb ($100 ) cards available . r09 very easy use well . interface so intuitive i made my first recording played it back without ever look manual . display bit small , espcially this day age , but perhaps roland it conserve power . because line-in , it very easy now me now convert cassettes , minidiscs , or dats . wav without tie up my computer hours end . ability convert audio . wav without computer very handy . summary , r09 marks major paradigm shift portable recording devices . it now so easy tape lectures , concerts , practices , just anything almost immediately it available burning cd playback . roland r1 m-audio microtrack paved way , but this unit packs needed features ease use right price point . highly reccomended . if you shop around , you get r09 authorized dealer less than $350 , bargain price when you consider what it allows you	1

good : these headphones most comfortable wear i ever tried . they aren't too tight materails aren't too " sweaty " which nice . this important item me since i can't stand phones hurt or feel gross after used half-hour or so . they look great ! coolness factor very high . ear-coverage excellent . i big ol ' ears so this key -- they block out lot outside noise which good since i wear them lot server room . i don't crank tunes up too loud drown out noise . decent high mid-range sound . cool case which carry them around extra set pads nice . not-so-good : i agree few other reviewers lack bass . price , i would expect even better sound surely lot more bass . overall sound quality not bad , however i expected little more bang my buck . i get similar sound quality bit more bass my sony mdr-v150 1/4 price ( though coolness comfort factors aren't nearly high ) . i still like these headphones , but i am betting price there better quality phones found	-1

just got my super fi 5 pro i like them . i owned shure e3c etymotic er4-p . my girlfriend needed new phones , so i gave my shure e3cs bought etymotic . i recently left them inside rental car ( big bummer ) so i needed new pair decided see what else out there . etys amzing clairty high end nice mids . they fit beautifully very easy put triple flanged sleeves . only complaint i bass , while you could " experience " it aurally , you never really " felt " it . i like my bass . so what i read online , super fi would good alternative bit cheaper than replacing etys . after listening jazz , classical , some snoop , stone temple pilots , bass indeed impressive . mids nice , using ipod , you customize sound using ipod eq . i am not impressed highs ( not nearly defined crisp etys ) but highs still there . i am willing compromise bit high end get more bass . fit relatively straightforward stock medium rubber sleeves work fine , though double flange sleeves work , too . i like how easy etys put ( ues require you bit more adjusting you put them wrap wire around top your ear like most musicians ) but i'm sure it become second nature . overall , someone who owned high end earphones got degree music , i think super fi good value . get same bass even better treble , i think you'd need spend twice much playing compressed music ipod , i just don't think it worth it . these phones nice compromise	-1
digimemo 692 digital notepad made sense me several reasons ; 1 ) it cheap - $90 + or - small risk take new technology ; 2 ) if you use it technology fails , you left ultimate safe , low tech backup - ink notes paper 3 ) it lighter easier use when move ( walking through building taking notes , or sitting meeting where laptop would awkward instance ) . main question me how well handwriting recognition could made work . so far i am cautiously pleased . dm works advertised . unit light , pen comfortable hand , writing faithfully recorded .. image computer screen faithful representation page ( occasionally small strokes missed ) , software interface dumping pages pc acceptable - it could smoother but works without any glitches or major hassles . actually , i rarely used it , since most my uploading directly hwr recognition program ( more below ) . it surprisingly good recognizing tables tables/spreadsheets . me , this unit would largely useless without hwr . i found myscript surprisingly good job reading my scrawl ( it scrawl - my handwriting terrible , i often print more than write , but found it reads script well printing ) . if you write neatly whole process much easier . myscript particularly useful if you 1 ) use built training program ( helped some ) 2 ) create lists words ( " personal lexicon " ) shorthand conversions ( " auto replacements " ) . former good aid recognition specialized technical terms , names , etc . latter most useful feature , though . it you create entire shorthand ("" becomes " " " sy " becomes " sincerely yours " etc . ) . best all , i discovered undocumented feature . instead entering shorthands or lexicon words one time you simply open . txt file ( " autoreplacements . txt " " lexicon . txt " myscript folder ) enter these wholesale . i now hundreds . handwritten " wed td " top page comes out " wednesday list . " my old newton learned corrections , so it became increasingly accurate . myscript doesn't ( i asked - nice people who answer my emails told me it trickier implement than i suspect ) . people learn though , so what happens me - i'm sure most people - my own style adapts what system shown it recognize . people good continual improvement machines . this not ultimate system . paper size too small some uses ( unlike some reviewers , though , i found 6x9 pads easy find drug or office supply stores ) . it would nice if system video out and/or drawing table functionality . more expensive cyberpad takes 8.5 " 11 " paper serves tablet , i am told , acecad folks indicated next version digimemo ( " out soon " ) also . batteries really last long time ( 100 hours advertised seems right ) . it would nice if lcd screen clipboard more than show if page written or blank , but thast feels like niggling . this very good device but not all people or purposes . this not you if you need hwr but aren't willing spend time making it work . but ... if you hate taking out laptop meetings or classrooms , if you disorganized like your written notes together one place , if you need draw something shoot it off email ( ability connect mobile web this would killer app dm ) , if you need take notes while standing or walking don't want re-type them all , then this may great device you	-1

i really like this bag - i bought it use college , which i just recently started . it holds just everything i could possibly need , my laptop , my graphics tablet , my books , et cetera . this bag not without its flaws , however . previously stated many other reviews , there no place hold water bottle . flaw its design fact there so many small pockets ! these pockets can't hold more than few things , so you spread your small items throughout them , then when you need something forced hunt through half dozen tiny pockets filled small objects look your flash drive , or your keys , or tampon or whatever else you put there . one last flaw : because it so big , many students sympathise way too many books , bag easily get really heavy . one occasion , i dropped something so i leaned down pick it up , only unable get back up because my bag so heavy ! this probably not problem everyone better shape than i am , but extremely heavy bags tend bit inconvenience most people . overall , this bag really great . i like it , good outweighs minor inconveniences	-1

i owned previous version this monitor , 213t , 6 months completely happy it . only problem refresh rate bit slow ( i think around 16ms ) . but it wasn't so much problem since i didn't watch much video or play games it . otherwise color viewing angles fine . my other computer monitor i viewsonic 20 inch lcd , which i purchased because i needed fast refresh so i play games . i never liked this monitor though , it always problems recognizing it connection my pc color viewing angles not very good either . plus it weird viewing quality it , like i looking through screen door or something . so when i saw samsung updated 213t into 214t fast refresh something like 6ms , i decided replace viewsonic . i'm so happy i ! 214t bigger far superior monitor than viewsonic , definite improvement even 213t . great color quality , no ghosting while playing games or watching video , really wide viewing angle .	1

i currently use microsoft intellimouse i purchased 4-5 years ago . it most comfortable mouse medium large sized hands . bar none . microsoft kept it sweet simple they winner ! why they ever took this mouse off market , i'll never understand . after getting new pc recently , i decided " splurge " get one these ultra-ergonomic mice . i looked usual suspects : logitech , kensington , microsoft , etc . i disappointed feel fit various mice i tried weren't smooth intellimouse . then , lo behold , i noticed microsoft rereleased intellimouse . great , my search over ! i received mouse today . same design , same fit . awesome . only one problem you manufacturing geniuses ,... scroll wheel rattles unbelievably !!! how bad ? think those old-fashioned new year eve noisemakers you hold small handle twirl around circle . that sound it makes , i'm not kidding . original intellimouse scroll wheel very quiet when use . how could you screw this one up ?! it same product you offered few years ago color black now ! you somehow lose drawings original intellimouse scroll wheel ? you need save extra 50 cents it manufactured somewhere else ? what dealbreaker . i'm sticking my old intellimouse until microsoft gets clue fixes this oversight	-1

i am giving this unit lowest possible score reasons below . fact this product lexar actually named " secure " invokes belief it really secure . however , i discussing this lexar over two weeks now , without resolution . problem encrypted vault ( reason i purchased thing ) not available except when signed administrator . hello ??!! why would lexar build unit smaller than some earrings my girlfriend wears if they not expect it used portable device , meaning it would used many different computers ? so , if you go library , or work network , or your friend billy house , you not administrator , you lose ! only way around this put your most sensitive material right public drive , not use secure features drive . make sense ? i sent software version lexar no improvement , tried all their suggestions , now unit display microsoft windows error screen shut drive down . fair , if you not need access sensitive material any computer ( without admin rights ) then this unit could work you . it works great my home computer , but i just admit portable device i tend want port it around use it other machines cannot . if you need access your data many machines , wish so without admin rights , beware ! i suggest you look lexar website contact them make sure this possible . i'm still wrestling them , am hopeful i take them mat pin them , able actually use this storage device advertised .	-1

i bought this simple mount put magnavox 37mf 321 , 37-inch lcd tv wall , or more accurately , my new " entertainment center " i built into standard 4-inch sheet-rocked wall . my new entertainment center only requires two inches living room space , replacing crt tv entertainment center required over 26 inches valuable living room real estate ! this made big difference our 16x18 living room . while there few design features could probably improved , overall it proved up task . it mounts tv nice flat , there seems plenty lateral adjustment get screen level straight . i shorten few bolts hacksaw ; if making few minor alterations such this beyond your capabilities , you probably shouldn't doing this job yourself anyway . if possible get friend help hold tv , especially when making your cable connections tv just before hanging it . i actually managed this myself , but helper would very useful . if you looking fancy , tilt swivel mount lots features(which also stick out further wall ) , look elsewhere . if you just need simple mount hang your tv flat wall , this just thing . overall , inexpensive mount job	1
if it would only cost same sd micro card comparably size capacity , it would almost perfect , i say " almost " because i encountered minor flaw i don't really know if it phone or memory . some times , after viewed many times image it kinds corrupts file but not point image not viewable , but rather it mess up some pixels it or sometimes half image . i've seen this other memories digital cameras , but i can't sure who blame . it include memory stick pro duo adapter , but if you need use it ms reader ( larger original sony memory ) , you still need buy adapter convert ms duo plain ms but many new multi card readers ability use newer smaller ms duo pro , so included adapter enough	-1

these speakers really intended use surround speakers . i recently upgraded my 5.1 receiver onkyo 7.1 100 watts per channel . i've using klipsch speakers l/r center boston side surround my existing set-up . my home theater room not large , 13 20 . i thought it would nice add two rear speakers my existing surround set-up . i am professional musician movie buff . quality well versatility both critical my listening . my son ( also musician ) already uses bose 161s his surround set-up recommended them . i not disappointed . i tested them some my thx encoded dvds rear channel speakers they fit seamlessly . i can't testify performance these speakers primary speakers . some people used them this way apparent success , but bose really intend these surround speakers those budget or dealing limited space they ideal intended purpose . surround speakers i rate them 5 stars	1

this remote unreliable junk ... well ... let me rephrase ... remote itself fine but software controls it absolute garbage which causes remote completely freeze up least once day . if you kind person turns computer hour ... uses remote , shuts off you'll probably never problem . but users pvr software keep their machines up running 24x7 . i this piece work freezing up me least once day . after researching further , i found program computer controls remote goes into infinite loop state where it uses 100% processor . only way re-initialize remote restarting computer but if your computer currently recording something you'll end up corrupting show you recording . after research i found many others web same issue . i'm sure someone read this say " load new drivers idiot ! " ... believe me , i'm up-to-date most current drivers date this review ( feb/2007 ) . streamzap acknowledged problem prior versions driver but it still exists this day . just search internet see . [ ... ] you take my word it , or you take your chances . if streamzap replied even one multiple emails i sent asking help i would happy work them . but i think they know problem out there they don't want address problem . they see numerous postings all over internet other people like me same issue	-1
i waited while before submitting review give this unit good try . i already portable unit ( garmin ) but wanted in-dash unit my other car . time this unit twice much garmin but it also played dvds . i very disappointed once i got this unit which cost twice much portable more than most other units market . biggest disappointment he not guide you fraction well any portable units market . garmin take you right door address you put . this unit ( if it find address ) gets you there says " you arrived .. " . but where , which side street , which building etc . my garmin take me right my own front door this expensive unit gets me area then i am left figure out which building ( all unique addresses ) i am looking . detachable controls unit would make you feel you paid $200 unit . it feels like it mostly plastic it couldn't cost them very much make . radio unit i car prior great detachable unit its own carrying case - you get no such thing pioneer . i thought bit cheap pioneer not even include carrying case such expensive unit . interface unit awkward time consuming . when you put address it apparently searches both state washington ( where i live ) oregon . i called pioneer ask if i could just search washington since i didn't care addresses other states this time when i i could just put state . way , this regular feature portable units . pioneer tap dances around answer but bottom line - no . what you expect only unit market where you put over side road apply parking brakes multiple times before switching addresses . i would get into problems pioneer getting its map upgrades out . again , something i spoke them you should hear song dance they give . however , if only thing wrong paying twice much unit delivers half much portable units i would just complain pionner . save money . if you want good reliable gps unit look either portable units or one other brands in-dash ones . built-in dvd players you get one those put your car fraction price . remember you always take back one portable units but pioneer you put out extra $200 get it installed well so no real taking it back . i urge you shop carefully if you all looking purchasing this unit . positive note , it fun watch screen come out pop up you first turn it . but i am not sure price worth	-1

new ipod video u2 special edition simply brilliant . reason ? well , there more then just one solitary reason : first course , amazing ipod itself . 30 gb storage ( thats 10 more gigs then original ipod u2 se ) , you plenty room upload pictures , videos , music . video quality ipod crystal clear , everything you need make pleasureable viewing experience . however , if you given ipod minimal charge , expect battery life drop significantly while watching videos , movie viewing eats up battery life . course , itunes makes uploading multiple songs videos breeze ; perfect your average joe techie . screen itself given upgrade , larger cleaner screen . screen noticably bigger , creates better viewing current movie played . video ipod also slimmer then older versions ( 1g , 2g , 3g , course 4g ) although paper marginal difference(compared 4g ) , your hand you feel it thinner robust body . headphone jack switched different position , posing troubles your pre-5g accessories . if you accessories you really need , i recommend keeping your older ipod , or consult someone see if location work out . outside box appearance also greatly slimmed down all videos , making it easy take around or great show off tight corners . lackluster accessories included ipod(a dock connecter , usb cable , headphones ) pose disappointment , majority users want wall charger , which included prior versions ipod . however , you may purchase one apple $29.00 . specs nice , but what really makes this one really special ... appearanceapple finally released u2 version ipod video , which , my opinion , beautiful move . u2 se stands out beautifully other 5g ipods ( black white ) , prominent red click wheel dabbed right center . yes , click wheel smallest version yet , regardless it same slick red finish . front finish ipod beautiful more glossy black used gather much more gleam then its older 4g model . front side also less likely gather scratches compared 4th . however , black finish means scratches inevitable , so i highly recommend use some type protection . finally , unlike its predecessor , 5g u2 se giving ultra-nice touch ; black chrome finish backside . this one simple touch utterly amazing , each band members signature shown crisply . compared chrome finish 4g u2 , signatures easily seen perfectly distinguishable . black rear finish also gives more protection minor scratches , which would , overtime , destroy appearance older ipod itself . however black finish hide most small scratches , yet , once again , case needed . closing : finishing note , this best looking ipod ever assembled . small touches make this more distinguishable garner more head turns . ipod also recieve less scratches , which great thing , my old 4g u2 got mutilated matter days . this must buy , regardless if you want stick out , or if you huge u2 fan . package comes certificate free 30 minute documentary u2 , which good deal , we get least one thing free(the older u2 se only came packaged certificate giving us 50 dollars off itunes definitive collection , priced around 250 . ) all all , great buy , if you think it , its not pricey ; only 20 dollars more overall better looking ipod sticks out , more value . also two more tid-bits : charge ipod ; oh yea , when you dont need it , turn off your backlight , it saves lot battery life , majority battery sucking comes light itself . pros : -amazing playback , crystal clear sound-beautiful display , vibrant color both movies photos . -excellent finish , black chrome rear , more glossy black front . -the great click wheel , which still maintains perfect control(regardless toned down size ) . -great movie playback-perfect interface itunes , giving addition music video playing breeze . cons : -more easily scratched compared white ipod . -battery life tends mind its own , going quick die-out , long lasting . -again , battery life seems too dull , die out quickly if not given full charge . -video playback desperately cut into battery life . -for first timers , there no manual included , so optional use tex t-t ype maybe required . -no wall charger/lackluster accessories	1
there awful lot reviews out web kvm switches . usually , more information good , right ? this case , i found so many contrasting opinions any given switch or company i banging my head against desk just trying decide what buy . usually , head-banging doesn't start until equipment received setup begins . this case , i found most head-banging evidently paid up front . i got box , hooked it up two computers ( third way , if changes anything , i'll try repost ) , turned computers . nobody happy anything . first computer didn't seem like display second didn't seem like keyboard or mouse . ( obviously , i couldn't tell whether first liked keyboard or mouse . ) three keyboard lights stuck num , caps , scroll lock , no matter which system kvm focus . note both systems verified working alone monitor , keyboard , mouse , prior my receiving kvm switch . i tried disconnecting mouse keyboard individually switch plugging them back . no effect . i power cycled " visible " computer , no effect . i powered both down , powered both back up , now everything seems fine . don't ask me -- i'm trying not believe gremlins or voodoo . possibly ( ir)relevant detail : when things started working , i realized i powered up first , let it complete boot cycle , then powered up second . it may kvm switch unable convince two machines simultaneously booting everything connected , although this pure speculation my part . i'll probably stick this sequence future ( no , voodoo , no ! ) because i like watch boot sequences . yeah , i'm nerd . system specifics :o system 1 : ( originally non-displaying system ) gateway g6-350 , running windows 98o system 2 : dell precision 330 , running windows 2000 proo monitor : gateway ev700 . curiously , this monitor shipped system 1 , which made initial display problem even more puzzling . o keyboard : standard ps/2 keyboard shipped gatewayo mouse : microsoft wheelmouse optical ( 2-button ) . this usb mouse came adaptor insertion into ps/2 port . i bought it last week because dell didn't recognize wheel behavior original gateway mouse . software came mouse installed gateway , but not dell , oversight . no biggie -- everything i need mouse , it . minor feature complaints :o noted here other sites , layout switch , outputs two long sides , makes bit octopus . if you want access switch , change systems without using hot keys , this might annoy you . o there only one button switch , so you cycle among all ports every time you want change active systems . not only this even more annoying when i hook up my third system , it just plain annoying switch isn't smart enough only switch connected ports . however , hot key functionality makes up this some degree . o ports " numbered " internally such 1 3 one side , 2 4 other . this seems bit bone-headed . o ports not visibly numbered box ( least i noticed , if they labeled , then labels should more obvious)conclusion : i bought this switch because it seemed good combination price features . amazon markdown almost scarily good ; i hoped it meant iogear come out something new , everybody just wanted clear inventory . my research indicated iogear , d-link , linksys usually rated mostly okay users , belkin somewhat below , other , cheaper models not often discussed . aten avocent lines seemed positively reviewed , especially online magazines like , but you're talking big price bump ( they usually eight-port switches ) . i would liked better switching , better cable routing , on-screen display , but these weren't deal breakers -- i knew what i trading off save money . hot key sequence change systems not annoying me -- regular emacs user , i'm used " chording " -- but it may , others . so . . . so far , so good . knocking wood , not because i believe voodoo or gremlins , but because i'm irish , that what we	-1

friend mine i bought printer each same day local aafes powerzone here germany ... he bought kodak printer dock series 3 ( not " plus " one ) i bought selphy cp710 . when we went home , he took pic his kodak camera ( which why he bought kodak dock ) . we printed pic both printers ( i used sd slot selphy print ) , they came out very crisp clear . i personally wouldn't able tell difference these prints something developer . now printers , they both printed image very sharp . almost can't tell difference them except blacks kodak darker , but it not like it horrible selphy . lcd only really useful selphy see images stored card , which you can't kodak ( since it doesn't screen ) ... it too small see any detail since image printed only takes up 2/3 already limited space . anyway , i am very impressed pictures these turn out , plus if you look around , you get cost per picture down 20 cents if you buy 108 sheet/ribbon set . definitely must buy my book	1

when i first discovered this portable dvd player , i impressed how much it met both my normal oddball demands . however , after some time , i gradually became less satisfied it than i first month i it . first foremost , its internal speaker volume somewhat weak , even when volume control set maximum possible level , i prefer not deal hastle headphone wire . my second gripe this model it not play mp3s recorded dvd . dvd5 single-layer discs hold six times standard cd , it unfortunate this model cannot play hours mp3 files recorded 320 kbps constant bit rate , highest quality mp3 file format date . ( please click ' comments ' let us know if incorrect . ) none philips portable dvd players currently play dts audio tracks . if i am road , yet want higher sound quality than dvd standard dolby digital audio track , this feature i miss , but only slightly because only four my most frequently played dvds use dts audio track . i decided send this unit out philips because its finish breaking off speakers arrow keys . this unit made multi-region compatible . disk door open , power up set while holding down osd . when menu appears , change region ' 0 . ' power off set close disc door . its pal-to-ntsc conversion leaves little bit desired if connected tv set . i recently upgraded philips pet724 7 " model . it larger , yet mannageable . it only runs approximately $20 more , but most all , it much better performer than this model . however , if you absolutely cannot dig up extra cash and/or make extra room your briefcase , it not like you purchased total lemon portable dvd player because two good things this model going it ultracompactness stable disc mechanism , so least you this product years come	-1

wow , this case outstanding video ipod . my wife i gone through 2-3 different cases ( we each own 80gb edition ) . this belkin case looks great simply awesome . it comes two pieces ( back plastic front " brushed metal ) snap together securely offers total protection unit ( screen wheel ) . we even dropped ours couple times , without any damage case or ipod itself . plus , case looks very high quality . belkin includes covers both 80 gb 30 gb versions box . ( 80 gb ipods much thicker than 30 gb ones . ) only issue some fm transmitters car docks won't plug into bottom slot ipod when this case used . i also noticed some cord splitters too big fit audio port case . if you only plan use ipod standard charger/cable earphones , this never problem . if you use it heavily car adaptors or docks , you might want consider different case	1

really , it hard go wrong when purchasing lcd tv . just look something hd , least 800:1 contrast ratio 8 msec refresh rate cheap possible . this very good tv , very good picture , very low price . only major downside this tv only 720p or 1080i , instead 1080p . 720p 1080i fine most applications , including hdtv . but if you want look future , you might want 1080p tv . newer hd dvd systems ( blue ray hddvd ) play station 3 require 1080p best picture . personally , i don't think hd dvd really take off ( but i could wrong ) i am not going get play station 3 , but i would still get 1080p tv , just case . however , i don't think you find 1080p lcd tv anywhere close this price range . other minor downside this tv it little confusing setup . it comes sheet quick setup instructions , but there no paper owners manual . owners manual cd , or you go online view i t.t he default mode this tv normal antenna connection you would use cable tv disabled . so , you go through menus tv figure out how enable antenna hookup . after , you instruct tv channel search , both analog digital . tv comes astc tuner , so you get hd channels off air ( free ) . however , getting hd channels off air difficult . if you get poor reception your area , then you won't able get hd channels . locking hd channels more difficult than old analog channels . if you don't rooftop antenna you house , then you need get rabbit ears . then it like back 1960 screwing around antenna placement get signal . i get best signal old rabbit ears my kids broke off , touching them wrought iron stand . i thinking bringing out aluminum foil . tv also qom tuner , so you get hd channels directly off cable , without getting special cable box . most cable systems , you pick up all local hd stations they offer basic cable ( bay area , it only 5 12 local stations ) . you pick up espn hd if you expanded basic service . only thing you can't get premium channels like hbo . hbo hd you still need cablebox . most lcd tv you get right now , default setup picture quality not optimally set up . this especially true standard analog tv . when you first hook up lcd tv , picture look pretty bad . you need go adjust color , contrast other settings get best picture quality . although defaults olevia better than some others i seen . although syntax olevia relatively new names they recognized one leaders lcd tv . it hard go wrong this tv . end , i recommend choosing size tv you need , deciding if you really need 1080p , then buying cheapest tv you find .	-1

i little skeptical when buying this mouse .. i wasnt sure whether or not i would like colors , or just really annoyed , but i say , its pretty cool little mouse . colors very vibrant ( i'm going post some pictures ) but not too bright where it distract user . it retractable mouse , cord quite short , so desktop useage limited many people , but its perefect laptop if you want something big enough actually able use , but small enough store easily carrying case . mouse moves pretty fast across screen without great deal movement . some people like this , some dont . personally , i like it better than my desktop mouse , which needs great deal movement get it across screen . its good laptop users limited area move mouse . overall , i would say this great mouse buy , especially kid , but adults enjoy it too	-1
i've using this radio few days now really like it . it above average . forget guy says it cheap knobs , plastic case , etc . it really feel sturdy , good selectivity pulls distant stations well . only drawback i wish this radio would some sort memory selected stations . but i easily find my favorites manually . it lot fun quality evident . i would definitely recommend it based price/quality . plus lacking most radios this type big speaker . most short wave radios tiny speaker which really bad . i don't know why they this ??? i would gladly pay more money bigger speaker some sound it .	-1

this one most expensive electronic purchases i ever made but it worth it !!! i don't know why so many people problems . i receive software update last summer repaired weird glitch remote controlling my tivo/directv receiver , but that it . bose very helpful over phone . this system beats any 5-6 speaker system i ever owned but i don't recommend it large room because you depend speakers bouncing off walls since there no rears . i don't know why so many people say it won't play their discs . mine plays everyting dvds cdrs even bootleg dvds !!! maybe they should call bose get free software upgrade . here bit advice before purchasing anything this expensive : go bose outlet store , best buy or sears listen it before you buy it ! i bought mine november 2004 1700.00 best buy when it still new , now it dropped almost half price almost 2 years . shame you bose	1

there still lot love s350 , big full sound , incredible fm reception , generally strong am reception , good rugged looks . but drift minor annoyance . worse , two am stations here los angeles , 1150 980 ( dodgers baseball ) , get overcrowding , meaning two stations playing once , no matter how narrow filter i get this overcrowding . my 40-dollar ge superradio iii doesn't this problem . but ge doesn't digital readout i hate finding sweet spot . so there big digital radio doesn't these flaws ? i hear there . soon there radio available called redsun 3000 , designed same maker grundig s350 ( called tecsun bcl 2000 china ) , which supposed blow away all competition . already redsun 2100 said superior 350 but ergonomic problems . 9-22-06 , redsun 3000 supposed only few months away . until redsun 3000 arrives , you may want look $99 sonido ( made sangean ) . it boasts presets , digital tuning , adds its fm/am tv band , but no shortwave . final point : if you're buying radio your office you use computer , i suggest you get good table radio remote control , like sangean wr-2 or its big brother sangean hdr-1 , high-definition radio . i point this out because any radio i've used within five feet my computer suffers horrible interference . place wr-2 ($159 ) or hdr-1 ($199 after rebate ) shelf or cabinet six feet away or so use your remote toggle preset stations . my experience these remote-control-operated radios well suited computer environments . update 12-31-06 : i've able get rid overcrowding am station 980 turning down am/sw rf gain knob . so i give fifth star s350	-1

i purchased this 3 months ago i absolutely love it . i bought it use my darkroom which small space it perfect . i am really big stereo systems . i don't think it worth listening music if it doesn't sound good . when i thinking getting speaker system i lot research , when i decided go this one i wasn't expecting too much . but i blown away sound , it definitly goes lot louder than i expected . now granted it isn't best but size price i can't complain . there however two things i would change it . base sound , it just doesn't sound way i like but you can't expect too much portable speaker system , i think it would better if they put seaking buttons machine , its fine if you remote you but if its not around then you navigate ipod itself which gets little annoying	1

after bought sony kdl46xbr2 set our primary tv , we wanted smaller high quality set bedroom . however , my wife unhappy mute function sony . this toshiba ( or without dvd player ) seems only one market mute feature my wife wanted . specifically , when mute button pressed , closed captioning ( visual writing spoken word appears ) although it takes two ( 2 ) presses because first press only partial mute lowering volume . when muted , press mute button clears writing audio resumes . sony -- apparently virtually all other current hd lcd tvs market -- require one go through menu turn closed captioning then turn it off , unless one wants both sound closed captioning when mute returned audible . feature my wife likes ability surf return original channel . one " lock " channel viewed , then surf multiple channels return original one click . only real fault i find instruction manual . it not sequentially go through each menu item , but skips back forth . i also think sound level lower than sony , but this most likely relative i set it higher numerical level , but percentage sound level bar , two appear same . other reasons difference may relate room acoustics , location , etc . i " issues " both sets although they imply set chooses correct image format - labeled " normal " , theater 1 " , " theater 2 " , " theater 3 " " full " this set " normal " , zoom " , " full zoom " " wide zoom " sony - neither one seems work . making changes sony easier there one button so directly ; toshiba , one must access menu	-1

i like receiver just fine , except fact i can't find universal remote code it my remote recognize . ( why can't they just publish code manual , right ?! ) unit really nice looking i love fact you dim very loud blue lighting front . however , you can't dim blue light power switch , which kind silly since other lights front panel dim very nicely . frankly , i don't like staring bright blue light while i'm trying watch tv . but i wanted write this review mainly thank amazon jr electronics amazing delivery service . amazon offered free shipping if i selected standard shipping speed which fine , so i expecting product arrive six days . but , i received email jr 2:45 am after day i ordered , saying box shipped , it arrived 10am day !!! they shipped it * overnight * me ups no charge . this really good service . thanks	-1
i can't tell you what you might want buy , but it shouldn't this unit . i've unable depend it since day i got it . i'm quite technical , managed tech support geeks several years , but this contraption tried my patience . it worked sporadically few weeks , sometimes good signal strength , but mostly weak one . well , okay , pc used wireless building our house , so i willing give it benefit my doubt . then i brought pc into same room wap tried tweak fiddle settings both wap pc , hoping zip up speed make connection more reliable . i couldn't even get connected point . updated firmware latest . reset everything factory defaults , then painstakingly entered wpa2 key ssid , plus admin password , all other things like allowed mac addresses , etc . okay , so now i see network my pc but i can't connect . then after few more connection tries , i couldn't even see network , nothing , nada , no dice . so i've gone downhill , sporadic usually slow connection building ... not even seeing wireless network while i'm literally sitting next wap . that it , i give up . i've wasted least 50 hours this device , it definitely not worth money . i bought this because i already own industrial-strength firewall/router didn't need router . maybe that where i went wrong , don't you same thing ! stay away this money time waster	-1

i bought one these units march 2006 response my wife constantly changing room arrangements , subsequently requiring tv work area didn't easy cable access . i looked several units other manufacturers , actually bought one try best buy , which leapfrog , i think . testing unit convinced me concept sound , i would kept unit except it operated 2.4 ghz , which caused interference every time microwave use , or telephone rang . my computer hard wired into network i don't want deal increased security requirements wireless , my phones work fine 2.4 ghz , so i looking solution , but 5.8 ghz . i called rf-link tech support , got all my questions answered placed order through amazon . product worked flawlessly six months then crapped out . crapping out , i mean when unit enclosed space where there exessive heat buildup , unit would stop working after 10 minutes . i contacted rf-link tech support , they promptly sent out replacement unit , explaining motherboard completely redesigned , therefore they sent me new units well new power supplies . replacement units worked flawlessly . although i upset go through return/rma process delay using product until thr replacement received , everything fine now . i would recommend this product anyone who doesn't want expense paying install cable outlets everywhere . those who concerned 5.8 ghz interference , phones , 6.0 ghz phones already available , so no future compatability issues there either	-1

i love these headphones . i use them night bed when my girlfriend sleeping she doesn't hear thing . sound surprisingly great headphones very comfortable . line sight flexible - so you off side still reception . headphones don't look or feel cheap , not too heavy transmitter base looks really sleek . batteries last long time before recharging all you turn them put them they turn off soon you take them off - very cool feature . price great too considering quality features - shop around you'll find better prices . extra features these headphones i use occasion because they work best specific content : srs surround sound works great digital music movies feature surround sound . vibration " rumble " function works great dance hip-hop music , movies lots sound effects explosions ( like stars wars ) video games . one note : sound good source . reduce background hiss - turn up source audio not headphones volume . meaning , if its connected your stereo or tv - it work sort amp , so turn up volume there first before raising volume too high headphones . i no problems background hiss . pros : - sound great ( clear , loud , good bass treble)- comfortable- infrared = no tuning or inteference ( within line sight)- srs surround sound bass vibration function ( nice extras)- easy on/offcons : - infrared short range- line sight ( lose signal quality if base view obstructed)- kinda bulky looking ( looks aren't everyone)overall : price , features , quality sound looks there no better choice if you're looking short-range wireless headphones	1

i researched many dlp projectors , before buying this one . i believe i got best bang buck . it very versatile product . i am using it both home theater portable projector videos slideshows . positives : 1 ) price , good price 1024 768 native resolution . 2 ) 2500:1 contrast ratio , one highest this price range . 3 ) 2000:1 lumens , i play it bare , flat white wall , it looks clear crisp any movie theater , can't wait get my " screen goo " paint , my wall . 4 ) operation noise , fairly quiet normal mode , economy mode it ultra quiet , can't hear projector all . 5 ) keystone works great . i my projector behind me shelf , near ceiling , it creates angle projection . keystone flattens out picture , so it looks like it should . negatives : not many but , few minor annoyances . 1 ) adjustment arm it not centered . why , i don't know . ceiling mount , it would no consequence . 2 ) lens cap , everytime i remove it , i refocus , minor detail . 3 ) it composite video , s-video , but you buy adapter component video . right now my component video adapter back order . however , i am using s-video , am very happy clearity my movies . i doubt if i could tell much difference component cables but , would like see . summary ; i paid less than $800 it , delivered my door . i play it 96 " diagonal . you cannot buy new plasma , dlp , or lcd tv , this size screen , price . i don't believe giving 5-stars product , unless it ultimate , every way . so , few minor annoyances , i give this projector strong 4-star rating .	-1
i am big fan ergonomic keyboards . you know ones split keys . my wrists hurt times typing work . well , i say i've using this keyboard week without wrist pain . i think flat design helps my wrists i no longer need wrist supports . my wrists flat desk keyboard . so helps awful lo t.t his comes all batteries you'll need get started . mouse recharge . keyboard won't . keyboard needs 4 aa batteries . so far , i no idea when it going die but i keep spare batteries case . feel keyboard more like laptop keyboard than traditional keyboard . there very little down stroke when you press key . no too springy either . function keys top not really keys but small depression you lightly touch . took some getting used . i'm not 100% sold design . i use arrow keys lot my work they're much smaller than most old keyboards i've used . there times where i've thought returning old keyboard just because . but i still like feel enough give this chance . mouse works fine . it mouse . it no logitech laser mx but it not bad . action fine . it nice keyboard mouse drive off one little bluetooth usb key . overall , i'd recommend this few reservations . if you're super sensative ergonomic keyboards don't like regular keyboards , avoid this . also , if you need 10 key or use arrow keys lot , this not keyboard you . beyond , you've got stylish cool keyboard good mouse	-1
my setup includes home-built windows xp intel mainboard power mac g5 , both fully updated . i'm using usb mac keyboard sony dvi monitor . everything worked flawlessly . manual isn't bad , but could better . i can't help wondering if some dissatisfied users haven't failed read manual closely , thereby missing detail or two . beyond plugging cables , little setup required . i make setup change accomodate mac keyboard . default , ports configured auto-detect keyboard types when connecting windows pcs . mappings keyboard types enable you enter any keystroke either type keyboard . example , my mac apple key executes windows menu keystroke when windows pc selected . only thing i'd love see switching optical audio . i 5.1 speaker system , i switch inputs systems manually . 2-channel audio switching works fine , however , that all specs promise . unit includes cable upgrading firmware . since mine works fine , i haven't looked see whether any upgrades available , but those who problems might check . i've worked several kvm switches over years . i very impressed this one . it compact , reasonably priced , includes required cables , worked well out box . i recommend it highly	1

i suspect lot negative reviews people axe grind blu-ray vs . hd-dvd battle . however , it now looking likely there no battle , most studios announcing intentions release movies all 3 formats . what made me take plunge netflix now offering good range both hd-dvd blu-ray discs . picture quality this player simply amazing , almost cinematic quality . uncompressed 5.1 channel output sounds great too . even standard dolby digital seems sound better than my old player . player very well built quite cool looking . it seem like current releases even better picture than early ones - like copy fifth element bundled player , this looks slightly lower quality than , example , babel ( just released ) . negative side , what most people referring long load time fact , boot up time . switch boot up player takes 25s . once booted load time movie fairly normal . i don't see boot up time big problem . nitpicking aside , once you've watched couple blu-ray movies you won't want go back dvd	1

i purchased this software more it street mapping detail than topographic mapping . living out here rural ky i yet find backroad or country highway isn't accurately mapped this software . even local bb , restaurants , filling stations poi ( points interest ) database . simply amazing . you easily define waypoints build routes . if you plan any kind road navigation your magellan handheld gps but also want additional features topographic mapping then this software get . i mention version 1.0 appears pre-date explorist series because there no built-in support direct download explorist . it takes extra step using magellan conversion manager software load regions into your explorist . not difficult all . 3d view option somewhat useless , it often not depict physical world closely enough meanigful . ability select regions downloading gps seems limited rectangular selections only . this works well enough most cases but irregularly shaped terrain it causes you select lot more area than you really want , which consumes more gps memory . maybe this limitation how mapping software works but freeform selection tool would nice addition . aware converting regions download takes lot computing power memory ! converting entire state like ky takes several minutes my 3ghz computer results 55mb download file ! overall this product well worth price	1

first all , i see there bit controversy out here hiss , whether sub worth money . i hope clarify this simple terms . begin , i audiophile quality system . conrad johnson , tandberg , nad , celestion components , yet moved into new home , i didn't want see all those components speakers my living room new wood floors . i hoped this system sub would fit bill , but rather skeptical , after reading reviews here . so here my vote . get model 2 , get sub . it all worth it , but you'll never " hear " it , until it set up properly . first off , i'm ham ; anyone tell you , you're only good your antenna . i used roof mount full size fm antenna my baseline reference , but didn't want it my roof . i replaced it quite nicely radio shack 15-1859 $24.99 . however , like speakers , placement everything . i put headphones tuned it difficult station , then moved antenna until it clear , so i could move free unit without front speakers listen . wa-la .. after few minutes testing , i attained absolutely noisless signal it ; perfect spacial seperation . next , i found speaker placement very critical set proper soundstage , get " it intended heard " seperation . i buy sub , but now , leave it turned off . also , don't rely leaving balance centered . i tweak it , so don't afraid . try putting some andres segovia keep adjusting balance until you hear " open ambiance " auditorium he played . listen attain spacial result . then you're set . now turn your sub . also , those who say sub isn't needed . fooey . it well worth money , provides third leg triangle truly present what this system . once all set , knock yourself out . it no brainer , yes , again ; sub " required " well worth it . references what this system , try patrick o'hearn/metaphor , andreas vollenweider/book roses , tower power/soul vaccination ( live ) . they let you hear what this baby . kinda like driving porsche straight road 40 mph , saying " it not hot " . context everything . hope this helped . again , what i found necessary , signal quality , speaker placement/balance adjustment , without sub ; then sub added . me , this system keeper , keep my former audio system packed away now . me , unobtrusiveness ; " invisible " components , " coming out ? " performance , coming out top , winning big . go it . it rare find , great value	1

if you buy it , you'll spending forty bucks stand no features zune doesn't already provide ( sync cable output , headphone jack , that it ) . this might worth buying if it came speakers ( you'd think zune would want provide accessories compete ipod instead making ipod look so much better ! ) . i suppose if you want waste more money buy remote ( sold separately ) , it might worth paying twenty bucks dock , but definitely not forty or whatever discount amazon might give	-1

how many pictures it store ? it most commonly asked question digital camera enthusiast but usually question most difficult get straight answer . well , considering i worked memory industry over 7 years i help clarify this perplexing question so unbiased i since changed industries . fujifilm 64mb xd card , like most 64mb cards , store average 71 pictures when used 2 megapixel camera , 53 images when used 3 megapixel camera , 32 pictures when used 4 megapixel camera , 25 images when used 5 megapixel camera , 20 pictures when used 6 megapixel camera . these numbers based off assumption you going shoot your images highest quality jpeg setting available camera understand they estimates may off much 10 percent due numerous factors including complexity scene shot compression algorithm used your specific camera . i truly hope this review helpful you determining whether this card right capacity your specific needs	1

i'm really happy a/v pack , it works exactly advertised . my only gripe , reason why i only give it four stars , sync cable it comes no longer than your standard sync cable , meaning you set you dock fairly close your power supply . but something should mentioned all official zune accessories i've used so far very high fit finish , dock no exception far more heft than it first appears . tiny details built into accessories just fantastic like , this case , magnetic remote ... brilliant	-1

casio kept true form this one . everything works we expect it , unlike my first databank watch , it light . word " light " rubbing out after this thing few years , i've replace resin band . aside , i get great battery life turning little beep feature off , sparingly using alarm , light . however , like all casio digital watches , this one always seems get ahead 30 seconds . so , you want reset time every month or so . i reset mine 30 seconds behind because i think it levels off some point . data not get lost when battery changed . calander display nice because you know glance something coming up this week , or next . pc-link , enhanced display , better band would make this definate 5 star product . color oled display would rock . let world their slips paper , notes books , fancy schmancy pda . this everything i actually need it	-1

sony portable minidisc piece pure digital craftsmanship . i recently bought one store i believe this best things i ever bought . it weighs 4 ounces very compact . each disc store five hours music . best thing this player it records its own music . mini disc inside protective case so it makes it virtually impossible scratch i t.t he cd-rom comes player two different programs it use . first one called md simple burner this allows you burn straight your player without any delay . software finds names song burns name artist , album , individual track . simple burner also lets you put songs its own group name entire disc including each group . second program sonic stage takes it step further . person personalize name each song such " my favorite ' or give it dates when song actually came out . sonic stage lets you keep media library , buy download music many other things . this only program i know would let you remove certain songs without erasing entire disc . i would recommend this line players any person run most day but really enjoys their music . if you not totally , computer savvy this you . it truly worth cost . phillip alexander	-1

i bought this item because amazon never 3m model i wanted stock . so i settled this one . big mistake . wheels this stand only 8 inches apart which makes your cpu very unstable . spring steel friction fit makes it difficult one person attach or remove this stand cpu . it really two person operation . finally , if your cpu side access panel , you remove it stand gain access since stand uses pressure fit hold it computer . take look 3m cs100 stand . i think it much better design	-1

i've this phone approx . 9 months now , maybe longer ... i truly don't know how i've stood using this dual phone system so long . however , tonight i've taken giant step " upward " towards better quality design panasonic kx-tg 5432m dual system . this dual handset worst i've ever experienced cordless system . moment i set it up , static atrocious . step away base unit over ten feet it sounds like someone gargling gravel or mad cat hissing your ear . i can't even step into my attached garage talk someone without major static point not even able heard other person . even within six feet base i receive intermittent static becomes obnoxious distracting , not only me , but other person other end ... they hear it too . i never purchase uniden product , if this non-quality product they put out . i 2.4 mhz system would outshine this system ... i wish i'd never gotten rid it . title says ... if you desire lot static when you talk phone , this system you need bring crackling symphony music your ear . melodic consistancy this system creates ones enjoyment talking phone not put you sleep , but rather increase your aggravation dealing what sounds like major electrical storm going inside your head . uniden should ashamed this product . stepping down soapbox now ..	-1
i owned dmr-es40v over 6 months . it combo dvd/vcr unit . i sufficient time become intimately familiar pros cons unit . manual : it imperative manual . this machine somewhat complicated , frequent trips instructions necessary . if everything working correctly , you usually find instructions you need somewhere it . it overly time-consuming though , since items don't seem logically flow . if you dig long hard enough though , they there somewhere . set-up : somewhat experienced setting-up home theater , this generally easy . text pictures sufficient . searching through function menu , i learned perform same action different levels required using different imput buttons . this needlessly confusing . course auto clock set function isn't very accurate ( i haven't seen accurate one yet ) . dvd playback : general playback pretty straight-forward . i really miss some extra playback features my jvc progressive player ( which 3 years older ) . finding scene movie comparatively difficult . zoom feature missing . many convenience features not present . dvd recording : recording onto dvd-ram disc dream compared old fashioned vcr tapes . i really enjoy using them . quirk -- you must unit stand-by record scheduler . this mandates watch recorded show while recording another(on same disc ) you must wait until unit begins recording , then select show watch navigator . uhf tuner some trouble recording somewhat weak signals channel 19 . other weak channels record but not 19 . this problem started 6 months after initial set-up . there annoying bug daylight savings time , newer extended time period . panasonic web site suggests going into set-up menu unchecking dst box ; thus removing feature . if this anything , it would allow you set clock manually . without automatic dst adjustment would not annoying , but even though you turn-off this feature it still resets your clock twice day noon 7pm est . this ruins any tv scheduling you set . this malady persisted until date former dst spring-ahead arrived . several weeks scheduling hell ! i requested assistance customer service but never received telephone call promised . no message , no number call -- just promise call again when i home . vcr use : this feature really buggy . you supposed able eject cassette remote ; but this only worked month or two . when tv show scheduled recording unit won't tape it if you merely insert cassette . it doesn't recognize insertion cassette unless tape made move -- either playing little or fast forwarding/reversing . this really annoying . last impression : last movie ( last king scotland ) i watched took over machine . remote control would not function , disc would not stop , disc could not ejected . it necessary unplug unit , restart it , eject disc , totally reset all menu items -- which randomly reset various settings . worse some settings no longer selectable . one other movie would not even play machine -- forcing me use trusty jvc unit . i must say this machine many same problems still occurring new units what i read this forum other ones . these units released sale way before they ready public consumption . i recommend looking elsewhere .	-1
specs look good . hdmi 1.3 , 1080p , firmware upgrade over ethernet , etc . unit seems solid ( heavy ) well built . however , toshiba chose ship this hd-dvd player only composite a/v cable ( yellow , red , white rca jacks ) box . best resolution you get this cable 480i , not even good s-video connection ! it pretty amazing high-end consumer electronics device which advertised its high-definition capabilities hdmi 1.3 interface shipped without cable set ( component video or hdmi ) actually makes it possible customer connect it hdtv . i don't know how much cost savings toshiba gets out not including cable costs less than $5 . now let get real review : pros : - one best features this unit its capability upscale regular dvds 1080p . upscaling very high quality . unit also various noise reduction options help some poorly mastered dvds . - if weight unit any indication , build quality high . - it ethernet port firmware updates ( possible future functionality)cons : - very slow boot time . takes longer boot than my windows xp pc . - especially durimg 1080p hd-dvd playback , unit gets very hot . make sure your enclosure/rack open back . there somewhat loud fan unit back player . - this player no zoom/scaling functions dealing non-anomorphic dvds , so you use your tvs scaling function . kind pain since image quality suffers when video go through two parallel scalers	-1

i my research before purchasing this wireless card amazon use conjunction my belkin pre-n wireless router . according every net review i'd read , this combination belkin pre-n desktop card router best range throughput range than any other card/router its class , my workstation out middle farm almost impossible distance router , ' range ' what i needed above all . after some configuration finding best spot put computer itself , i now regularly connection qualities 77-90% range good 200-300 ft . my router which building entirely ( both lot metal cladding what-not i expected cause great deal interference if not outright unworkability . ) odd thing this ' pre-n ' combination belkin apparently later belkin equipment grossly inferior , manages pull off only half range this model . these cards pre-n router becoming harder find they've superseded newer ( inferior ) models currently stores , so if you operate wireless great distances , i doubt you'll beat these belkin models least immediate future	1

things i like : ( 1 ) option tile front keyboard up makes typing much more comfortable . i skeptic it before i purchased it , but really like it . also , this first keyboard i used allows so many typing angles . ( 2 ) included software gives great deal control over customizing all extra keys keyboard . even if you don't windows vista , you program gadgets key suit your needs . ( 3 ) keyboard no lag me , whatsoever . ( 4 ) i'm big fan standard 3x2 key setup home keys , etc . ( 5 ) this small change , but i'm using this setup dell inspiron 6000 laptop . software replaced large volume notifications ( onscreen display showing volume level , mute , etc . ) smaller more attractive style notification . me gusta . ( 6 ) curved keyboard also comfortable . it requires no time nor effort getting used it . ( 7 ) i haven't any problems keyboard " out range . " ( 8 ) mouse , i'm switching wireless intellimouse explorer 3.0 , which also made microsoft , laser 6000 mouse included . this new mouse more comfortable . ( not huge difference , but noticeable . ) it also lighter , slides around little effort . what i don't like :( 1 ) lock key above number pad set default display same two options when you click ' start ' then ' log off windows . ' i would liked option change key shut down / hibernate dialog instead . i haven't found option available , so far . ( 2 ) keyboard little bit wider than others , but i don't find it problem . it just different . additional programmable buttons outweighs downside extra width . five stars	1

still embarking spooling off all hi-8 tapes i , but i've very satisfied plextor unit so far . first thing i spool one hi-8 tape then make dvd , using functionality bundled windvd creator software . good news : it worked , few hours after i started , i watching dvd i created , my bedroom dvd player . bad news : software full minor sometimes more than minor annoyances . it may i'm still climbing learning curve it , but i think it just not very good . i'm looking into other solutions , such pinnacle , adobe premiere elements , etc . meanwhile , i keep spooling . i haven't yet tried tv capture any depth . it looked like it worked , but again , some annoyances software side . plextor could improve this offering vastly addition some better bundled software	-1

i lot research , not wanting rush into anything then regret it after seeing something else week later . i buy newest 40 " 720p samsung $1899 ... then i stumbled upon this one circuit city $1999 bought it spot ... paid $50 delivery it my living room three hours later . i've it week now , i love it . standard-definition picture quality just okay , but any us buying these tvs watch sdtv ? i get 15 hd channels through my cable company , including all four major networks plus espn , espn2 couple music movie channels . therefore , majority everything i watch available hd anyway . sdtv content still looks decent typical viewing distance 10-12 feet . hd content looks awesome ( including black levels ) , my cable provider broadcasts only 720p . i only imagine how good 1080p content going look once it becomes available . i'm going wait year or two high-definition dvd format war play out before i buy blu-ray or hd-dvd player . but i've watched standard-definition dvd my xbox this tv , picture beautiful . i'm sure high-definition dvd would look little better side-by-side comparison , but you not any complaints watching standard-definition dvd this tv . short , this excellent tv , especially compared other 1080p models its size range . if you're looking something range $2000-$2200 , this one you want . enjoy	1

look , bargain-basement product , what you expect ? first , you expect it work , i confirm it definitely work . when plugged usb , it signals xp correctly . driver software very tolerant . you install it any time there never resource conflict or problems system recognizing device . so installation 5 minute process . next comes capture initial encoding . well , software bit lame far features gui . typical . but it absolutely saves mpeg2 / dvd format just you'd need it making dvds all your dish network or ps2 or vhs content . frame rate full 30 fps . it takes svideo or standard rca video signal . both just fine quality . resolutions not great ... but its passable dvd when you crank it up . don't think you encode some blu-ray quality mpeg this though . far overall durability product , i've literally left mine plugged into wall running 1 year straight . it gets hot , but its never so much flickered or needed reset . bottom line ? this thing like kids toy- its cheesy but tough nails . get it your first analog signal mpeg encoder . its good value .	-1

pros : three customizable video profiles ( movies , broadcast tv ... ) ; excellent brightness contrast ; good viewing angles center ; generous input options ; cons : big , centered on/off button cries out my toddler turn it on/off/on/off . finally put 35lb barbell front i t.t he biggest con not tv but dearth hd content . others ' comments broadcast tv looking horrible hd sets cannot overemphasized . same dvds sd dvd players . latter note , buy good upcoverting dvd player ( lt ; $150 ); visual results simply outstanding . also note you need run component video minimum , hdmi preferred ; using s-video or composite complete waste money you spent tv . so other ' con ' you probably need new a/v receiver cables . so recap , if you want good experience , you need hd tv , upconverting dvd player , a/v receiver component or better yet hdmi connections , hd broadcast content ( cable or satellite ) . this not cheap endeavor	1

this little reader fast easy use usb flash drive . pop your card , plug it , wahlah , all your files shown . transfers very fast easy . it uses standard usb cable , so it likely you could use same cable variety devices ( mp3 player , camera , cell phone)the device somewhat flimsy , however front always snaps off when you try open unit rather than working like hinge , it should . this somewhat annoying reattach hinge everytime , so it gets 4 stars . still very good buy , especially price	-1

i bought this recently not knowing much what out market terms tablets , i some advice if you're going buy this product . pros : it shame wacom doesn't make tablets 5x7 since i found out this perfect size- it not so small you no room draw properly , it not big enough you hurt your arm long movements after tiring day work . price- i bought this 20 dollars local radioshack , but you get one much cheaper online compared wacom graphire which 4x5 upwards around 50 us dollars . it compatible almost every graphics software works remarkably well . unless you're professional graphics designer , you won't need any costly wacom tablets if you've got this . cons : when i first unpackaged it , i tearing my hair out two days trying figure out how make this work windows xp . all you out there similar problem , download this driver newer versions windows relax : http://www.compgeeks.com/drivers/kbgeartablet.zip pen sensitivity need set your desired pressure-sensitivity first , so don't try it out before going control panel changing settings . i find best setting use barrel button option left double-click . :) hope helped bit	-1

memorex makes excellent paper sleeve protect cds dvds lying around gathering dust . paper sleeves also particularly good when mailing cds dvd discs because they protect disc while reducing cost postage . it costs less mail cd dvd media paper sleeves than it mail same cds dvds slim jewel cases . this savings alone should make these sleeves pay themselves ! color white neutral doesn't distract you able focus label or other writing cd or dvd . i agree reviewer who notes there hole back sleeve into which you insert flap . this ensures cds dvds don't dislodge when they transit postal system or your car you take them one place . they also useful people who accumulated so many cds dvds store media even slim jewel cases now takes up too much room . overall , these good quality paper sleeves right price . i highly recommend these cd/dvd paper sleeves people who want practical cost-efficient alternative jewel cases .	1
i installed this unit my hp amd 64 x2 19-inch lcd monitor . installation very straightforward , no problems experienced . unit two rows power outlets - eight outlets total . all surge protected , but only one row battery backup . each row includes outlet offset allow transformer power supplies connected still accommodate use other outlets . unit also surge protects incoming telephone line , interacts well transparently my dsl service . unit comes usb connector cable used transfer information unit computer . also included " powerchute personal edition " software . this software replaces ups option used under " power " icon widow xp control panel . powerchute pe allows user selection alarms power options best fit user needs . powerchute pe automatically loads computer startup , resides icon right-side window task bar . it monitors unit status , provides information concerning abnormal power events occurred future reference . order assure there enough battery power this unit operate properly , i only attached pc monitor powered row outlets . transformers seem use lot power , gain most time available adequate shut-down times they should only plugged into " surge only " outlet row . when a/c power fails , unit immediately picks up power load . it then begin shut down pc if a/c power not become available shortly . default method it uses place pc into " hibernation mode " , saving desktop exactly " " future start-up . it accomplished this task my pc perfectly . if i wanted ups keep my computer running several minutes during a/c power outage , this not unit i would purchased . however , keep my system re-booting due power interrupted momentarily , or shut down pc safely should power outage last longer , this cost-effective solution those tasks .	-1

pros : three customizable video profiles ( movies , broadcast tv ... ) ; excellent brightness contrast ; good viewing angles center ; generous input options ; cons : big , centered on/off button cries out my toddler turn it on/off/on/off . finally put 35lb barbell front i t.t he biggest con not tv but dearth hd content . others ' comments broadcast tv looking horrible hd sets cannot overemphasized . same dvds sd dvd players . latter note , buy good upcoverting dvd player ( lt ; $150 ); visual results simply outstanding . also note you need run component video minimum , hdmi preferred ; using s-video or composite complete waste money you spent tv . so other ' con ' you probably need new a/v receiver cables . so recap , if you want good experience , you need hd tv , upconverting dvd player , a/v receiver component or better yet hdmi connections , hd broadcast content ( cable or satellite ) . this not cheap endeavor	1

i bought this mouse 14 months back !!! it working great ! pros : = = = = = = = = = = = 1 . nice design2 . good looks3 . ergonomic4 . i use it almost 14 hours day , need charge/replace battery like once month5 . good range : i not need buy rc because this . 6 . light weight/small7 . rotate usb transmitter 90 deg , hence work even if you vertical usb slots your laptop . cons : = = = = = = = = = = 1 . would liked it more if it internal battery some way charging it through usb connection . i use rechargeable battery , need charge it monthly .	1
i trying find way easily carry lot camera equipment quite some time . i tried backpacks , shoulder bags , duffel bags , but none them really worked all well . then i saw lowepro street field system completely customizable pouches , vests , belts , accessories . it works great , you only get pouches you need so there no waisted space you organize them however you want according how often they used ( put frequently used items easier access places . ) variety alone this system worth investment , but quality ease use also very high which big plus . you get case any lens , camera body , or accessory you . i even cases my cell phone water bottle . one word caution , sure measure your lens lens hood backwards if you use them make sure entire thing fit into pouch , because sometimes lens fit , but then lens lens hood not . i often carry 5-6 lenses , extension tubes , teleconverters , extra memory cards batteries , bunch cleaning supplies other gadgets , which weights ton . but when they evenly distributed this vest/belt lowepro system it actually very manageable . only down side everyone staring you because you thousands dollars camera equipment strapped your body . but if you overlook , this way go . i used this system many zoos without ever problems , fact just unzipping single lens switching seems safer me than opening entire bag equipment every time you want switch lenses . many cases also come built rain/snow cover so if weather changes all your equipment not destroyed . you also put just few pouches normal belt when you just going take photos back yard or don't need take all your equipment , which nice . i really can't say enough how much easier this makes traveling lot equipment , if you hopelessly searching better solution , consider this , you won't regret it .	1

we found this light very good quality . when purchasing , we also considered similar light black decker . this light seemed sturdier tighter construction . we bought locally , so we option testing these store , before we bought ( they all come packages which allow crank free , so you try them . both models , we discovered some work better than others . what i mean some bd work better than other bd some iluminators work better than others . this may due way they treated store - some used over over again before purchase . it took while , but we found one held charge long time . fact , when i charged it home , it lasted bright light ( three leds ) 1.5 hours kept emitting dim light 12 hours . one bd we purchased ( returned ) stayed only 10 seconds after charged two munutes ( not useful ) . advice : these internet-ordered probably more likely free in-store over-use ( repeat - probably ) . however , you also can't try them before buying . so , like many things you'll need weigh those pros cons . if you get good one , you'll probably agree it very good little flashlight . also - you probably find them locally $15 , so keep mind well .	1

garmin forerunner 305 awesome . it tracks numerous metrics your run including distance , pace , heart rate ( optional hr monitor ) , grade , elevation also real-time averages all these metrics . then docking station you dump all your training info computer software allows you review it things like create courses your workouts . only reason i gave it 4 stars rather than 5 included software leaves bit desired . maps very little detail my case i know they actually incorrect . i know garmin better map since i one their gps units my car it works great knows every little street . forerunner very good product really improved my training	-1
this great dvd player if you want play divx movies or mpeg files burned your computer onto cd-r , dvd-r , dvd+r etc . it plays just every media format any kind blank cd or dvd . it also plays standard store bought dvds just fine . i needed it because all dvds i made home would receive disc error when trying watch them my old toshiba . it connected played fine my 42 " flat screen lcd hdtv . photos burned onto cd also play slide show without connect your camera - very cool . only thing this player i would change would remote control . it looks cool but kinda clunky pointed precisely right spot player or you'll end up pushing button numerous times no effect . otherwise i'm more than satisfied continue use it long time	-1

first , me - i am hp printer bigot , pc user . i bought this printer print labels cds , installed it mac ( which i barely operate ) , so i'm really unfamiliar territory . said , printer software installed no problems . i printed test cd no problem , quality stunning ; significantly better than my hp 950c , which getting old , but still considered photo quality . i'm sure this partially due using 6 colors ink , instead 4 used hp ( i graphic arts background could explain why this , but not here ) . it also printed very fast - photo quality cd label printed less than three minutes . i very concerned this , because i afraid i would wait around 10 minutes per cd , which would made multiple printings very tedious . software designing cd labels great - much better than hp d5160 software , according features reviews i've read ( hp d5160 other printer i looking . it priced same epson r260 ) . replacement claria ink cartridges available all over internet under five dollars each ($5 ) - ignore other posts here , google it yourself . speaking ink costs , when buying printer you need proper mindset : printer free , you're really paying ink . this true virtually all home printers sold today . get used it . so here my summary : pros : outstanding print quality , very fast printing , low cost , good software . cons ( compared hp ): noisier , larger , probably uses more ink than hp .	1

buyers beware ! i never written or posted consumer rating my life . i am so disappointed vonage overall customer service ; i feel i no choice but warn others . vonage its own words not guarantee quality its service . vonage customers experience : ( 1 ) dropped calls , ( 2 ) garbled communications , ( 3 ) non-responsive dishonest customer service department . reason vonage not guarantee performance because it knows it cannot . my first mistake believing vonage help desk , during my initial , " 30 day money back guarantee period , " when they told me my issues due line quality not vonage . since then , i spent three months vonage my high speed internet service provider technicians attempting make this service work . all speed tests indicate my isp lines fine . i high speed internet technician visit my house last week only tell me everything checks out . all this said , my vonage phone never worked worse . i made call today recipient could not even discern whom i . when i finally threw towel decided vonage not me , i hit $39.99 service charge upon cancellation plus cost phone , despite documented lack performance day one . vonage performance substandard any measure . closely look all other options before bringing vonage into your life definitely terminate all agreements within your first 14 days avoid inevitable early termination fees . make sure you read below clauses vonage terms service agreement before you agree anything . vonage customer service manager , mike , sited these disclaimers when i told him i not satisfied service :( 1 ) " no warranties service , " section 4 , paragraph 4 ; ( 2 ) " return device , " section 2 , paragraph 10 ;( 3 ) " termination fee , " section 3 , paragraph 6 ; and(4 ) " money back guarantee ; limitations conditions , " section 3 , paragraph 7 . when i switched vonage , i simply looking reliable telephone service company stands behind its product supports its customers . vonage lack line reliability poor customer service motivated me document my experience . i call vonage customer service my old fashion landline because voice quality my vonage phone so poor i would not able conversation . after waiting 20 minutes talk service manager , mike , i told i contractually bound because i not terminate my agreement within first 30 days . this moment i thought stereotypical shady used car transaction . i lured buy vonage because promises great service all free bells whistles only " internet calling provide . " instead i received lemon , phone unreliable company not stand behind its product . while vonage may get my $39.99 termination fee cost vonage phone , i not feel i just lay down vonage failure perform . i feel compelled ( 1 ) warn others vonage hopefully save them aggravation i experienced ( 2 ) hit vonage where it hurts , economic pocket book . i am terminating my service soon possible .	-1

great thing this mouse other then excellent tracking great looks it built last i've mine 6 months now it still perfec t.t he exit cord etxra nub plastic so it takes falling off my desk much better then other laptop mice i've which failed due tired wire connections fact i think major reason most laser mice fail . mouse wheel lights up which i find annoying night but i'm sure lots people would just think it looks cool ( which it kinda ) i'm just not fan glowing computer parts trend thats all . great high rez gameing/laptop mouse , i play dod , bf2 etc this mouse it works great . i'm but my desktop . only cons i think ) if you huge hands you might not like it * shrug * don't really know . ) if some reason you find more then two buttons click wheel not eneugh buttons you might want something else ... personally i just end up hitting those buttons when i didn't mean , simple better	1

i essentially bought onkyo 804 receiver replace 10 year old onkyo model not digital unit ( obviously ) . i currently new sony 5-disc dvd/cd player panasonic dvd recorder directly input , hdmi connections , my 42 " panasonic plasma hdtv . receiver takes digital optical audio output tv ( use video 3 select receiver/remote control ) plays it through my 5.1 speaker system . also , dvd player digital coaxial audio output connects receiver coax input ( use dvd select receiver ) . course , my old onkyo cassette deck connects through regular rca jacks uses onkyo r1 proprietary line connection run cassette deck through receiver remote . note i not even need use receiver 2 hdmi inputs or 1 output this simple scheme . setup menus require using your tv screen , so you temporarily install plain rca video cord receiver monitor out tv convenient front video input jack i . this receiver many listening modes they all sound great . thx cinema mode my favorite . sound separation , particularly movie dialogue out center channel , outstanding . my dvd recorder also plays dvd audio discs , which superb this unit . setup not difficult if you read through manual twice before even starting . microphone speaker initiallization excellent ; works just advertised , you may over-ride any setting manually if you wish . note if you only use 5.1 speaker connections ( not 7.1 ) i , 4th 5th speaker connected side surrounds , not back surrounds ! i kept it simple still use all my original component remotes , if no other reason than they each more options available use than do-it-all receiver remote . i use receiver remote volume , radio tuner channel selector , input mode selector , listening mode selector , that it . money , best receiver i checked into , including some nice denon's! lots power connections . only took 3 days shipping too . unit run hot , so keep nothing top grill .	1
i sick swapping printers depending my print needs moment . i also not interested ' switch box ' either required manual flipping switch or paying much more automated directing your print job . one thing , i wanted my extra printer ( laserjet 5l ) stay where it -- extra desk , which not within reach standard printer cable computer . why couldn't i take advantage home network ( windows xp sp2 ) i'd installed which router box near extra printer ? so , i started my search affordable solution found netgear ps101 . reviews led me believe setup could touchy , but price , i decided give it try . well , it worked out great . setup turned out not difficult . i now seemless connection second printer all 4 computers network . works great ! ( sure shop around little , i think price varies greatly this product .	1

after literally years frustration my hp 1315 " all-in-one " printer , detailed my one star review item , i decided purchase this printer canon replacement because hp printer sitting yard getting rained ever since hp " award winning technical support " left me hold both chat services phone services two solid hours without any attempt fix problem . i cannot rate this item high enough . i purchased refurbished printer every respect high-quality brand new one . i dropped my avery business cards into machine viola ! 150 photo-quality business cards without hitch ! ( fairly fast , too ! ) i mean photo-quality . cards look like they just came professional printing house . part excellent design this printer paper isn't folded back over onto itself like hp printers . this means higher bond paper ( like photo papers , business card stock , resume ' paper , other thicker materials ) feeds straight through without getting caught , bound , or jammed ! no more cockeyed , misaligned printing ! no more smudges smears ! print cartridges smaller , but contain single colors -- no more sprinting office depot order four color cartridge because one color empty . buy only what you need . no more throwing away all your magenta yellow ink because cyan empty . scanning seems work well , ocr software contained installation actually translates typed word reasonably well . overall , excellent design . unfortunately , office depot tells me canon discontinued this model .

previous review mentions antennas key good cb setup correct . normal cb user i would recommend either wilson lil ' wil or wilson 500 antenna . both magnetic mount antennas . lil ' wil antenna relatively small antenna it only around $39.00 . actually any wilson cb antenna fine . also , good job setting up your antenna you should purchase swr meter . they not expensive . you only need meter connected inline radio antenna when you adjusting antenna . once you adjusting antenna you take meter out connection connect antenna directly radio . don't fooled cheap ordinary cb antennas like you find radio shack . not settle anything less then wilson antenna . cobra uniden both make fabulous cb radios so either make fine	1

i'm not going pretend say i'm great audiophile , pronounce these phones best ones ever made , because they probably aren't . but they first pair i've bought cost more than $20.00 . i haven't opportunity listen any expensive headphones tell difference . i bought these headphones replace pathetic ear buds came my new mp3 player . i admit i bought them because they look sooo cool ! they light me , they sound good , lot better than my ugly , $20.00 koss headphones . i bought pink pair because skullcandy donates money breast cancer charity . that important me , because my family lost my dear aunt ruth disease last june . i think her every time i slip these comfortable headphones listen my favorite tunes . i don't think these hadphones real serious audiophile , but if you like me , looking upgrade " cheap " pair headphones , look good doing it , go it	-1
i recieved this product christmas , i charged it once since then , listened it 3 - 1 hour rides , 1 - 4 hour ride 1 - 2 1/2 hour ride , batteries still full . 9 half hours nearly non stop battery bar hasn't even moved . i put 1,200 songs it , i still room , i even some 20 minute songs there . earphones kind uncomfortable . wristband allows it carried easily around , although it become uncomfortable after long periods time , because it tends loosen up after while . no artist name previously mentioned ..... you manually imput artist name so i don't know why you're complaining . sound output great , better than ipod , me several friends compared them . all all i highly reccomend this product , it only flaw it size , allows it misplaced very easily	1

i bought this microphone go one sony minidisc recorders . it very sensative . this , course , good thing - or bad . plugging mic directly into recorder ( without extension ) not worth much because it picks up so much sound unit itself - very distracting . so , one must use included extension move it away uni t.t he mic also very sensative movement ( similar wind noise ) so one really needs just set it out-of-the-way location leave it . even turnig volume unit down ( which operates similar mics " gain " level ) leaves unit very ( you guessed it ... ) sensative nearby noise . i guess ideally i wish two mics weren't quite so omnidirectional	-1

i shocked read previous reviews since my experience totally opposite . my phones don't only work perfectly but they also comfortable , small , clear reception . i've purchased motorola products before they all worked great ( so far least ) . i live apartment where many other wireless devices used my neighbors these phones held their ground just fine ( not like microsoft wireless mouse/keyboard combo i recently bought ) . i also voip service ( voice over ip aka internet phone ) company named broadvoice ( much better cheaper than vonage ) they work great . i really no complaints all this product although some improvements could made ( e.g. internal battery so it doesn't lose time or 2 phone line support would nice , but i'm splitting hairs )	1

i bought this phone cousin ( keypad , answering machine base ) myself six months ago , like it lot . i've since referred it two other people who both histories crappy cordless home phones . they both bought this phone both love it . only identified probems : when recalling caller id number , phone not add 1 out-of-area calls . so cid return feature only works numbers my area code . once great while phone , when picked up off receiver , search not connect giving " out range " message . while this sounds like major problem , it happens rarely fixed simply picking up speaker phone base .	-1

i excited this product couldn't wait get it . got one christmas well ... hmmm . after trying it out couple days i'm pretty dissapointed . i use it usb 2.0 while plate pretty cold , beverage not . i tried it glass , then thinking aluminum would conduct cold better . difference almost negligible . it barely keeps already cold beverage cool ... certainly doesn't cool room temperature beverage even after sitting unit hour . it somewhat cool if volume liquid very low(an inch or less ) rather neat idea just didn't totally come fruition . you're better off just using beverage cozy .	-1
i got this phone because i thought it looked cool thought it would interesting phone talking you talk into different way- this phone , mouthpiece mounted top rotating socket you hold earpiece up your ear . it definitely different look , you see it action - say , person actually using it - fully appreciate aesthetic effect . there few nice things this phone , such braided cord both telephone jack connecting earpiece main part . however , what i think disappointing true purists these phones made out modern , lightweight , cheap-feeling plastic rather than type heavyweight plastic make genuine plastic phones 1920s-1970s feel so substantial comfortable hand . so , i give crosley points just producing such item , it indeed work fully functional telephone fairly well , although what people other end line tell me , drop signal strength distance increases microphone quite steep , indicating microphone perhaps not good choice this device . sum , i think this phone worth price , but know it not necessarily going or feel like real period piece . said , there no wiring problems	-1

this product , my opinion , all anyone could ever want ipod external battery . when i go long trips via airplane , i watch video whole way across u.s. this . iboost also allows you never remove your ipod it again ; you charge synchronize your ipod without removing it iboost , just drop whole package into ipod dock . my ipod video 5.0 30gb held snugly retention arms foam spacer pad . foam spacer pad removable fit larger ipods	1

i am digital photo junkie - addition taking tons photos i use several programs edit them before i print . problem i ones i end up printing special projects or large format , i don't many regular 4x6 photos around . my older epson stylus photo r300 prints great photos , but just takes too long printing out 4x6 photo albums . end i literally thousands pictures just sit my hard drive . then comes this picturemate snap i just received my birthday . it perfect those everyday pictures ! just pop disk , select photos press print .. out come high quality prints snap ! no computer - no software needed - completely portable . it like turning my digital camera into polaroid . i doubly impressed extra features it , not only viewer but ability zoom , crop , red-eye , add borders , turn bw or sepia few button clicks . it handle carrying very lightweight . i don't plan use this my computer since i two other epson printers already . i would highly recommend this anyone digital camera . only drawback i found so far print packs hard find local stores , you'll want get one right away because supplied pack only print 20 photos . i expect longer snap market , easier packs find . i like they come paper ink set number photos . overall great product	1

i've always found cheapie little ear buds sold airlines order watch their movies utterly useless . besides not fitting my ears ( they fall out ) , even volume turned all way up , i simply couldn't understand movie dialog softer passages over roar aircraft noise . i'd watch other passengers envy while they relaxed comfortably using noise canceling headphones . i decided that what i needed ! when i started shopping pair noise canceling headsets long cross-country flight my wife i going take , i decided even though bose quietcomfort models highly rated , i couldn't justify spending much money something we'd only use maybe 2 or 3 times per year . after lot research looking less expensive alternatives , based features , price , reviews i read , i settled creative labs hn-505 one buy . my wife i recently used this model over 10 hours each cross-country trip we found they worked quiet well ... but few minor shortcomings . interestingly , one leg our trip i opportunity try out bose quietcomfort ii headset passenger sitting next me compare it side-by-side cl hn-505 . here my observations : * cl hn-505 absolutely incredible value money ! i'd definitely buy it again . * fit earcup sort hybrid true " over-the-ear " ( like bose qc ii ) " on-the-ear " design ( like bose qc iii ) . earcups sit part way over ear not completely seal off outside noise . presumably this design makes them more compact less bulky storage . * my wife found earcups bit tight her ears ( squeezing her head ) . she got tired them her head after 3 or 4 hours . careful adjusting headset i didn't this problem . * while they effectively remove " roar " aircraft noise , they their limits . since they only mask noise within certain frequency band up certain volume level , they'll still allow some noise through reduced volume . if you're expecting complete silence when you turn them , then you'll sadly disappointed ! yes you still hear announcements aircraft pa system still faintly hear baby crying back plane , but they effective reduce overall volume all noise tolerable , comfortable level . there very noticeable difference when they're turned off . * soft rushing sound ( almost like white noise ) heard background when turned . this isn't noticeable noisy environment like airline flight . * when i compared bose quietcomfort ii headset cl hn-505 side-by-side , i found bose quieter than cl ... * but * keep mind bose qc ii true " over-the-ear " design whereas cl hn-505 not . i say performance bose qc ii wouldn't convince me pay * ten * times price cl hn-505 * i watched several movies flight found dialog even most quiet passages easy understand . * i like fact cl hn-505 only uses one aaa battery it conveniently hidden head strap ( not cord ) . * on-off switch located rear right earcup within easy reach while wearing , but this same location makes it way too easy accidentally turn it when storing it carry baggage . several times i've gone retrieve my headset it storage bag , only find it turned some unknown length time . good news battery seems last very long time . i've used mine over 10 hours plus time it accidentally only one battery so far , it still going strong . * i'll never again travel without them	1

past two weeks or so i've testing out philips shs3200 clip earbuds . verdict : return . they very , very uncomfortable , even if sound great it doesn't matter if you can't actually use headphones . which means i revert ot my sony pair couple days . i found these big discount only ... three dollars . i needed this pair pretty desperately , or least it would suffice until i found something i'd want major retailer . only other time i've bought earhugger would eh710 over head headphones which i also rated 4 stars , but someone begged me those , so i gave them away . they sounded nice comfortable i also remember getting them discount . these , i wasn't expecting much , just something sounds ok fits well . which actually what you get , except sound bit better than ok . these clip earbuds , much like popular sony . ear . they usual earbuds but clip goes around your ear more comfort more stable fit . that really all you get , but three dollars how earth you expect extras ? it also long five foot cord so it won't awkward walking these your ipod or so your pocket . i've also noticed hook detachable , so if you just want buds then you . sound quality , these don't sound amazing but sound good , especially because price i thought these gonna flat out suck but they're actually pretty darn good . they don't fantastic deep bass , but they full bass what they , making them sound full rich . mids sounded good , not overpowering nor mids lacking , maybe bit much 200-500k range , but it not all bad . these don't amazingly clear sound if that what you're looking , these lack treble little bit , but again price i can't expect stellar sound . i put these little music test , they sounded good my ipod cd player but pretty average itunes unless i tweaked equalizer bit . my stereo system they sounded fine but best when playing cd . they sounded good most my music collection , sounded really good hip-hop , rb , dance , spoken word , light rock . when i turned hard rock or hard hitting rap it sounded kinda tinny , but still listenable . i turned bass boost itunes my other protable audio sources handled all sounded fine , but higher volumes ( more than 80% volume ) things started disort or sound tinny . overall , not amazing sound , pretty good bass average elsewhere . these some darn comfortable headphones me . when i put them i get good fit automatically but those who've never tried these types earbuds before might feel slight discomfort first week use or least it'll feel weird . just know if they're uncomfortable box you should give them least two weeks before returning . something else you should know these come lifetime warranty ! well , course there catch . you send five dollars shipping . relly there not much worth warranty since i found them three dollars , but if you paid more than five dollars it probably good idea keep packaging receipt around . i said , i only paid three dollars these big lots , chances that best price around . price you going get comfortable set clip-buds that'll sound decent last least couple months , maybe more if you're gentle or using these home . you'll probably find these three eight dollars , paying more rip-off since you probably find something better or something extra bells whistles like volume control or waterproof features . overall , not bad set headphones . they don't same sound headphones more than ten dollars but comfortable sound good enough price . good sound , comfortable , inexpensive , check them out ! 4 stars . response earlier review , these don't volume control	-1

returned it , phone kept dropping calls other side house , some times next room , no reception all yard . we used old ( 8-9 years old ) 900mhz phone really good range , could go all over house outside ( even across street ) still get crystal clear reception , but phone dropped too many times stopped working :-( however , even replacement i got ( uniden 5.8 ghz ) not much better far range , we returning one too . so search phone good range continues . i wish someone would make simple phone decent range , i really not care all new bells whistles such color screen , calendars , ring tones etc . all i need basic phone wont drop calls other side house , speaker both handset base , keypad base ( so i make calls without handset ) answering machine 30 minutes recording time ( decent quality , so i understand messages left it ... ) long battery life auto redial . phone book nice but not mandatory	-1

these brush cleaner cd work , believe it or not . perhaps not quite same your system professionally serviced , but why waste more money than you may . this worthy investment look into first - because these work most time ( it always good idea one continued preventative maintenance anyway ) . if you're getting play errors or severe skipping your cd , you might amazed how much one these help . but here few tips those you making audio cd their home computers trouble playing them some machines ... it may not defective or dirty player all . first , it may best turn off any other programs you may running background . this give your cd burner full resources its burning job . also , make sure your screensaver turned off . if it starts up middle job , laser burn may interrupted cause errors . so shut down all other programs screensaver too . second , it may you well defrag your hard drive before starting burn . if you pretty fast pc , this may not big problem , but it may adversely affect read data process if your computer search all over hard drive find pieces media files before burning them disk . i personally auto defrag program installed my computer runs constantly keeping my system running its optimum . third , i recommend not copying cd " fly " ( other words , directly disk disk ) . copy audio files your hard drive first . most cd burning software " create image " option - use then burn image blank cd . if your using nero , just turn off " fly " option music files copy hard disk first then cd automatically . by-the-way , you may want read my review amazon nero . it , my opinion , best burning software available ! since i started using nero , i not know meaning word " coaster " or " frisbee . " fourth , always burn cd dao mode ( disc once ) . this insure there no gap songs(tao - track once - usually leaves 2 second gap songs causes laser stop burning momentarily songs ) , but more importantly , using dao insure laser continues burn constantly throughout whole cd copying process . finally , most importantly ( my opinion ) , make sure you don't burn cd anything faster than 12x ! fact , if you're playing cd older system , burn cd 8x or even slower . if you still trouble , take speed all way down 1 or 2x . it make big difference . yes , i know it means you won't using full potential your zippy 52x burner , but you just figure out what more important - fast burning or able actually listen what your burning ? most newer cd players very little or no problem all playing cd burned computer highest speed ; however , this not often case much older units . general rule it always better burn audio disks slower . you may also want make sure you're using audio cd certified media . may help little bit too . brand media may factor also . sometimes cheaper cd may higher failure rate . i've heard this some people . personally , i not too much trouble cheaper cd ... usually , if steps i already mentioned followed , cheap media work fine . my experience anyway . but different burners may factor well you may want try some different brands media until you find one seems work best you . using quality name brand media probably safe bet may your best course action . good luck ! :	1

i bought this tv after seeing my father-in-law samsung hdtv ( he lns3251d ) . i seen bunch hdtv but i really liked crisp , clear , bright picture samsung . i also loved how light it comparison my 80lb . tube tv . this model little bit cheaper than my father-in-law , but offers same terrific picture ( i believe only difference his comes " piano black " ) . i ordered through amazon ( great price ! free shipping ! ) picked up tv eagle usa instead taking day off work wait them drop it off . they very helpful friendly . when i first got tv i thought something might've wrong it since my picture worse than my previous tv using same directv box . much i adjusted it picture blurry , moving objects left trails picture seemed scroll . however , ever since directv came gave me hd box ( optomized widescreen picture ) installed hd satellite i able appreciate this tv . must-have any sports fan poor eyesight	1

i got these because my old ibm thinkpad laptop " speakers " can't really heard unless you're hovering right over them , i'm not headphone fan ( besides , there nobody disturb ) , quality those built speakers worse than tinny . when i listen streaming video certain web sites , i want park laptop away me something else . hence search external but portable speakers . these indeed come neat storage box everything fits into without you puzzle master . hookup no-brainer , size , sound amazing . i even tried them classical music cd , they fine . " 3d " feature makes them sound like much bigger speakers . supplied usb power cable nice , attached protective cap usb end . controls simple it wake up low volume good design . they're exactly described specs preceding reviews . all i could offer wish list : storage box not something you'd carry around , so i'll probably manufacture simple carrying bag . if you going use it portable player , you wouldn't even need pack input extension power cables , just little dog-bone shaped device itself short input cable tucked neatly inside . speaker part tend drop kerclunk ! base when you unfold it until you know it going . i also noted if you don't little inplut cable carefully tucked into base , speaker part leaves dent cable , which would wearing after while , input cable hardwired into speaker case , so difficult repair/replace . also , i wish there power input cable besides usb cable , so you wouldn't use batteries devices like portable cd players . but i'm very pleased this purchase .	1

i previously owned canon printer time rated high it served well but old photo quality getting worse point where wife getting our photos developed elsewhere . after reading up newer printers i took our flash card store tried it using hp printer . say i amazed would understatement . i went home immediately ordered printer amazon blew away competition price . when i got it i printed photo my wife previously developed shop side side she guess which which but it close she just amazed . i don't know all technical stuff but i know if you looking great photo printer your home you'll hard time beating this one . since we use computer fix print photos i opted 7160 instead 7360 , screen printer not big deal me since they same printer otherwise . if there anything negative say it would advertised printing speed not exactly accurate ( least not quality photo i printing ) but then i don't think any printers advertised . nevertheless , this winner	1

digital technology , monster cable once again ruined marketplace greatly over estimating what their products worth . great difference digital output/inpt devices compared analog simple . if digital signal reaches device it needs it can't any more or less clear . because your digital signal comprised " 0 " " 1 " if you see your tv or hear music then what ever cable you use works- there no distortation across digital signals , so don't pay extra money- fact you shouldn't need spend more than around $30-50 .	-1

excellent value quality . easy set-up take down . portability factor great going almost anywhere	1
i'm very satisfied unit . it exactly what i expecting it . it works good either 120v or 4-aa battery power . portability very good included travel bag - i it set up work during week bring it home most weekends . also , it takes up very little space so it placed most anywhere . my only complaint volume control . adjust volume you hold +/- buttons loooong time because it changes soooo slowly . also when you turn unit it always reverts same preset volume level no matter what sound level when it turned off . this very annoying times . workaround , i unplug antenna no signal present , i power up altec . then hold - volume loooong time , then plug antenna . if i've guessed correctly , volume lower when signal returns . overall , i would buy same system again	-1
not only lx7 handily svelte when compared many mice similar features , but it ergonomic dream . side-to-side scroll wheel wonderful feature quickly becomes indispensable . back forward buttons placed sensibly facilitate 2-fingered use instead other models ' more cumbersome thumb-buttons . top all this , mouse absolutely miserly when it comes power use . so much so , fact , i've using mine only single aa battery place . my two niggling irritations ? fact battery sensor tells only when your batteries dead or dying one . but i'll give based aforementioned efficiency . secondly , logitech setpoint pre-programmed button mappings take some retooling get mouse working more than few common applications . that okay me too ; i like they allow you control change them least . all all excellent product .	1

althought it indicates 7500 rpm 400 mbs transfer via usb 2.0 or firewire , it seems not best performance access . i think it great used storage disk or quick back up media but i not recommend it use it your daily activities -such installing programs constant write/read accesses	-1
radio very easy use excellect reception , even antenna folded up . while not shortfall radio , rather noaa/nws system , county areas too big . example tornado warning issued this past weeked ; while nearly sunny my location , warning came out weather issue miles away , but still same county . also , plan batteries available when running off 110v battery drain high . i think this caused because weather radio always listening emergency tones . overall very good value i would suggest one every home	1

i've owned creative zen ipods , but nothing touch this thing . if you nice home or car stereo equipment , this player . first , it plays cd quality ( flac ) lossless files , so instead compressing your music sorry mp3 format average 192 kbps you listen music it intended 1411 kbps . many say there no difference , but plug this thing into your home receiver or car stereo you definitely hear it . second , ( very important me ) , you bypass itunes or any other memory resident programs designed " help " load your music into your player - just plug cowon into your computer usb port it becomes additional drive . you then drag drop your files - it simple . it well build , solid feel it . it line-in recording jack wich come handy . it play videos , also . screen small watching movie it ( approx 1 7/8 " ) , but i not watch movies this or any other player screen . even 3 " too small ! time when nobody owns anything smaller than 40 " hd flatscreen why world would you want watch movie little thing ?? anyway , me personally simplicity superior sound quality what i look such gadget . now , i not use my home system cd player any more : i plug this thing into my receiver access my collection high definition music cd quality . i get my car , same thing . no more cd lose , scratch , destroy or forget where i put them . they all archived both my computer drive cowon . it sad see this , but we're all flocking buy products like ipod zune which nothing but impose more more restrictions upon us : buy ( or should i say , rent ) music only their sites , use only their sorry proprietary formats , force us use their proprietary itunes such programs , which invade , crash slow down your computer so forth . not mention zune , which not even play window media files !!!. conclusion , this product definitely worth looking . it gives you freedom flexibility lot things your music .	1
i run this alarm my expedition last 4 years . it true these remotes require some extra care , they provide you wealth knowledge your vehicle situation while you indoors . compatible only top line d.e.i. alarms ( viper included ) . this 2 way remote let me know commands i sent received . it alleviates lot guesswork . glance , i know if my doors locked/unlocked , if car running ( remote start ) or not . if alarm triggered , it even shows me zone triggered when alarm tripped ( it actually shows which door/window opened/broken , or if car hit ) . i too bought replacement remotes this alram , but i knew what i getting into when i bought it start . those you who don't need 2-way function , its important know you program one-way remotes ( much less expensive ) work alarm brain too . i strongly suggest extra remotes every alarm . you should also know locate your valet button case you bypass alarm without ( working ) remote . when you drop computer , its roll dice if it keep working , or not . i've run this alarm 4 years , drop my keys regularly , only needed replace two remotes . i too found customer service joke dei , solve problem my own . but alarm itself great ! hope this helps	-1

i'd like start asking why some you given this system bad reviews because you couldn't hook your computer or whatever up correctly . don't punish product because lack research your part ! download manual or read product description - it clearly states " control module features standard analog stereo audio input two digital audio inputs -- one coaxial one toslink optical . " there no mention multichannel analog inputs , so if you don't optical or coaxial digital outputs , don't buy it ! or , what i ... purchase creative soundblaster mp3+ . this little device attaches your computer via usb allows output ( input ) pure optical digital stream . hook optical cable it klipsch disk voila , dolby digital your computer . external soundblaster live !, soundblaster audigy 2 , philips aurilium also work . system itself . i also creative t5400 , but i wanted something dolby digital decoder so i could hook them up my laptop cheap home theatre setup . i bought this klipsch sale $130 , it fits bill . some complain hiss - i'm experiencing noise too , but it more whine slight bit hiss , more pronounced when i'm using analog input . it might due electrical quality , too ... my creatives never hissed school , but my new apartment , i get noise through them . noisy electrical power outlets cause problems . i think sound pretty good . nothing spectacular , but what i expected . clear good off-axis sound ... mine ten feet away , i get better soundstage without tip-in . sub really good job so small - i put mine corner , it'll move couch . i find it too much music usually , so i turn it down 0 , up +4 movies . system could use more power my application ( decent sized room ) , but that not really what it made . so i'll forgive system . i like assortment processing - native format ( dd 5.1 or 2.1 channel stereo ) , 5.1 stereo , two types dolby pro logic ii , which i'm fan . latter gives good 5.1 sound stereo source , without too overbearing . range adjustment center , surrounds , sub nice , o.o ne thing i really wished system remote control . it couldn't expensive incorporate , would nice touch . i know i could put control disk my table , but i don't want cord running across floor . bottom line , if you're going purchase this , realistic . it not going best system world , but it decent , cheap way get dolby digital or pro logic ii decoding computer , game console , or stereo source . make sure you connect it before purchase , you'll ok . i'll give it four stars somewhat noisy , lack remote , fact i don't think it should cost $300 retail	-1

i bought this november ' 05 so i've bit time get familiar product . overall this great receiver someone looking most bang buck . next higher this series ( de998 i think ) practically exact same features , maybe 10 watts more per channel , so my opinion not worth difference price this version . setup annoying ( but not impossible ) . you push buttons turn setup knob all while reading tiny lcd display . several times during setup i would get desired setting , read more manual , time i got back unit setup mode disappeared . course this awkwardness disappears you become more familiar machine . on-screen programming setup one features not included this machine -- but remember how much you paid ! remote very annoying small buttons confusing setup instructions . i programmed it control my dvd player , tv , cable box vcr . once while it " forgets " how talk cable box some reason , or gets confused which component ( e.g. , cable box or dvd player ) it talking . this doesn't happen often but it happened two or three times . fortunately setup not last forever this not exercise you doing machine daily basis . also , most time remote correctly remembers which component it supposed talking . said , sound quality fantastic ! this machine shake walls sound if you turn it up far enough . i not normally listen my music this deafening volume most time but if i am real headbanger mood it happen . when using receiver very high volumes it get hot , not just warm . keep this mind when you place unit , it alot vents top unit . unit convert composite inputs s-video output , which not clear reading manual . i bought this athena 15345 point 5 mkii system home theater speaker package audiosource psw100 10 inch powered subwoofer . this fills livingroom sound quite nicely . also those us who still turntables , you hook yours up this machine -- feature lacking most other units i considered . if i thousands dollars my disposal looking absolute best receiver i would course get something else . although less-than-perfect setup routine remote , this unit produces exceptional sound acceptable price i would recommend it anyone looking great sounding receiver affordable price	-1

although hp laserjet 13x ( q2613x ) costs 20% more than laserjet 13a ( q2613a ) , it superior buy number reasons . topping list lower cost per page . 13x print 4000 pages 5% page coverage ( iso/iec 19752 standard ) whereas 13a print 2500 pages . that 37.5% difference page yield . divide up toner price against 4000 ( e.g. , 91.99 / 4000 = 2.3 cents ) get cost per page . secondly , laser toners last long time whether you print few times month or dozens pages day ( they don't dry out ) . finally , higher page yield means fewer toner replacement . my only complaint 13x ( goes 13a well ) page yield cost some competing printers higher-end hp laserjets even less	-1

if you college student , or anyone who deals math , i highly recommend you purchase this calculator . it excellent tool performing many types calculations both algebra , seemingly , calculus , although i only used it algebra so far . unlike other , disappointing graphing calculators , this one permits you use undefined variables ( i.e. , ' ' stands nothing except ' ' unless you want it , which immensely helpful performing algebraic calculations . ) qwerty keypad also makes entering expressions pleasure , rather than chore ; this more than academic point when you test time-limit , hitting ' alpha ' key before typing every variable depicted letter ( , , , , etc . ) use up precious time maybe ensure you don't get all problems . there too many easy-to-use incredibly convenient features this calc list here ; but it truly worth hefty price tag . my only gripes manual sometimes bit obscure ( though it easy comprehend compared most graphing calc manuals ) calc no nthroot function i find , , find cube root number you enter it x^1/3 . these very minor points , though , splendid product	1

i just looking something listen music while i worked out . this player very basic , but money exactl what it says . it holds enough songs get me through 2 1/2 hour routine . sounds pretty good very easy work . couple drawbacks : headphones come it very short cord battery runs down pretty fast ( usually replace it once week , so i guess it run 10 hours total before it needs new battery ) . other than it looks pretty cool very small ( fits my pocket while i walk around ) .	1

i've owned e3c last two years let me say they best sounding earphones ( or headphones ) i'd heard up until point . anyhow , they went defective me few months ago rather than fork out $70 get them repaired since they now out 2yr warranty period ( shure replace them free during warranty no hassle whatsoever , way ) i decided plunk down cash e500 . i got them cheap , because how i roll , but they're worth retail how good they . you may already know now e3c single-driver phones they blow away any standard fare your neighborhood electronics store . also , you might wondering , like i , just how much better triple-driver phones than single-driver ones ... whether they're worth hundreds dollars more they cost . assuming one appreciates music sound quality enough spend decent money phones first place , let me say i taken risk you , homework you put word out streets , er , well , online review , anyway , you : e500 killer . you'd better ask somebody . drop your concerns . these worth hundreds dollars more than single-driver phones , if you care enough notice difference . i listen lot jazz fusion fast , popping baselines , drumming smallest fractions beats you imagine synth work match . e500 , i'm actually able hear detail not come through e3c . when i say detail , i'm talking synth chords drums those fractional beats i literally not even realize present albums i've owned 10+ years . bass , it somewhat deficient e3c compared these . i dealt two years because they sounded better than anything i could buy store despite . only single driver both treble bass , e3c best they they fantastic , given what they . e500 , however , their two bass drivers single treble driver each phone , pose no compromise listener . read again ; it strong statement . believe you're getting something real what these cost . bass strong deep , drums , tight airy , mid-ranges `meat potatoes ' your soundscape , fat loud , accuracy devastating . we're talking sound literally gives me chills times . e500 comfort issue me first ; small ears , i initially found them less comfortable than e3c since housing these considerably larger order accommodate three drivers . now , after three months using these , they almost comfortable me e3c . i would say i need take them out after 30-40 minutes sake earlobe comfort , but , all fairness , i usually need take them out other reasons way more often tha t.t he pth ( push-to-hear ) module joke . i guess it works , sort . you try it out thirty seconds , curse fact some portion dough you spent these phones went towards this nonsense , put it back box , never use it again . thankfully , you not use it since it separates phones nicely . shame shure forcing people buy this stupid , worthless accessory , insulting intelligence people who appreciate good sound not realizing how unprofessional it package this crut expensive , high-end earphones . i won't even get into fact `pth ' part earphone model name . someone should get fired this debacle , seriously . lexus probably wouldn't force you buy fuzzy dice hydraulics ls460 , those things cool boot . earphones themselves still bomb	1
just got this product my birthday , because armband came my nano too small fit around my upper arm . after reading review inalaska , i decided give this one try i am close same size ( 5'11 " 225lb ) . item just described his review , my thoughts pretty much same ( my screen protector not damaged ) . package good value 90% people who purchase it very pleased . unfortunately , i'm minority , because it still too small fit comfortably around my upper arm . if your upper arm 17 " or larger , armband not fit unless you pull it uncomfortably tight ( cutting off circulation ) . i'm going try stretch it see if it eventually lengthen . if it works , i'll amend this review . still , solid 4 stars quality value .	-1

i bought pair january loved them . sound lovely everyone describes . however , there something seriously lacking build quality . soft wires felt flimsy me when i first opened it , but i thought i'd just take extra care . 1 month careful usage , plastic-covered wires earbuds downwards became so weather-hardened i could almost use them chopsticks , makes it so earbuds popped out slightest motion . 2 months careful usage , wires half-ripped plug -- which i repaired best i could unsightly electrical tape . however , 3rd month , left bud fell completely off . i am very disappointed -- it one best-sounding phones i've ever ( i've owned both grado s60 s90 , sennheisers ) , but man , they need something making this baby last	-1

both items worked well . light sufficiently bright light up keyboard effectively , while not too glaring , fan worked silently expectedly light breeze . main problem this item price . $17 , desk lamp would provide far more illumination than small usb light . likewise , one could purchase fan lamp less than $20 . stated this , fan/usb light combination perfect when working room where lights necessarily dimmed , such when presenting speech/presentation . i using light around two hours day past 6 months am pleased find manufacturer claims regard led longevity holding true . conclusion , while both products worked perfectly , they really limited use suitable only those who spend long hours where darkened environment necessity .	-1
hi . i find this product very good , but also could find features need improvement . first all , i bought this stuff last year returned it because our laptops couldn't recognize it netwrok . later , i remembered xp sp2 patches installed our machines just before i tried use keyspan server . since sp2 automatically turns xp firewall function , our laptops perhaps failed recognize usb server because this . i wasn't wrong . when i re-bought installed usb server later , i reconfigured security options xp my laptops so firewall doesn't block port used usb server . voila , i could see list usb equipments connected this little gizm o.o nce i configured it right , i found out this thing very convenient just everything . here my equipments attached it : cdrw , fdd , external hdd , printer . all these gadgets working seamlessly now . however , besides above configuration problem , i experienced one or two problems so far . ( if i haven't , i would've given 5 stars this stuff . ) when my epson 5200 all-in-one died clogging problem i purchased lexmark 5270 , autoconnect function keyspan usb server didn't work new all-in-one very well . i strongly suspect it because lexmark poor device driver ; however , it true keyspan usb server incompatible some all-in-ones . i returned lexmark 5270 bought epson stylus c82 . matter fact , i believe usually this goes epson printers all-in-ones . bottom line : i recomment this machine anyone who wants more than one pc usb equipments . however , you need check your pcs ' firewall configuration , when you buy this stuff or buy usb equipment , keep your receipt week or two . you may return this stuff or , if you already one , your new usb gizmo because compatibility issues	-1

i used most gaming mice released since year 2000 . prior deathadder , my mouse choice logitech g5 . i am not going bash either mouse . both very good . however , i prefer deathadder more . ( note : make sure you upgrade firmware . this make difference lift off issue some people complained about)after tweaking sensitivity where i like it , i noticed deathadder feels more smooth accurate than g5 . i am not sure if it 1000hz polling or sensor , but something feels very right it . only movement issue i getting used lift off height . new firmware improves this lot . however , it took couple days train myself lift mouse slighlty higher , but i am completely used it now . i think g5 might initially more user friendly here , but it only takes matter few days get used deathadder . other items feel " right " me side buttons . they seem perfectly balanced just right amount pressure make it easy depress , but tough enough not accidently press them . i really don't care " back " " forward " internet explorer . i just want usable buttons bind inventory items games . g5 bit let down there only one , reasonably hard button depress . scroll wheel my opinion better than g5 . deathadder again seems like razer found perfect compromise scroll click feel . however , like most mice , scroll wheel button really not option high intensity online game . deathadder might little less usable than g5 since wheel smoother , but i found myself scrolling down while trying depress button . so i don't really use it now , i just wanted give it shot . one thing g5 side side scrolling . however , i never really use anyway , even spreadsheets , so there no negative points my book . however , if you rely this feature , this mouse might not you . terms comfort , i big hand i find deathadder more comfortable play games over long period time . i rest my palm top more instead hovering it off back i g5 . terms craftmanship , i would say i am pleased . mouse feels well built very solid . i would say it par logitech build quality ( except g7 , don't get me started stalling , freezing , totally not " bullet proof connectivity " pos ) . considering looks , deathadder really attractive person . it reminds me exotic sportscar . my g5 silver , rust colored black . it not terrible , but deathadder more sleek refined . i see little iconic razer boomslang 2000 shape it too . i find pulsing blue logo really cool too . it so happens my case black blue leds inside my keyboard g15 so deathadder matches my color scheme . overall , razer winner this death adder . me , it feels just right it very smooth accurate . after couple days , i am used it loving it . if you g5 happy it , you probably don't need buy this one . if your like me like try new things , this might perfect mouse you try .	1
possibly worst design armband . fifth-grader could make better armband felt , velcro , scissors some thread . not only you not see nano screen , or adjust volume while you running ( changing volume like trying text message gloves ) , but you cannot adjust tightness band just one hand , it too little elesticity too small velcro strip . top it off , nano kinda difficult get out band .	-1

this great little unit client pvr such beyondtv or sage - i use sagetv my house 3 these clients running free plug specific sage . they work great , picture super , since there no moving parts or excessive heat they're completely silent - they work perfectly . i don't think i'd get one run just stand alone it fetching media pictures such off remote computers - application comes it not greatest . but since i'm using sage interface , no problems . only downside , although it small one , response remote just little sluggish - not bad , but aware when you hit " skip ahead " button when watching recorded tv program it'll lag , perhaps , half second . i've gotten used it don't mind all . since i automatic commercial skip sage , i rarely use it anyway	-1
i received this product within 3 days . drum works without problem . excellent service product	1

my old alarm clock radio recently bit dust , so i started search upgrade . i initially looked bose , but stumbled upon sangean radios . i usually listen npr jazz evening , sangean seemed fit bill . plus , i really like design . price . amazon got it me 3 days free shipping , i haven't disappointed radio performance . it great sound , remote control great other side bed ( when you don't want reach over your partner turn it off ) . couple things consider , however . backlight readout adjustable , but lowest setting bit bright dark room . fortunately , brightness control right front . i just turn off backlight before drifting off sleep . backlight also separate setting when radio " off " " . " thing . radio not display time when it . this so broadcast digital data display while playing ( e.g. , stations data broadcasting , display scrolls name station , title song , etc . ) . it would nice see time when you wake up ( after you hit snooze few times ) , but it not big deal . just touch " display " button front , radio switches display time . we also analog clock opposite bedside table . yes , there snooze function ( 5 min . ) , although product info doesn't mention it . you activate it touching any buttons front . sangean also thoughtfully designed alarm volume gradually increase it comes , so you aren't jolted awake . all said , i would recommend this radio . it looks great performs well . price , i'd say it great buy	1

i really wanted like this phone all good reviews , but received one issues , returned it received same issues ; so it must phone model . below items not involve using handset speakerphone feature which requires " wait you " " wait me " behavior ; just normal handset . -when you first answer incoming call , you usually wait few seconds phone make available 2 way converstion ; otherwise , you say hello caller can't hear you you can't hear them . -during call using normal handset , background noise even regular conversation cause phone block volume caller though you using speakerphone feature when you're actually not . after few seconds volume become audible again . this issue causes bits pieces conversation go unheard . this happens more long distance calls than local calls	-1
when my first shredder finally bit dust ( fellowes ) , i wanted upgrade more commercial series last longer , i spent 4-5 hours online researching shredders . fellowes kept coming top list customer comments ( price ) . i loved my earlier home office version ( which lasted 6 years moderate shredding until large hidden paperclip it ) so i'm partial fellowes anyway . but i looked everything out there . i didn't want spend fortune , but i wanted high quality metal parts . i also wanted move confetti type ; strip shredder filled up trashcan too often . this sb-97c it ! love it ! really grinds through everything - don't open up junk mail anymore . i shred through old tax files quickly - top piece provides " guide " so you know how much paper go through shredder once . it also guide cds credit cards i've found very handy . slide out trashcan really holds lot paper . it comes some oil few bags - very nice them include these get you started . i've only this month but i've shredded good amount paper it wonderful . price i highly recommend it	1

after close ten years using hp 4l , ( which still works perfectly ) , i decided look printer larger paper reserve higher speed . i've thrilled p2015dn . speed incredible , paper tray holds 250 sheets , front unit small indicator approximate amount paper left tray . 32 mb standard memory means big print job , even if paper runs out middle printing , it remember print remainder job . here great thing ... this model p2015 unit network ready built-in print server . i small network server connecting 2 computers wireless router our laptops . my 4l connected print server parallel cable . choosing this unit , all i use j45 ethernet cable , plug one end into one my ethernet hub empty ports , other end into back printer . install drivers each computer ( not server ) , you instantly business . just choose p2015dn your default printer each computer . i kept my existing setup my 4l backup printer just case . ) really nice surprise my ethernet hub old 10base-t , yet p2015dn still fires out each page blinding speed . machine doesn't make sound until it processed job , then starts firing pages out . duplexing works perfectly . extra money spent this dn model payed simplicity installation . there no operating manual comes box . there only installation disk . manual found hp web site . my only problem install instructions they tell you not turn machine until install complete , but it can't find machine network complete install unless machine , software not tell you specific point turn machine . so leap faith , i turned machine , it found network , install finished nicely . during install , it tell you it reboot your machine , so don't anything open while doing install . overall , based my experience my old 4l , current performance my new p2015dn , i look forward many years trouble free service . you tell i'm hp fan . yes , you find cheaper makes models same , but me , hp only dependable brand . i only say based personal experience ... i understand others may feel differently . good luck your printer purchase .	1

i wasn't exactly sure what think these speakers first . my setup includes pair these speakers , connected 6.5 " klipsch woofer ( gmx-a 2.1 ) $99 , i wasn't sure if i would get much more performance than stock sattelites klipsch 2.1 ; however , i'm very impressed after few days adjust differences sound . ( klipsch much more bright sounding , i liked , i adjusted equalizer my computer slightly more treble . after , i would say these speakers sound great any way you listen them ) . my personal opinion they sounded somewhat flat their own . i'm not sure how woofer attached would alter sound , but they seem nicely rounded their own . recommended anyone looking great price mid-range component .	1
i like design headset . it lightweight . way headset hangs your ear might feel little weird time time , but if you playing game your pc using this device voice comm you would probably ignore awkward feeling your ear after you get sucked into game . unfortunately , me , this device not deliver what it promised : 1 . - when you connect device windows use it preferred sound device . so when if you trying play game you using other comm software chat your teammates , instead using your primary sound device game lifechat sound device voice , windows switch lifechat sound device all sounds , which , my view defeats purpose headset . you get around this selecting your primary sound driver windows settings menu , but this pain . 2 . - sound very low muffled . mike buzzing background noise , lot feedback echo . i problems trying understand what my team mates say they barely understand me . poor sound quality renders this device useless . i wished it different ... generally speaking , i like ms products , but this one really disappointed me , specially since i looking forward get it so long .	-1
triplets , everything comes threes . my teens got sony erricson w300i phones christmas , i use this card drag drop their music our mac sound incredible . use mac itunes one needs download music mp3 format ( tunes bought itunes cannot converted ) . then open hard disk , open itunes , find music library . plug phone using usb port then just drag drop songs or albums into phone mp3 file ( seen when you open memory stick phone ) . all data there sounds good . kids no longer carrying their ipods they it all one device . access songs easy phone no lag	1

i'm very satisfied this case . but first bad : 1 ) it scratches easily . i handle my incased ipod kid gloves it still shows minor scratches surface . but anybody who 5g ipods knows ipod itself , especially black one shows lot scratches compared prior ipods . i think most people would prefer scraches your $25 case vs your ipod so i can't complain too much . 2 ) belt clip bit difficult use . it comes off case very easily . but when you use it , it difficult remove it your belt . that not say it can't it not issue should keep you this fine product . it task probably require both hands though . 3 ) opening connection bottom ipod might too large some . those you who like most possible coverage your ipod might little disappointed case , but those who prefer bigger opening so you easily attach accessories , this plus . now good ( my mind , there lot more good vs . bad ): thing made me purchase this one looks . only other case i've used evo iskin , which rubbery type substance seems act magnet all sorts dirt . i prefer showcase b/c clear face allows you show off ipod itself . personally , i really don't like cases hide ipod under flaps leather or mounds rubber . ipod beautiful piece machinery should treated such . hard surface not dirt problem i rubbery case . there rubber goes around edge add protection drops , but rest it clear . this case allows complete ease removing ipod which you simply moving two switches side case . headphone jack accessible enough able fit l-shaped headphones . all all , this great case , esp money . if you one those who prefer absolute most protection you ipod , then there may other options better you . i think there probably more sturdier cases ones provide more complete coverage ipod . this case great if you like able access ipod easily , use accessories case , show off beauty ipod .	1

this s350dl everything i need portable radio . powered d-cells which seem last forever , fm audio fabulous $150 radio long distant night time am band reception simply great . just tune well lit lcd display frequency if there anything it worth listening it there . selectivity tremendous bandwidth set narrow . i live almost next door powerful station 820khz like listen weak one several hundred miles away 810khz , not problem . no interference strong station . my scant no doubt obsolete communications theory always held great radio reception , double or even triple conversion receivers norm . now i radio advertised highly sensitive selective latest state art single conversion analog tuner circuitry . what means , i haven't clue but i'm impressed . only negative thing i've found radio so far its fine tuning knob tendency jump past frequency you're trying tune up , then , when you tune back down it jumps past downside . i've heard this called backlash . eventually you get lock exact frequency but it minor annoyance . thing takes some getting used i'm so used push button scanning type receivers , rotating old fashioned tuning knob several turns get high end band low trys my patience . overall i'm happy camper find this radio good features far outweigh its bad .	1

i am using my second zune , awesome . first one got broken almost day after i received it . amazon good job replacing item quickly possible . zen media player great , especially user interface ... makes it so easy navigate .. radio feature also great .. i usually turn it go sleep ... i guess navigation better than ipod .. i am not big ipod fan myself but navigation zune far easier ... click wheel would make things more easier but i guess thats patented so microsoft cannot copy ipod ... screen large but they should higher resolution .. would great ... but even this resolution videos pictures good qualityabout zune software ... it drawbacks but synchronizing songs not difficult .. but not great either ... i rather buy cds than music online so i don't care whether they thousand songs or zillion songs .. i just want their online music catalog updated so i get my media library tuned zune .. i am not big fan managing music itunes or media player or zune , softwares like foobar or mediamonkey make life lot easier manage library .. esp . when you massive one like me ( 60gb ) ... constant updates zune software get betterabout wireless feature , i can't find soul around who zune .. so i don't really care ... i no comments thatzune equalizer five or six different settings , which plus factor .. it user friendly since it customizable some extent battery , i read many reviews it poor battery , well new version firewall this problem solvedearphones zune sucks ... they didn't even fit my ear .. i am using sony earphone bose headphones ... although zune earphones looks cool metal so you stick two earphones together .... i question if microsoft people aware electricity magnet produce electromagnetic field whose fore harmful body ... esp . sensative part like brain ... until unless i am not confirmed this doesn't effect brain .. i am not using themi my homework properly , my biggest competitive zen vision ( reviews this far better than zune even ipod , cnet even gave zen some title , product year or something ) but i took risk trusting microsoft ( which not good bet ) , so far it working up expectation .. sad part i around . 4 gb left cheer	1

i am not going write what this phone what it doesn't , you read it other reviews . i explain what problems i you might it . least it might help you troubleshoot similar issues . first , it easy setup phone , connect it router phone line , register your skype name make your first land line call . quality good . then i placed skype call friend .. first problem : no audio , nobody hears anything . i tried use skype account my computer make calls to/from sph200d .. no audio . i looked all settings device , support website found nothing . i tried connect admin webpage using provided cd documentation username password admin admin couldn't connect(second problem ) . well , i reset base unit still couldn't connect admin page . i searched online god bless internet found documentation cd old current username/password admin/password . what even better reseting base unit helped audio problems ! hooray ! now i make good quality skype calls without need go downstairs my computer . next biggest problem i've experienced no matter automatic sign option turned phone(and web page ) asking password every time you sign off/sign skype . turning phone off , reseting base/phone , using different skype id , etc not help . i called support , waited 15 minutes told i need register product online first . well it sense , i so called again . 10 minutes later customer representative deli ready provide me excellent service . first , he said yes automatic sign should work my phone not defective , asked me all steps i already , i.e. reseting , etc . no luck . then he left check this issue called me back state phone must ask password every time i sign security reason ! ( what remember username/password option there ? ) . nice lie customer make him believe problem solved . note : if you turn phone off - yes there option turn it off , please press hold red button - without signing off , then when you turn phone it wouldn't ask you password . right , but all this time phone off , friends see your status online/away may try call you . well , there solution i've found myself - never sign off , just change your status offline . i not decided yet whether return/replace unit or keep it . maybe when you learn tricks how use device it would serve you well . but current price/quality i would not recommend it , too bad there not many alternatives . good luck it	-1

battery grip k10d helpful some situations . it holds back-up battery actually functional camera without swapped out main battery , thus doubling your battery time . you remove it , however , change main camera battery . storage space inside grip also holds second sd card . i would given 5 star rating if this card also functional , however , it not merely serves storage card . wireless remote control also stores battery grip but don't expect find one box . you purchase remote separately ! i am not sure grip needs quite so large size makes camera diffficult tote smaller camera bags , makes it cumbersome hang around your neck . second shutter release control dials extremely handy ! overall i think this very good product only minor drawbacks ! i highly reccomend it anyone purchasing k10	-1

what it designed , speakers top notch . pros : pros fairly obvious : space saving , great look , no cumbersome wiring , surround effect clearly separated , it not dependent room configuration . additional pro sound quality : mid range wonderful , jazz vocal sounds fullness you'd expect polk audio . treble crisp without breaking . all-in-all , sound sufficiently top-notch even someone who appreciates good sound systems ( except some you serious audiophiles ) . pro speakers strong enough handle enough power sizable room , say 20x20 room . cons : cons pretty obvious too . it not real surround , so it not give 360-degree feel sound field , but rather gives 180-degree feel . note you need add your own subwoofer sufficient power your room size . bottom line , i am very happy this purchase .	1

i installed this machine home office network via ethernet . install took awhile , changed registry settings without asking . uninstall not restore system it original state ; only hours manual resetting . how many users restore registry ? further , software/drivers not like printer turned off or missing . if you install this road laptop , you expect program , hpzinw12 . exe , search missing printer every 100 seconds or so using all available cpu time . if you unlucky enough middle client presentation , chances good you just lost job . if you turn off printer office , your office systems also search printer display unclosable dialog asking you switch unknown program while using most their available cpu time . ( please note 6 hidden dlls also running all times . ) this software totally equivalent virus except duplication . i returned this system never buy hp product	-1

long-time panasonic wet/dry shaver user , i've owned both high end low end shavers , including procurve , found closeness shave equal both . pricier razors need charging every week cheaper razors smaller , quieter lighter run several weeks charges . however , pricier razors also sealed against water intrusion much better last 5 or 6 years , less expensive ones start failing due leakage year or two . ( but price , who cares ? ) order get close shave these babies , secret shave shower when skin pores open . that why panasonic electric razors class themselves . when wet , they shave least close razor without risk cuts . ( when dry , their closeness no better than any other brand . ) money i didn't spend high priced model provided me good excuse also invest very nice nimh one hour battery charger enough high capacity nimh 2700 mah batteries ( thomas-distributing.com)to end my dependance disposable aa alkaline batteries forever . razor run tad slower 1.2 volt nimh batteries than 1.5 volt alkalines , but still works just fine . great little razor ridiculously low price . when other razor companies get message ?	1
i review this simply because it not great . noice cancelling its job , sound quality ok , but little bass side , but way headphones sat your head just uncomfortable . its plastic head thing folds nicely into pouch annoying because crack which you fold headphones sometimes gets your haird caught it pulls it out when taking them off . me glasses , i often readjust headsets often because they push sides my glasses my head too much , causing discomfort . so me readjust them , i often pull out hairs ! just plasticky hard feel them--it just not comfy . i'll admit i got quite bargain ten bucks this item , but i would never pay 40 bucks headphones like these , especially without cushioned headband others , cheaper prices , often offer .	-1
i could not find this product stores anymore because all mp3 players out now ; i would guess . i bought these recording store they must not regular discs they sent me gold ones . better yet ! i stocked up this time around	1
install set up bit confusing . contact tech . support ( not real friendly or warm ) . we looking save time data entry . we realized much frustration typing faster more accurate . when scanning e-mail addresses error rate 40% font size 6 . scanning 8 above error rate went down 25% . correcting errors pen made took more time then it worth . concept great but need allot improvement .	-1
i read many customer reviews before buying this gps . now i see many things mentioned reviewers differ my personal experience . here what i noticed so far : 1 . maps : appear quite accurate . this writing , i not experience any problems maps . i doubt paper maps would more accurate , or updated more frequently . 2 . updates : i recently downloaded installed version 3.11 , no problems during or after installation . 3 . battery : not great , but quite reasonable . after all , it car gps , so most time it plugged anyway . if you need ac adapter , i suggest buying ac 12v converter instead . ( this what i ) . it more universal used power other units ( coolers , car phone chargers , etc . ) ac outlet . 4 . satellite reception tracking : no complains here . 5 . menus other ui : nothing horrible . when you get used it , it becomes comfortable . 6 . music player , photo viewer : imo absolutely useless . ( same bluetooth , which not build into this unit , some people complain ) . you really no better way playing your music or answering your phone calls ? then it pity . honestly , i am not sure why they even bother building all this functionality into car gps unit . still , it works , it not true you need proprietary software or specially formatted sd cards it . i used windows explorer standard sd card copy mp3 files my laptop play it my gps ( no magellan software ) . summary : good gps unit , especially price ( i got mine under $300 ) . if you need navigation computer , consider buying gps antenna your laptop , then carry it you all time :) . me , it enough not get lost unknown city , finally get where i wanted . plus , it quite cool know how far you destination , how long it take you get there , even if you know route heart	-1

this perfect width stand 46 " hdtv . it hangs it very secure would also good 52 " screens , although 52 " , set noticeably wider than stand . glass shelves themselves surprisingly strong tempered glass supposedly support up 50lbs , though you probably would not put large size amp/receiver it . however , it seems strong enough support my large 25 lb center speaker , which thanks adjustable shelves , i am able elevate it only half inch under my tv which ideal movie watching . i worried first center spkr might too heavy but it sitting pretty it 3 weeks now . i used wider sized glass top shelf accomdate my extra wide center spkr my dvd player glass shelf below it . my receiver sits base stand i always rest easy knowing receiver plenty ventaliation thanks open design adjustable height shelves . pole itself one solid piece extruded alumimum thick very well constructed . it probably strongest piece kit . base also reinforced metal framing underneath mdf wood base , so there no worries either base or pole failing . only thing not impressive black finish base which quite nice look shiny , but you tell layer lacquer used quite thin could wear out over time or chip easily if you're not careful . also , due finish glass shelves , there visible dust buildup after week or so . this project mostly 1 man project , but you probably need 2 people when it comes time mounting your bigscreen lcd or plasma stand anything 42 " or bigger . tools required phillips screwdriver wrench 6 large screws base where pole sits . rest screws all use allen wrenches which provided . also word advice glass shelves . try not put anything heavy made out metal or ceramic directly glass surface . while their structure quite strong , tempered glass easily shatter into thousands if pieces you knock it something made metal/cermamic . if you want put anything metal or ceramic it , then make sure it rubber feet or something	1

we bought everyone family one these christmas . wind it up power away . cell phone charger converters come it fit most cell phones family , but it not fit fire fly or newer nokia ( model fm radio capacity ) . but it fits other nokias sony ericson . we've lost power here st. louis twice 2006 days . we no radio , no tv , no bateries , nada . now , we prepared . it pick up tv somewhat , but this not what we got it . if there huge national crisis i doubt tv towers , stations , power outages support any tv or radio . but we light . flashlight not brightest , but it sufficient . when power goes out sund goes down , it dark . we feel better knowing we won't rely candles batteries . we bought orange white ones . they plasticy i wonder how long windy thing last , but careful use this radio certainly come handy until ameren ue tunes lights	1
i thought i monophonic purist until seeing consumer reports review rated sound quality kloss tivoli radio above even bose , boston acoustic , cambridge models providing it hooked up satellite speaker . so fifty bucks , why not ? speakers nightstands parallel my head , so sound hardly balanced . other hand , it kind cool hear trombone coming one side bed oboe other . so thumbs up extra speaker , though i'm not go crazy install kloss sub-woofer underneath bed . not only it over-priced but even without sub-woofer speakers , my ears , already bass-heavy . maybe i'll reconsider if my cat stops purring prospect vibrating mattress suddenly seems attractive .	-1
it fits under my tv perfectly . dark gray matches tv so it practically invisible . , most important , it swivels smoothly , doing job it designed .	1
checking other reviews here amazon showed everyone either loved this western digital drive ( gave it 5 stars ) if it worked or else they blackballed it if it failed . prices these drives continue fall , since larger drives ( 500 gb well even 1000 gb ) now available , they really good buy excellent way externally store well transfer data . my experience this drive very easy install , reformat , use extra drive . no problems . only thing i really don't like fact it doesn't real on/off button . circle front turn off power , but whenever computer starts , this drive starts well . means unless drive manually turned off after computer starts , drive always when computer . i prefer drive only when i need it save it unnecessary wear tear . other external drives maxtor even other western digital drives real on/off switches . this drive make noticeable hum while running	-1

people saying years tapes would die , but fortunately , they never seem . i know number people who car stereo both cd cassette . matter , i am starting see cassette walkmans again . if you follow my reviews , you know because dangers cd rot , i prefer make tapes my cds use them when possible . those you who don't know cd rot , it capable wiping out whole collection cds . what happens heat moisture turn cd purple make it unreadable . ( extreme cases , holes cd prevalent . ) if your cds not so over top , they may actually transfer well onto normal bias cassettes such maxell ur or tdk . previous reviewer pointed out if you making tapes your cds use your car , lot times normal bias cassette suffice , since most car stereo speakers not designed high output . ( he called maxell ur perfect workhorse tape . ) but moving high quality tdk sa tape , these tapes superb capable holding material even high intense cds such " metallica " ' ride lightning , ' " megadeth " ' rust peace , ' or " exodus " ' tempo damned . ' i'll conclude saying tdk sa not only give you excellent travel friendly copies your cds , but using them when you travel keep your cds safe cd rot .	1

i picked these up compusa which closing many it stores . yes there fan noise but what you expect it raid . you writing reading data very fast rate would you rather fry drives ? drive not need sit right next you . set it farther back if it bothers you . if you want hear what real fan noise sit server room few hours configuring multiple drive raids few dozen servers around you . what i call fan noise . this thing nothing . it provides redundancy ( raid 1 ) very good cost point . personally i would only recommend raid 1 . if you run raid 0 loose one drive you loose all your data . this not raid 5 which allow you loose one drive keep going . so my advice if you need fast large amounts storage fail over ( raid 1 ) then this product you .	1
i would recomend these phones , especially anyone who invested $250+ mp3 player ( you may well listen well ! ) . they're collapsable , which makes traveling easy sound still great . much better alternative ear buds which more potential damage ear drums or cause other discomfort . they also come stereo head those us musically inclined who use amps . i wouldn't reccomend them use while running or other exercise beyond walking , but style , comfort , quality sound i give both thumbs up !	-1
i've htpc hobbyist few years , westinghouse lvm-42w2 far away best " tv " i've seen purpose . it hard describe how crystal-clear picture over dvi input , or how blissful it native 1080p straight your pc without any overscan all , without just setting up so-called " 1080p " set alongside . so far , set rock-solid consistently attractive . remote sluggish generally unattractive , but that afterthought htpc users anyway . this my biggest complaint tv should tell you something	1

i previous bad experience all-in-ones , but bought this i liked bw laser network feature ( got it during sale half price ) . i liked it so much i recommended it client , who replaced her aging fax machine . copy ability , sheet feeder , great , scanner works very well , even over network , everything seamlessly works macintosh windows computers ( i two macs windows box ) . scanning resolution good enough almost everything 600x600 . main downside , why it got 4 stars not 5 , reliability . my machine arrived malfunctioning copier . page would come out badly distorted . amazon sent new one , no hassles , i sent old one back . one i bought client staples , after she 6 weeks , it started problems . faxes wouldn't come out unless you turned it off again . no warning lights - just wouldn't work . when it came back , faxes saved memory last few days would spit out . frustratingly , when we called hp this , our warranty allowed us mail it them , wait 3 weeks , then they would send us same one back repaired . no thank you - i didn't buy machine without it 3 weeks . expedited option , which cost $50 , them send new one we would send old one back . they would ship new one next day air - after 2 week backlog . no thanks either ! so , buy machine it great machine , but keep your receipts , or consider otherwise evil extended warranty , there good chance this problems within few months	-1

i really liked idea this product , they some good templates , but after putting hours into designing book writing up captions , i printed it pictures looked horrible . software resizes images automatically fit layout , but some reason leaves pictures pixelated fuzzy . i took pictures 6mp camera , they look great when viewed computer or printed other software , but when this software resized them they came out terrible . there really no way around it , except try guess proper resolution each photo crop resize yourself before inserting photos , but would take several more hours . this product wasted hours my time left me very disappointed	-1
