carr provides stirring indictment belief it brings it promise competitive advantage . instead , he posits it merely cost doing business , cut same cloth other innovations once held lot promise like electricity railway system . though no company ever hope operate much less compete without above , its homogeneity prevalence somehow blunted its value . search elusive silver bullet found ceo bequeathing so much power it good number expected it rescue bad business plans . carr mentions specific examples it inability mask business problems but rather makes them more apparent earlier . one major point i find hard believe window innovation it closed . though lot strides made , lot work yet . however , i fear carr would proven prescient even seminal this particular point short term . though it people continue churn out next line killer applications , there danger customers may simply refuse upgrade or purchase thereby sealing it fate commodity . interesting thought gleaned book it ( automation ) frees people far more important tasks . however , what those important tasks not clearly defined . granting most tasks automated , it lead more unemployment , surplus products ( assuming productivity rises because it ) , low prices profits until next new thing discovered disrupt balance once again . but this hasn't happened ye t.t hough i don't agree some carr ideas , i believe it good read dissenting opinions future it .	1

tropic cancer henry miller . not recommended . his 1960 introduction tropic cancer , karl shapiro said , " i call henry miller greatest living author because i think he , " " . . . spiritual example he stands among great men our age , " " . . . he [ orwell ] predicts miller set pace attitude novelist future . this not happened yet , but i agree it must . " shapiro not support any these points his essay , nothing tropic cancer supports them , either . tropic cancer consists 318 pages recounting miller experience american expatriate paris expounding his personal philosophy , often ways rambling painfully nonsensical . miller stories his friends tedious , pointless , catty ; like miller , they seem talentless hacks whose belief their own artistic abilities makes them artists writers , though believing . miller writes , " year ago , six months ago , i thought i artist . i no longer think it , i am " -- which type arrogant pretentiousness he mocks virtually all his acquaintances . when they not creating , or talking philosophy or creating , miller his circle seem spend nearly every moment picking up women ( disease ) . they rarely use neutral term such " woman " when there so many obscene , demeaning words which objectify gender . women miller friends find invariably portrayed stupid , drunken , irrational , loose , sly , deceptive , good primarily one function , which miller turns into squalid , cold , joyless act . spite all vice " living , " no one seems fun , some characters , notably fillmore , find themselves nearly trapped into bourgeoisie life . miller expresses contempt machine , industrial age , money -- although he schemes keep 2,800 francs fillmore mistress revels so much his pocket . often hungry , miller obsesses food relies his friends support him . when he describes his indian friend kepi " . . . scrounger , sort human tick who fastens himself hide even poorest compatriot , " he could talking himself he bitterly complains those his friends who stingy money , accommodations , food , wine . miller logic working world facile ; he writes , " if you want bread , you've got get harness , get lockstep . " surface , this true , but it never seems occur him , if you want bread , someone must cultivate , raise , harvest wheat produce other components ; someone must transform these components into bread ; someone must deliver it shops cafes . other words , if most people weren't " lock step , " miller could choose starve or set himself produce bread , joining world harness . he makes his choice clear , then whines it . he may despise those who support him , whether they friends or workers , but perhaps because he , misanthrope who finds fault everyone but himself , needs very people he denigrates ( including " grocer , baker , shoemaker , butcher , etc . -- all imbecilic-looking clodhoppers " ) , reliance which he resents . he hates machine machine mind , but offers no alternatives . seemingly incapable sincere feeling , miller finds human emotion amusing . when friend says , " boy break your heart . . . he so damned beautiful ! so cruel ! " miller writes , " we laugh this . it sounded preposterous . but collins earnest . " when acquaintance whom he owes money dies , he writes , " any rate , he killed automobile accident shortly after my arrival , circumstance which left me twenty-three francs good . " shapiro claims miller poet , but his attempts poetic philosophic ramblings often make little if any sense . speaking buildings statues , miller says , " . . . they must saturated my anguish , " kind bad metaphor which he frequently indulges . he describes artists such himself " inhuman ones . " " i am inhuman ! i say it mad , hallucinated grin , i keep saying it though it rain crocodiles . behind my words all those grinning , leering , skulking skulls , some dead grinning long time , some grinning if they lockjaw , some grinning grimace grin , foretaste aftermath what always going . " whenever these attempts poetic philosophy appeared , rambling pages , i found myself yearning return his insipid stories prostitutes , disease , friends , hunger . tropic cancer perhaps worst book i ever read ( i promise myself i would read tropic capricorn ) . shapiro says , " there not many these emancipated beings left our world [ emancipated what ? -- dls ] , these clowns clairvoyants , celebrants soul flesh still-remaining promise america . " if miller , his whining , his criticism , his holier-than-everyone attitude , his " art , " his two-dimensional view people , his obsession excrement , " greatest " these souls , may i never meet least . note : if there 0 stars option , tropic cancer would earned it	-1
it through alistair cockburn earlier writings i ' got it ' good people , not methodologies tools , deliver successful projects . although crystal clear meant only small teams ( there crystal color every size team ) , properties , practices , principles , examples techniques this book would benefit any software development team . subtitle begins " human-powered methodology ...

unlike most science-related books , there only few pages within this biography dealt diagrams equations . majority novel consisted stunning information regarding life mind james clerk maxwell , who often forgotten general public favor more prolific figures such joule farraday . although i'll go far admit high schooler , this type literature not my favorite , i surprised find this book captivated imagination allowed insight not just into work but into mind maxwell . research purposes , this book contains very useful index efficient easy fact-finding . furthermore , technical diagrams equations explained very well , sufficient time patience could understood . most amazing maxwell life career . his early entry into science math ( age 16 ) both awesome inspiring . basil mahon brings maxwell achievement into plain view ease language interesting style writing so rarely found science books today	1
all poems smooth clever slightly ( or more than slightly ) ironic . they sometimes make me smile , but they seldom make me feel much . i recently poetry reading collins gave , where he greatly applauded . he mentioned sentimentality cardinal sin poetry . that true . but i couldn't emotionally connect self-consciously witty voices speaking out his poems , end this collection i didn't really want . when i first read collins , i hoping find accessible poet illuminating everyday world i promised . instead , i found extremely polished poet whose engaging tone almost makes up his persistent lack emotional depth . sentimentality may poetic sin , but sincerity isn't . even funny poems should display little emotional risk . but collins never seems risk anything . because he takes small risks , we get small rewards . go ahead get this book . read it . smile bit . appreciate cleverness talent collins displays . these poems likeable , i wouldn't surprised if you liked them . but if you looking poetry feed you , go somewhere else	-1

this book one worst cases feminist propaganda male bashing i ever chance review . this book loaded problems present society author seems make sure it blamed sports men who participate sports . if you where looking well balanced text sports look else where because you find no other opinion but authors feminist this book . major reason i not like this book because it blames men everything wrong makes sports out just this real evil event we participate . much information this book dated well much case studies primarily 50s , 60s , 70s , which makes much information irrelevant . it ignores any other point view completely biased dishonest book passes its information off absolutes but rarely backs up any its claims . this feminist propaganda book plain simple should not considered anything else	-1

king certainly lends high-profile this collection latter-day noir writing tough-guy procedurals , but i believe he created something little too far outside readership expected genre this series . setting characters recognizable ( now trite ? ) staples his beloved maine coast , he works bringing their " down east " mannerisms life language rings " bert i " lobstermen . i wasn't particularly caught up aged newspapermen tale their quest identify mysterious dead man found local beach . ending ... well , um ... ending definitely open-ender . king cleverly covers himself adding disclaimer sorts story won't appeal many readers . yep . you got right , stephen . no gunplay , no boozers , no saucy dames , no double-crosses , no slangy patter , no real satisfaction me . i suggest hard crime afficionados skip this entry look some heavy-hitters past	-1

this sermon all grace -- inconceivable grace holy patient god . we live " god love " age , where loving father grace would never ever put someone hell because their " weakness " . that what jehovah witnesses believe , that what modern christians come believe too . we adopted this ultragracious innocuous image god , i believe , two principle reasons : 1 ) we like selectively read scriptures . negating hell judgment passages more tolerable " god graceful loving " ones , we reconstruct our own likeness into god who now become eternal " good god " no emotions but love giving helping blessing -- god who advocates our carnal lifestyles , only worthy notice during christmas easter holidays , when devastation hits our lives . 2 ) we rationalize his character our own human standards . we ascribe certain attributes god logical us , what we deem fair . after all , isn't god all justice ? mercy ? no earthly judge would ever consign man fiery torture lifetime -- nevermind eternity ! this , we therefore decide , no way accurate image god . we'll often recite scriptures where jesus forgave woman caught adultery , or compassion multitudes , or ate dinner sinners , or preached sermon mount loving your enemies not repaying evil evil . yes , he all -- jesus christ , prince peace . many say here , " yep . jesus ' sermon mountain didn't scare people , it all love grace good things , blessings givings so forth ... " just like moon " dark " side , there also side god . jesus talked , warned , pleaded , wept it . awful justice holy eternal god . jesus talked more his father justice punishment wicked than his love righteous . god doesn't fool around sin . if he annihilated sodom gomorrah fire because their sexual immorality , his own son nailed cross , you really believe he'll spare any man or women who stands before him " awful day " unrepentant sin ? all throughout old new testaments , his prophets warned impending day fire wrath . joel called it " terrible day lord " , paul called it " judgment seat christ " , john called it " lake fire " , jesus called it " place eternal torment " , john baptist called it " day wrath " . david spoke it pslams ! every one " love scripture " you throw me , i give you three which warn god reserved wrath wicked . you tell me god loves sinner , but hates sin . but bible says god hates sinner well ( see psalm 5:4 ) . bible also says god angry wicked every day ( see psalm 7:11 ) . if you've read my review thus far , you're probably angry . this may indication you either : 1 ) don't know full character god , or 2 ) sin doesn't grieve your heart like it grieves holy spirit , or 3 ) you've never born again spirit desire holiness purity which , according bible , only acceptable lifestyle before god . jonathan edwards puritan preacher . these guys after purity ( hence , puritan ) holiness lord . today , 250 years later , we lost sight this . today , gospel jesus christ politically-correct , inoffensive , recreational powerless motivational philosophy success gain . gospel no power change lives because we refuse live holiness reverential fear awesome terrible god . we've instead created our own god our own ideals contructed his character out our own acceptable worldly attributes centered around our own standards success , comfort , tolerance . we need truth come back pulpits . away all unctionless motivational speaking passes gospel preaching today . when jonathan edwards preached his sermon 1741 , people fell out their chairs cried out , " what must we saved ! " fear god them shaking , weeping , pleading ! some even clutching pillars held gallery up , fearful ground split open swallow them whole ! anything like happen sinners your church last sunday ? mine neither .	1

i love clif bars , especially " carrot cake " flavor ! when i saw this book ceo founder company , i picked it up right away . it always insightful read people who founded or run companies get inside look how they built organization what they value . where most business books focus financials , strategy how successful their market , it rarer find company very successful financially while still placing their values higher priority than profit-at-all-costs culture plagues many organizations . book describes detail founding company , almost storybook beginnings his moms kitchen . what started desire create " sports bar " didn't taste like dirt , turned into quality well known brand . while these types rags riches stories may sounding familiar , this path actually quite different . gary describes his passions biking , travel climbing , how he learned value environment focus his company sustainable growth . when his competitors becoming part large conglomerates resources outspend out market his brand , he resisted lure millions sell company chose remain private . i found myself marking pages , pondering quotes , admiring spirit values gary brought organization . he describes difference " red path " " white path " . developed through analogy taking roads less traveled , traveling light his numerous bike trips europe , he discovers real joy journey not destination . those who take " white path " play it safe , make kinds business decisions accountants love . those who take " red path " stay true their values , must sometimes take risks others would fear order ensure vision upheld . those who enjoy business strategy , book contains plenty . steps business sustainability values hiring right people creating right culture employees outlined described . also , like howard shultz few others , gary chooses honest his doubts , his mistakes , his fears . this way , book more inspiring than typical academic controlled business planning tools most consultants business leaders use replace passion leadership . i recommend this book highly . if you feel there something missing your company , workplace become unending unsatisfying grind , then prepare inspired encouraged . it refreshing know there still business leaders who understand life more than their balance sheet . great example company willing give back community try make world better place . company leader who not only believe their employees inherent value human beings , but treat them such .	1

despite president bush declaration he wanted bin laden " dead or alive , " hunted world mightiest military last five years , osama remains large shrouded mystery . nor osama become " " - 2003 saw more significant terror attacks than any year within past 20 , while 2004 brought doubling again . thus , bush 3/02 claim bin laden marginalized no basis fact . nor osama accomplishments limited 9/11 . within four years osama cnn declaration war against u.s. his organization bombed two u.s. embassies africa , attacked u.s.s. cole yemen , helped drive u.s. out somalia , course , wtc attack - more damage u.s. than soviet union during nearly five decades cold war . every day osama remains large propaganda victory al qaeda . we need understand bin laden , not confused our own propaganda - eg . he never expressed interest attacking west because our " freedoms . " ( fact , bergen book includes direct osama quote refuting point - suggesting if so , one should wonder why he hadn't attacked sweden . ) peter bergen draws interviews over 50 individuals who known bin laden personally , plus his own interview . number written video materials , including ten years jihad magazine , also utilized . material presented objective manner , invaluable one wanting better understand bin laden his motives - both prior 9/11 , through iraq war . " oral history " begins osama early days . his father very , very anti-israel . he educated good school , very polite ( attribute maintained into adulthood ) , but not stand-out student . osama also quite religious , even his youth . rather than inheriting $200-$300 million fortune , bergen believes more credible figure around $20 million ( there 53 siblings which share ) . 1979 soviet invasion afghanistan shocked bin laden , thousands other devout young muslims - it first time since wwii non-muslim power invaded muslim country . bin laden involvement began donor , then holy warrior . most who knew his military involvement scornful , seeing he no military skills probably simply creating martyrs . further , bergen concludes osama impact very limited - number afghans fighting soviets varied 175-250 , 000 , while number arabs involved any point no more than few hundred , split several groups . thus , " real " outcome determined afghans themselves , together aid provided $3 billion u.s. aid ( no evidence any it went afghan arabs ) , additional support saudi arabia . bin laden victory vs . russians jaji ' 87 only p.r. accomplishment involving 50-60 arabs ( including bin laden ) over 22 day period . osama also spent six months building road through tora bora mountains ' 87 ( jaji jalalabad ) , gaining familiarity undoubtedly benefited when u.s. invaded 2001 . ayman al zawahiri , bin laden chief deputy , radicalized three years ' imprisonment torture egypt , part reaction sadat assassination ( not involved ) . he got osama focus not only afghan jihad , but also regime change arab world ( ousting repressive secular regimes , which also supported u . . ) . after soviets left afghanistan ' 89 country slipped into civil war - first drive out communist regime left behind , then various afghan factions . osama washed his hands area moved sudan . while there osama journeyed back saudi arabia made speeches against both u.s. ( its support moving one million russian jews israel ) saddam hussein . he even volunteered services his afghan arab veterans , plus new recruits , repel hussein kuwait - turned down preference more americans " last straw " osama - he turned against saudi royal family , ultimately his citizenship revoked . drug monies offered support osama efforts - he declined , not wanting " profit " blood innocent people . this point osama four wives - three university lecturers spinsters whom he married support islamic principles . osama opposed ' 92 landing 28,000 americans somalia food relief , seeing it part larger american strategy take over islamic world . same time , ramzi yousef masterminded ' 93 wtc bombing - he trained al qaeda camp . bomb itself cost $ 20,000 ; rationale u.s. support israel . osama repeatedly challenged actions killed children other innocents . his response reference u.s. atomic bombing nagasaki hiroshima , well purported loss one million iraqi children due u . . -supported sanctions . bergen also reports prior 9/11 afghan used gofer both osama british cameraman wanted help tell u.s. al qaeda planning hijack jets u.s. secure release " blind sheikh " held wtc bombing . fbi ended up both delaying his movement thailand meeting him - until after 9/11 . bergen states bin laden not involved 9/11 details ( nor those cole , etc . bombings ) . nonetheless , he ultimate commander , knew plans , supported effort . bergen also believes bin laden made serious error projecting u.s. reaction - he hoped , based prior u.s. actions eg . lebanon , u.s. would withdraw middle east , or invade afghanistan become bogged down protracted guerrilla war . instead , u.s. used 300 special forces troops ground , massive airpower , northern alliance forces quickly defeat al qaeda . " osama ... i know " also presents credible information knowledgeable sources refute rumor osama suffers form acute kidney disease - just low blood pressure foot wound incurred fighting soviets . bergen rather critical u.s. vs . osama escape afghanistan . sources clearly place bin laden there ( including bin laden himself ) only 300 others - yet he got away . bergen claims there more american journalists scene than u.s. soldiers . " acquiring nuclear chemical weapons religious duty " - osama , ' 99 . bergen sources , however , doubtful than osama any success acquiring nuclear capability , though he apparently scammed effort . osama opposed efforts foment civil war shia sunni , reports bergen ; meanwhile , zarqawi not join al qaeda until ' 04 - two years after sec . powell claimed iraq harboring zarqawi major al qaeda figure his effort justify invading iraq . bergen sees greater danger future iraq " foreign fighters " after iraq struggle than their afghan counterparts . rationale - their experience fighting stronger u.s. army focus urban strategies ( ieds suicide bombers ) . bergen also makes strong criticism u.s. intelligence efforts . he notes there over 30 audio videotapes bin laden his chief deputy post 9/11 , one guaranteed method finding them tracing back their chain custody . even knowing tape would likely delivered al jazeera pakistan bureau prior 2004 election u.s. failed stake out scene . thus , our $30+ billion proven totally inadequate . finally , bergen also quite critical bin laden strategies-to-date , noting his efforts remake muslim world not succeeded - u.s. more involved than ever . further , taliban ahs destroyed . bergen believes without u.s. invasion iraq fragmented islam militant movement would imploded year or so post 9/11 . bottom line : al qaeda no attractive vision world it seeks create - best it associated creating taliban-like control over other muslims	1
i admire ishiguro writing risk-taking book , most unlike any i read befire . unfortunately , this novel fails its objectives , except itself unique piece fiction . protagonist english detective , who appears completely delusional his current circumstances , who willing take these delusions great lengths . because this , plot eventually becomes irrelevant reality . this when book shows its signs brilliance , when plot recognized meaningless major themes take over chinese battle . unfortunately this brilliant culmination hardly makes up rest novel . besides poor/meaningless plot , novel not single character reader cares . thematic sequence , during which book finally seems something , all too fleeting . soon after plot returns even more absurd than before . it truly frustrating experience	-1

jamie written nice book subject mind mapping . her book replete examples variety situations , including moving one person who terminal illness . there excellent guidelines how mind map . short , person could learn use this excellent tool without any additional books , or even software . her book much lower hype index than buzan books . problem i jamie book she calls her mind maps something different -- idea maps . now could very well because " mind maps " trademarked term . but she should candid enough admit . there some attempt differentiating two concepts , but differences seem rather contrived . subject visual colorful mind mapping , there exactly zero color pages depicting mind maps . business book twenty five dollar list price , author publisher could bound few pages containing maps full color . impact her message would much greater way . quibble there number mind maps purportedly too large printed . reader directed web site download mind maps . these could easily included cd back book , which contains trial software commercial vendor . great idea would include mind map her book cd . these quibbles aside , i consider " idea mapping " great introduction mind mapping . no new ground broken , but nevertheless , it worthy introductory text . beginning readers might also wish consider tony buzan " mind map book " which full color , covers same ground	1

coming panzer leader , i didn't know much eastern front . after reading it , i great grip what happened why . guderian writes short , succinct , declarative prose , which makes reading breeze . readers not interested fine details may put off sheer depth guderian account , but those passages dense only because sheer volume information guderian relays , not his writing style . german high command gets once over , particularly interesting guderian character sketches hitler goering . i not know enough guderian judge his flat denial any knowledge pertaining final solution or einsatztruppe , but sheer military point view you can't any better than panzer leader . guderian walks reader through conquests poland france , through army group center involvement operation barbarossa . he never hesitates point out where he disagreed general staff , describes detail his frustration okh okw . especially interesting early parts book where guderian describes his efforts get tanks accepted german command viable force battlefield , subsequent formation panzer divisions . this easily one best books i ever read , definitely one most informative . i learned ton reading this , loved every page it . those not interested military history probably find it dense hard get through , though . i'm giving it 5 stars despite drawback - this book simply indispensable military history enthusiasts wwii buffs	1

i hate alex portnoy , protragonist novel , yet i couldn't stop reading this book . me , that sign talented writer . main character few , if any , redeeming characteristics . he egomaniac . he inconsiderate . he obsessed sex . he nasty human almost every way , yet ( long you're not easily offended ) you can't stop reading him . " portnoy complaint " written if it words patient confessing his shrink . portnoy wants know what wrong himself , but before he find out he shares his life story childhood his mid-thirties , vast majority his story revolves around his relationship his parents , jewish , his obsession sex . i think what makes portnoy fascinating there probably little bit him every man , though few us may comfortable admitting it . so it interesting read him male perspective . female perspective i'd imagine he would interesting character if only because he shows just how depraved man . i guarantee after reading book you'll able identify least one portnoy your life -- someone who wasted their talents selfish pursuits , yet they so egotistical they blame their shortcomings everyone else , including their parents . this book ridiculously funny because no matter how absurd it gets , you can't help but realize it all too close truth	1
here it , final book creator/writer grant morrison invisibles series . books 1-3 collected volume 1 , books 4-6 collected volume 2 , book 7 collects volume 3 its entirety . previous two volumes over twenty issues each , but volume 3 only 12 issues , something which seems spark much debate , these days . i seen many claims volume 3 only 12 issues due low sales , dc/vertigo requested morrison wrap up his series half time , cut costs . this simply not true . volume 3 morrison full vision ; nothing cut out due editorial constraints . here morrison exact words , shortly before beginning volume 3 : " volume 3 appear three four-part arcs-`satanstorm ' ; `karmageddon ' `the invisible kingdom'- 1999 . then it all i go off my mid-life crisis tibet . there some fears this may not work `sales ' dealt permanent blow , but i prefer faith all you wunnerful people out there who've stayed bus so far , i'd like think you'd rather see invisibles completed intended than me hack it out meet monthly deadline . " it final book series , you might expect invisible kingdom answer questions end long journey . unfortunately , you would mistaken . fact , most volume 3 doesn't even feel like invisibles we know love . where volume 1 slow-paced focused characterization , volume 2 focused action metaphysics , volume 3 seems like totally different series . main cause this invisibles themselves relegated supporting-character status ; mr. six his division pals archvillain sir miles delacourt instead get most " screen time , " king mob , jack , fanny reduced small parts . make things worse , when morrison feature invisibles , instead using characters we already know , he instead tortures us new invisible named helga , who probably most annoying character series . morrison obviously doesn't think so , however , he gives helga just every " cool " line " outrageous " action he think , attempt make her cutting edge . instead , she comes off annoyingly pretentious bore , it doesn't help morrison fails give her any sort background or emotional makeup . what makes this all more frustrating he uses this character so much , totally ignores more interesting female invisibles ragged robin boy . it like morrison ran out ideas main characters , come up someone new carry plot ; problem , he couldn't chosen worse lead character . said , book 7 picks up mr. six division , last seen book 3 : " entropy uk . " they're still hot trail miles delacourt monstrous " future king " england . meanwhile , mr. six strives help his teammates remember they're actually undercover invisibles agents . addition this , six helga attempt deprogram sir miles . while this going , jack frost africa jolly roger , where he comes closer realizing his buddhahood . king mob mostly out picture , off meditating india , trying rid himself need kill . after laying rest 99 year-old invisible edith , king mob et al reunite final showdown miles delacourt demonic archons he serves . this culminates satanic crowning monstrous king august 11 , 1999 , horrific ceremony which entails butchering children homeless victims . instead action scene volume 2 , events play out more lines mystical denouement volume 1 , jack frost once again proving he most powerful human alive . above two paragraphs make events volume 3 sound rather simplistic . this not case . i mentioned , since this final volume series , one might expect morrison answer questions . instead , he chooses make volume 3 opaque difficult possible . even dialog doesn't help sort things out ; characters don't talk each other , they trade " i'm too cool " banter . what makes this all more grating morrison so obviously taken his themes plots works robert anton wilson terrence mckenna ; but unlike those authors , who always guide reader through their labyrinthine visions , morrison instead tosses everything into blender hopes it all comes out " cool . " therefore , chance any emotional impact pretty much lost . volume 3 saved final story series , " glitterdammerung . " fully illustrated frank quitely , this possibly single best issue invisibles . previous 11 issues volume 3 wrapped up series storyline , but it up " glitterdammerung " explain what series itself all . set 2012 , story operates more metaphysical look back series than linear tale . it tie up several subplots , also ends series defiantly anarchic note , jack frost frees himself confines comic itself . this story alone gives book 7 4-star rating . secret revealed book 7 this ( avoid this paragraph if you hate spoilers , though if you know this , it probably wouldn't " spoil " anything , anyway ! ) : invisibles game , one played someone ( john a'dreams ? jack frost ? you ? ) . toward very end series , several characters begin figure this out , most notably john a'dreams , white-suited former invisible who disappeared before events book 1 : " say you want revolution . " idea invisibles reality-model experienced those who wish gain gnosis ; hence many , many times phrase " remember . it just game " stated throughout books 1-6 . this entails characters realizing they not only works fiction , but each them might even same person , only playing different characters , or " suits , " one enlightened character calls them . i've always felt this morrison skewed way interpreting gnostic " all one " belief , all humans share one collective , unconscious soul - aka " god . " art volume 3 mess . volume 1 invisibles plagued succession artists , some good , some terrible . volume 2 corrected this big way . unfortunately volume 3 goes back volume 1 territory , only it worse . instead different artists handling different story arcs , multiple artists work same story . this terrible idea morrison part , i think it backfired him , art so underwhelming some places dc/vertigo certain pages re-illustrated this collection . book 7 starts off promising enough , philip bond warren pleece cartoonish art , but then it quickly falls pieces when " multiple artist " scenario rears its head . quitely saves day end however , his art " glitterdammerung " just phenomenal his work morrison " flex mentallo . " special mention must also made brian bolland cover art this trade paperback . he " remixed " 12 original covers he volume 3 ; one particular , " sgt pepper " send-up , would make perfect poster . even though this review mostly negative , book 7 still required reading all those who made it this far . morrison finishes series fashion he intended start , character arcs unique inspiring . example , what other work fiction would feature character like king mob , who realizes over course series he degenerating into killer ? bruce willis kill umpteen terrorists " die hard " films not once question if he himself becoming murderous his enemies ; king mob instead gains enlightenment , realizes all life precious . course , if something like this happened mainstream action film , audiences would write it off tree-hugging schlock . but here it works , mostly because morrison aimed something higher invisibles . most time , he succeeded	1

teacher perspective , it hard find " perfect " italian book or audio cd recommend students , because i often run into these two situations : 1 ) book too in-depth too focused grammar ; 2 ) book too superficial more phrase-book travelers , therefore not sufficient . so , what i usually use combination books , including audio cds , this one them . it some useful information culture , well practical expressions brave traveler . however , my recommendation take basic course before traveling italy , because even knowing few simple sentences get you long way . also , group setting you'll able ask specific questions practice others . i'm sure if you check your local community college , there some short continuing education courses foreign languages . non dimenticare ! don't forget : trick learning language repetition , so any audio cd gets you repeat words over over again , great practice . more you repeat , more you'll remember ! it like learning song : you can't sing song you've heard only 1 time , but if you hear it over over , you'll able sing all lyrics !! so , keep up good work ! if you need information traveling italy books learn italian , you also contact me : nada@nadasitaly.co	1

if you bother parse author execrable writing , you find he very little say whatever it french people avoid obesity . instead , he goes off tangents . he tells cutesy anecdotes family members probably aren't even interesting his other family members . established french more inclined eat organic produce natural-sourced food than americans , he then fills pages irrelevant ( dumbed-down ) factoids chemicals food . if ( he says ) french aren't big surgical solutions obesity ( e.g. , stomach stapling liposuction ) , why he included entire rambling chapter them ? fact , you might wonder how how someone apparently incapable getting freaking point clower got phd . but if he just stuck point , he wouldn't book--he'd short , not-well-supported essay suitable peddling one less-renumerative ladies ' mags . unsurprisingly , he sticks hard-to-quantify , touchy-feely ( generally useless ) explanations how french stay thin avoids mentioning one contributing factor most epidemiologists agree : french smoke like chimneys	-1

economists turning their focus inquiry subjects once exclusive preserve their colleagues other social sciences -- history , sociology , political science . title this book , " economic origins dictatorship democracy , " appears deliberately , even provocatively , chosen contrast its famous predecessor , " social origins dictatorship democracy , " sociologist barrington moore . it if economists saying , " you've your go . it now our turn . " one thing follows when economists go : occam razor wielded ruthlessly . occam razor principle associated medieval franciscan monk , william ockham , which extols simplicity over complexity : his words , " plurality should not posited without necessity . " this , over time , become important principle distinguishing good less-good science , useful less-useful descriptions reality . acemoglu robinson take this cu t-t he-chaff exhortation heart . few simple sharp answers provided even complex difficult questions heart book : why how democracy arise ? why how democracy take root some places some times , while making only cameo appearances others ? acemoglu robinson daringly reduce determinants democratization three or perhaps four : level inequality society ; structure economy ( i.e. whether it predominantly agrarian or otherwise ); kind assets owned elites ; extent globalization . it remarkable how many historical experiences-in latin america , europe , africa -- explained simple theory put forward authors . example , argentina frequent lurching various forms democracy autocracy follow neatly high levels inequality , which made elites very resistant democratization consequent redistribution wealth away them political change would entail . sure , fit theory historical experience not perfect , authors candid this . some cases book not discuss-india ability maintain democracy face overwhelming odds , example -- traditionally defied easy explanation , even political scientists . there surely cases where non-economic factors such ideology , individuals ( leaders ) , randomness , unintended consequence , significant role determining path political development . example , if sir sewoosagur ramgoolam , mauritius ' first prime minister , responded referendum before independence entrenching majority hindus rather than assuaging minority guaranteeing minimal political participation latter , mauritius might well like archetypal , strife-ridden , ethnically divided african country rather than durable democracy . quibble book structure . while there considerable rewards reading book , patience deft maneuvering through thicket mathematics , required reap them . authors could demarcated more clearly greek english allow mathematically challenged obtain benefits one continuous flow . way , book could more accessible curious generalist addition required reference specialist . but these minor shortcomings ultimately swamped , perhaps even unavoidable consequence , sheer ambitiousness effort : nothing less than provide simple unified explanation democracy . here additional bonus , theory taken data , even falsified . so , skeptics naysayers their go , refute or validate . either way , inquiry furthered stock knowledge enriched . most memorable rendition occam razor due einstein : " everything should made simple possible , but not simpler . " book certainly meets standard .	1

you might define field scientific investigation amount material very smart person process working around 20 hours per week . " process " i mean reading literature doing new experiments , i say 20 hours per week because most scientists spend more than half their time administrative junk . course , days when scientists like . copernicus i . newton their prime , there much less administration much less knowledge , so one scientist could meaningfully contribute multiple fields still time hobbies ( like practicing medicine ) . nowadays scientist might spend his entire career working one small part one small problem , progress so incremental it only noticed his immediate peers . that sign real progress , because it means many big problems long ago solved . but it also means very few scientists luxury looking big picture . so what happens if big picture where all answers ? what if there few laws stretch across disciplines , our modern-day isaac newtons spend all their time working details ? it possible , if it true we would need approach spans fragmented fields science , that what e.o. wilson calls consilience . book very well-written , it provides interesting survey many different aspects science humanities . idea certainly makes sense abstract , although i'm not really sure what author calling practice . i agree it would great if scientists educated more broadly outside their immediate disciplines , but i'm not sure how this without sacrificing some rigor drives science forward . maybe i missed something . wilson often criticized his suggestion methods science used study humanities . some reason this really bothers people , i don't understand why . all he saying scientific method great way understand how things work , there no good reason think music or poetry exceptions . last week there article journal science describing mathematical structure musical chords . author found chord sequences people find attractive occupy clusters non-euclidean geometric space . math allowed him detect patterns music certain composers , even certain styles music . all accounts very exciting discovery , one deepens my appreciation both music mathematics . why anyone would feel threatened this mystery should studied state-of-the-art neuroimaging methods	1

" anyone raised america ( presuming author intended audience ) who doesn't already understand these things take them heart isn't going interested reading them book , if they even read . chapter 15 deals staring differences where author admonishes : " not repeat racist , sexist or ethnic jokes or tolerate them your presence . " if you not racist you would obviously already understand agree this . if you , this book isn't going change your attitude you would probably want burn it . i found this book useless any reasonably sophisticated person unless you happen third world country or planet . if book intended teach good manners unsophisticated , dream ! i think author professor henry higgins jones . i am also concerned my father opinion me , i mean " not expect child endure lengthy shopping trip unless it toy or candy store .

kapuscinski born poland 1930s lived through world war ii . he would go write poland national news service ( their version ap ) foreign correspondent . he covered " little wars , " insurgencies , revolutions , coups barely reported western media . his point view fascinating : man living behind iron curtain serves his country reporting terrifying conflicts most inhospitable parts world . when you read kapuscinski work you may first feel like something missing , then you realize what missing western perspective presumption detachment comes it . kapuscinski , like no other writer i've read , able delve into psyche his subjects produce remarkable insights their nature nature their oppression . which isn't say his writing dry . more often than not , episodes he relates quite harrowing . shah shahs no exception . quite unexpectedly , i found this book shah his overthrow ayatollah khomenei very relevant today conflicts , specifically , difficulties inherent replacing brutal oppressive regime without falling prey extremism . his discussion horrors shah secret police , savak , astonishing , his insight into vulnerability iranians they attempted move decades oppression fascinating . assessing difficulties undoing damage regime like shah , parallels today struggles iraq hard ignore , , such , book especially interesting read this moment history . i one book kapuscinski left read , after , i only hope some benevolent publisher decides put out more his work	1

this fascinating buying guide classical music recordings many positive attributes . it full interesting historical context composers their works fascinating performer trivia , making it quite entertaining educational addition comparing many recording choices . compared penguin or gramophone , it gives much more in-depth backgroung each work history significance . also , there lack any " british bias " ( since published usa ) some cite gramophone or penguin ( both uk published ) . case point : american pianist , garrick ohlsson superb eight volumes chopin arabesque label . third ear only guide extensively review each ohlsson arabesque cd while there not one mention 2003 penguin or gramophone . bias ? perhaps more likely brits just not familiar all musicians " across pond . " its really impossible any one guide " end-all " guide . notable unique feature third ear guide many pages great biographies famous musicians instrument back ( pianists , violinists , violists , cellists , wind players , percussionists , vocalists etc ) . so , here you find legends rubinstein , horowitz , pires , perahia , grumiaux , oistrakh , casels , starker , bain , holliger , graham , pavoratti many other admired musicians/vocalists thoughout past century . addition some curious history career milestones these well-loved performers , third ear guide also cites some their better recordings - real valuable feature i found . however , this guide waxes hot cold depending composer/genre . example , listings available performances huge category like beethoven 32 piano sonatas , there several entire pages covering nearly two dozen musicians who recorded those works compelling insights into their styles , historic performances careers . really great stuff conoisseur ! but , other categories it different story . most frustrating some many cases , obvious top recordings major performers not mentioned , leaving reader incomplete information . but , bottom line no one guide end-all resource , serious collectors this guide gramophone penguin guides each really something valuable often unique contribute study finest recordings . style side , commentary not dry academic but full human interest spicy opinions - revealing " nuggets " fascinating information music you most love . additionally , editors not always prim-and-proper , saying only positive things ( like penguin guide ) but actually give critical insightful comments which truly helps one sort out pack . this respect , third ear guide probably most interesting read compared others . so , this guide much more than just guide look up ratings - it fascinating journey into classical music , its vast repertoire its performers . if you serious collector , multiple guides area always best way go get wide variety opinion . if you really only pick one guide , most people would go legendary penguin guide . but , my second guide would definately third ear ( over gramophone ) it often lists recordings suprisingly not listed penguin . also , it just plain fun fascinating read random	1
admittedly , my education area american history somewhat lacking -- so my review going bit less critical than others , simply lack much compare it . however , i say schlesinger writing style witty , academic yet unprententious , almost lyrical flow it--it not dry reading though subject matter . if you don't know much american history beyond major events or what occurred over past 60 years , you learn things american politics you won't hear discussed any talk show , news program or editorial section newspaper . example , schlesinger points out " unilateralism " favored bush administration nothing new american history -- fact , more internationally involved stance maintained during cold war anomaly . this crucial point almost never brought up debates current events ; most people argue administration standpoint egregious break " american " foreign policy . author personal political viewpoint , i think schlesinger quite honest where he stands ( liberal ) , but i don't think this problem . he frank reader his own beliefs ; i think it better he this than pretend none all , which virtually impossible any historian ( though , obviously , there more or less blatant ways doing so ) . all historical accounts or analyses filtered through author individual lens . i don't think book suffers all because this . there few times focus book seemed bit all over place , but generally i feel i learned lot reading it . i would definitely recommend this anyone who doesn't read lot history normally but who curious nonetheless . schlesinger great writer easy get into -- additionally , text quite short history book , so this also makes it ideal beginner .	1

i recently thumbing through overview book philosophy , writers made passing mention how theism viable intellectual option , simply virtue defense theism mounted great christian thinkers . author three examples descartes , reid , plantinga . alvin plantinga philosophical work spanned half century influenced whole philosophical world , among theistic non-theistic thinkers alike . books like god other minds , nature necessity , god , freedom , evil not only stood test time , but their influence continues felt across variety disciplines . analytic theist ( hereafter tat ) , editor james sennett collected most forceful significant his writings . one benefits such anthology it shows development philopher thought over time . here roots movement now known reformed epistemology , plantinga argument belief god no more unjustified than belief other minds his monumental essay , " reason belief god , " where he begins laying groundwork his later work why theistic belief legitimate epistemic warrant . but there more plantinga than epistemology . sennett includes his " free defense " problem evil , his modal version ontological argument god existence , few chapters philosophical theology , even review book new testament criticism . all these selections plantinga trademarks evident : his sharp wit , his use humor , his lucid writing style , most importantly , weighty clear-headedness mark any good analytic philosopher . those unfamiliar analytic philosophy or type meticulous logical argumentation plantinga utilizes , there some chapters seem difficult , if not downright opaque . case any highly specialized academic field , this expected , but general reader - especially general christian reader - should not turned off plantinga rigor . there other selections tat much easier going casual reader but equally important some more technical chapters . only potential complaint i tat it contains no chapters plantinga work area epistemic warrant , either warrant : current debate or warrant proper function , both which published five years prior tat . no study plantinga complete if it ignores his notion warrant , but minor quibble . tat essential reading any christian who endeavors intellectual faith . there something here not only christians academia but every believer . most christian scholars writers - if they worth their weight paper - already familiar plantinga , but it shame many christian leaders teachers seem not discovered his inestimable value . pastors , knuckle down pick up anything alvin plantinga . begin either analytic theist or warranted christian belief . it time move into big leagues .	1

review under mine ridiculous . this person obviously knows nothing tennessee williams . incidentally , i no interest his email address which he egomaniacally implies one should look . characters this play not hysterical ( except shannon once when he goes off deep end , that not hysteria come think it ) . this beautiful , moving , perceptive exceptional play . i won't give away plot case anyone wants read it . williams wrote lots good some great plays . this great one . i came upon this review ( one under it which just inaccurate , reviewer apparently hard time grasping what he reads , if he read it ) because i just saw movie this play want reread it again . i've read it many times , i love it . i think ( though i'm not sure ) bette davis played maxine original production , unlike ava gardner ( who perfect part ) , her " ha ! " ( described stage directions ) explosion , occurred frequently . one scene i give away . shannon tells hannah place where animals go deficate . place so poor people so hungry , people go through dung looking eating bits undigested food . hannah goes behind tree throws up . left out movie . this very kind gentle play . emotionally ( all williams ' plays i've read , he used hero mine , i've outgrown him , except this gem ) intellectually ( not so customary ) deep .

james robert parish " fiasco " interesting read anyone penchant hollywood film history . but it review some worst pictures ever made , he seems repeating himself - pictures fail only when they don't bring requisite amount dollars . everything else secondary whether or not film makes money - not just ( relatively ) small profit . movies make many , many times their cost not failure . pretty high hurdle . ultimately , causes all same : lack studio or producer oversight ; inflated star egos ; unplanned ( costly ) over-time ; bad press reviews . some hollywood truly awful films not reviewed here ( " heaven gate " primary example ) some arguably fair movies ( just not big money makers ) . example , " cleopatra " opening chapter sets stage all follows . you'll get no argument me " cleopatra " trial make . however ( my humble opinion ) final result lush tale fails only last third picture . given , i laugh one contemporary reviewer comment " [ elizabeth taylor ] screeches like ward heeler wife block party " last half film . so true ! mr. parish also refers number vanity films made promote liberal political views actors involved ( " chase " , " wild party " " reds " example ) but never explores possibility audiences go movies entertained - not lectured . i know it currently popular criticize entertainers using their platforms promote their personal political views i'm not trying join band wagon . but it fair suggest movie made primarily criticize traditional american mores ' not going big hit vast majority traditional americans . each chapter begins brief overview state theater going , i.e. , attendance numbers , ticket price , etc . this interesting itself . it also contains some few surprises . example , who knew song dance numbers " ishtar " intentionally bad ?! i just thought natural product fact beatty hoffman , while talented actors , neither singers nor dancers . all-in-all , mr. parish book entertaining read fair accounting some worst films ever made , though he offers little hope studios , talent or corporate owners learned anything way lessons their checkered past . book certainly breath fresh air traditional tinsel town history trumpets silver-screen successes bypasses its flops	1

proust great novel not need read all one time . i read it one volume time usually took six months year off volumes . i always able pick up right where i left off nothing lost , like visiting old friends . i think it ok think remembrance things past series novels . i know proust would disagree this . it very important him his readers consider carefully unifying theme symmetry which he aspired novel , but i think aspect became less less tangible his manuscript grew 1000 pages originally 2000 , then 2000 4000 odd pages it ended up ( he continued expand manuscript right up until time his death ) . any event , grand theme he designed not lost you if you stay novel until end it wonderful when you consider it , but it not reason i love novel so well . swann way , within budding grove , guermantes way decisively best volumes , fortunately , they first three order . if you like swann way but intimidated gargantuan size entire series , then plan read least first three volumes . this way you experienced proust best material . entire novel essentially fictional autobiography or memoir . it narrated man whose name we never given , although he hypothetically suggest name " marcel " himself one occasion three-fourths way through . story inspired events people proust life , but it strictly fiction . swann way only volume which narrator not central figure story . it , ultimately , conventional story several fascinating characters humorous , razor sharp dialogue . there several recurring , ingeniously depicted themes novel , not least which involuntary memory , it often reads like deeply philosophical essay , proust wandering off one his famous digressions . philosophical digressions best part me , but i could see why they could distracting or tedious some . proust sentences quite frequently stretch 10 , 20 , or even 30 lines , multiple subordinating clauses . it dizzying . some claimed this makes him stream-of-consciousness writer . i flat out reject this notion . it never , ever pretentious or unnecessarily wordy . literary historians love bracket proust same category joyce ( like art historians like couple , example , van gough gauguin ) , but two writers different night day . every sentence worth time proust , there no word games , there no obscurity , it all essential rewarding . only complaint i he spends too much time theme jealousy later volumes , theme he covered quite well swann way . those volumes worth reading too , but they tendency drag out way first three volumes don't . things pick up bit final volume , time regained , where everything comes full circle	1
this good preparation sat literature subject test , shorter than other prep books while still contianing lot good practice . there only 3 practice tests , which fine , becuase you dont need eight ( who really going practice eight times ? ) . fact , you probably force yourself practice once , so three plenty . it easy enough work through week before test , fact , it possible read whole thing two sittings , if you familiar way sats work don't need read general intructions beginnging . " meat " preparation ( test strategies section ) only 62 pages long , easy enough read . although , there probably too few drills practice , you need take practice test get real sense what questions like . i noticed quite few typos thoughout book , which seems ironic book focused engligh literature . i took practice test #2 , scored 580 ( which isn't great ) , looking over answer explainations , it seemed me like lot questions two or more very legitimate , equally arguable answers . other words , topics questioned too subjective , open interpretation , more so than actual , official , sat subject test , which i just took found easier than practice test this book . but i not recieved my score back yet- so we see . also , book talks tests lot what it calls " roman numeral questions " , question format where you given three choices must choose combination roman numerals answer . it heavily stressed these confusing prevalent ... don't worry , i only encountered one these actual test . overall , i satisfied preparation this book provided , although i think it little too subjective questions it asked , which may frustrate you when taking practice tests . recommended someone who fairly good interpreting literature anyway ( " enlgish " person ) , who wants know what they going tested , especially people who not any specific preparation panicking wednesday before test ( me . ) not recommended someone who not " enlgish " person , or no familiarity literary terms/devices ( case , you probably shouldn't trying this subject test ) , or anyone who wants lot preparation becuase they feel really uneasy taking sat literature subject test .	1

i am actually reviewing both parts one two this since they should read together . reason why i enjoyed these plays so much because we see falstaff both them . he my favourite shakespearean character - big , bawdy , rough , liar cheat , but again we know what he right beginning , shakespeare keeps him so true character . these plays bit different some other histories . there more comedic parts them one thing . plays certainly used medium introducing young hal ( who become king henry ) . we see him young man , watch him grow see influences his society people it his development . he doesn't appear growing up well according his father because he so irresponsible . king henry iv not england strongest ruler . he haunted his guilt over death his predecessor , king richard ii . part two , comedy still plays big role , we still see falstaff influence young hal until shocking moment falstaff death . best part part two though deathbed scene old king henry iv his son prince henry . play leads us " king henry " . prince hal finally grow up he becomes very strong leader . actually king henry iv , parts one two should read before king henry . it correct sequence we see prince hal grow mature .	1

this wonderful recreation shakespeare time place . evocation england , it much superior ackroyd overly diffuse _albion : origins english imagination_ . ackroyd shakespeare actor poet first storyteller second , if all . ackroyd cautions us view theater elizabethans , highly-stylized rhetoric-festooned spectacle , not we now , attempt create naturalistic world miniature . ackroyd also great job portraying shakespeare he must seemed his contemporaries . he all rage while , undeniably talented , fast worker , but also frequent borrower other writers , even using verbatim passages sources his history plays . this he not unique his contemporaries , just moreso . magnitude his achievement would not become fully apparent three-quarters century . shakespeare here very much unseen seer , able take all guises never disclose his own true self . since all we really plays few legal documents , temptation infer shakespeare personality out his writings strong . ackroyd handles this pitfall-dotted terrain masterfully , reader never feels author climbing rainbows . neat surprise oft-parsed biographical material ackroyd assembles record lawsuit which shakespeare called witness . ackroyd points out this only surviving transcript shakespeare actual spoken words . perhaps typically , he noncomittal his testimony . latter fourth book only slightly less fascinating , plays finished biographical trail winds through miscellaneous legal materials contemporary allusions . but whole work great . ackroyd makes great tie-in end shakespeare life lines his last play : let us thankfulfor which , you leave disputethat above our question . let go offand bear us like time	1

poor , poor pere goriot ! this story tragic tale pathetic , old , doting father his martyrdom . goriot spoils his awful , frivilous , vain , ungrateful daughters throughout this book while they ignore manipulate him . daughters so terrible you can't help laughing little goriot pitiful way fawning over them putting them above even his most basic needs . they demand all best life while allowing their father live poverty need . they ask him luxuries when he barely enough survive . his concept paternal duty nothing less than inspirational , even though he pitiful , we can't help loving him admiring him despite his irritating messanic complex . balzac just such fun , rich , witty writer his characters so engrossing . he so adept pointing out self-absorption frivolity so many figures his time , making you feel bad their victims . i think any modern reader would enjoy him much they would-really more-than most contemporary writers . i think there should revival popularity books like these because they're just so much more intriguing than so many present day stories	1

problem pop-tune anthologies song lyrics heard , not read , only their music . especially so irving berlin , who nearly all his work theater films , whom presentation important song . ( picture " pretty girl like melody " without ziegfeld beauties -- impossible . ) fact berlin lines could flat-out flat-footedly corny . " melody mellow/played cello " only provoke giggles those unfamiliar songs , which i fear norm these days ; his worst he downright clueless . ( his proposed jingle unproduced nbc spectacular : " everybody step , /have drink coca-cola -- /it finest pepperola .... " pepsi-cola ? ) but this problem comprehensiveness . there too many " rag " songs " coon " songs " step-step-step " songs , too many singing musical notes dancing edibles , too much high-flown love treacle , too little poetry wit marked golden-age pop songwriting its finest . even most interesting ones like " sadie salome ( go home ) " , fresh their impudent suggestiveness , only hint their marvels . chronological layout inevitably sets up drab finish decades verbal noodling , reclusion despair . yes he wrote catchy tunes early days , but berlin didn't really come into his own until late , his thirties revues , fred-and-ginger scores , " holiday inn " , " this army " , " easter parade " , his one true masterpiece , " annie get your gun .

" mort " fourth book terry pratchett hugely popular discworld series . he gone win carnegie medal " amazing maurice his educated rodents " awarded obe 1998 . death - tall guy , somewhat underfed , big grin , carries scythe - appears more discworld books than any other character . however , " mort " first where his appearance anything other than very brief cameo - though , admittedly , he remains one book support characters . book hero mort , youngest son farming family living ramtops . he doesn't quite look typical hero : although tall overly-helpful , he also red-haired , freckled largely built knees . his family specialises distilling wine reannual grapes - you plant seed this year harvest grape last year . ( wine , you tend get hangover morning before need drink quite lot get over it ) . mort lack talent agricultural field ( boom boom ! ) , however , causing some concern his father . hoping someone hire him apprentice , lezek takes his son hiring fair sheepridge hogswatch night . although mort last one hired , he probably most aptly named apprentice - given his new boss death himself . despite mort initial discomfort position - he doesn't dead himself bones look entirely optional - he decides accept position . death also makes it clear he doesn't killing himself - that up assassins soldiers , example - he just takes over when people die . ( he , however , known murder curry ) . life ( if that what you call it ) death very strange . his home designed , unsurprisingly , varying shades dark much bigger inside than outside . he also daughter called ysabell butler called albert - both human not just skeletons - horse called binky . all also very much alive . problems start when mort starts shadowing his new boss work - specifically , when they due escort king olerv sto-lat into afterlife . king just assassinated his ambitious cousin duke sto-helit . unfortunately , princess keli next duke hitlist mort youthful hormones aren't too happy this . soon mort starts interfering , other questions start coming mind - like where death get daughter why he need apprentice ? despite his profession , death one funniest characters discworld . although it first book give him starring role , it may prove slight advantage read one or two other books . ( rincewind particular hobby death so " colour magic " " light fantastic may worth looking into ) . very highly recommended	1

admirer noel kingsbury prolific work , i initially put off this book . some passages , it reads like manifesto new approach gardening . futher reading , however , i found it stimulating , valuable , full hard-to-find information cutting edge work ornamental gardening , particularly europe . its emphasis design plantings reduced maintenance parks public areas not all off point home gardener - certainly this home gardener . i am 61 , only weekends gardening , weekends often interrupted other life demands , i garden difficult site heavy wet clay lots deer . so any gardening approach holds out way beautiful , sustainable garden , using plants suited existing conditions , i create maintain minimal effort time certainly value . moreover , kingsbury introduces me some exciting names gardening exciting gardens i've not known : work cassian schmidt hermanshoff germany only one example . this book window into world planting design gardening most us no access ( much published literature german ) kingsbury brings it light . i heartily recommend this book . it serious book , gives more more successive readings . if your time limited , you reread sections interest you find more value each time . i'm not sure what part piet oudolf actually played this book , but he certainly preeminent practitioner this style , his apparently loose association kingsbury should continue . they doing exciting work , this book puts their work into larger context gives it theoretical framework	1

let me start saying i thoroughly enjoyed this work . if you haven't read michener before , this great place start . typical michener , he tells story region over course centuries this book . michener selected particular river feeds chesapeake , choptank , his primary locale , but populated it geotypical persons , plantations , towns , rather than any specific actual persons or towns eastern shore chesapeake . grown up maryland , i experienced great deal nostalgia areas he describes . characters he creates believable complex . stories he tells across centuries compelling . i three concerns . first minor -- green-covered paperback word " scow " ( flat-bottomed boat ) replaced word " snow " every instance save one . this makes some odd reading , especially early chapters . second seems petty -- i actually believe there not quite enough information nearly 1000-page novel . he mentions guano trade , which significantly affected eastern shore , only one sentence end book . he doesn't explain some early economies very clearly . ( what salt purchased tortuga ? there no cash available , credit fithian seems unlikely extended there . ) islands other than fictional devon island ( e.g. tighlman island ) suddenly become important end book , referenced " old rivals patamoke . " if they old rivals , why didn't they appear before ? this get cut out book ? my third concern very strange charge levy against michener . anyone who seen musical " south pacific " knows , michener strongly opposed racism . certainly this book there whites , blacks , indians full range character talent . however , book still seems strange racist undertone i can't shake my mind . it comes how michener ties his story together across centuries . every janney feckless ( except one who becomes steed ) . every steed enterprising , although not necessarily industrious . every turlock craven . every cater proud , even if this expressed differently across generations . every paxmore upstanding , even sad-sack pusey paxmore believes he acting upstanding manor until he looks back what he . one steed even refuses acknowledge her own grandchildren because they turlock blood them , praised author doing so . i realize michener using shorthand help reader keep characters straight across centuries , but result rather too " geneticist , " arguing genes determine destiny	1

try imagine you write sketch comedy lines " saturday night live . " you trying come up skit parodying snooty intellectuals . no matter how talented you , you would unable create fictional satire effective real live harold bloom . bloom certainly pretty proud himself here . he gives us his insight into what makes these geniuses so brilliant . it gets laughable times . example , bloom argues dostoyevsky genius typified his tedious portrayal fyodor pavlovitchkaramazov , while he lacks any notable religious or philosophical genius because he anti-semite . yes bloom , anti-semitic really bad , but believe it or not , person some extremely warped ( or even evil ) views still make outstanding contributions our religious philosophical make up . abraham lincoln said some nasty racist stuff during his lifetime , but still laid out idea american civil religion beautifully gettysburg adress . i certainly find way socrates comported himself young boys more than bit disturbing works such plato " charmides , " but hardly detracts his apology . likewise , dostoyevsky fact religious philosophical genius , despite anti-semite . you'd think ivy league professor would demonstrate some understanding fact people need not morally one dimensional . then there bloom treatment " yawhist .

master terror , science fiction mystery genre , richard matheson work inspired many classic ( not so classic films ) . why ? because he one best writers working genre never quite good respect it deserved . his best work inspired people like dean koontz , stephen king , dan simmons other current masters terror . matheson shrinking man ( original title way -- incredible part novel what i recall added after movie made)begins simply enough ; scott carey out boat his brother when ship enveloped fine mist gently stings his skin . he wipes it off , goes down below tell his brother marty it thinks nothing it again . until he begins grow smaller each day . this simple beginning we immediately jump carey fighting spider basement his house ( although both novel film begin same way , after introduction matheson novel veers slightly different direction telling us most story flashback . smart choice novel it would bold choice film but universal-international veoted idea ) . marvelous novel deals themes sense self , loss control , ultimately , loss identity carey shrinks smaller smaller , it also marvelous story terror ( elements science fiction thrown well ) . finally back print after long slumber , incredible shrinking man fleshed out number stories ( novel only 200 pages)including " duel " ( basis steven spielberg film same name ) , " nightmare 20,000 feet " (the basis classic " twilight zone " episode featuring william shatner remade director george miller " twilight zone movie " ) , seven other short stories . warning readers order .

this book revealing typical young earth creationism ( yec ) . these people good great zeal defend christian faith . i commend them . but i must say loving way their method unscientific . it misleading untruthful . we cannot defend truth using par t-t ruth . either way , this still lying ! how anyone defend good cause bad tools ? this destroy christian witness gospel . theologian scientist i must refute young earth creationist movement . many christian leaders theologians opposing young earth creationism because their lies . scientist community ( including christian scientists ) rejects kind pseudoscience promoted distributed yec . today , evidence against young earth creationism ( yec ) continues accumulate . this leads inevitably general conclusion against all christianity . i am so grieved when i see atheists laughing kind science propagated yec . christ name hurt . why young earth creationists twist facts lie so much ? well answer simple . they not any evidence science whatsoever ! then , they invent it somehow . this how they it . they say god created universe ( this right ) . using usher genealogy they believe bible says earth young . ( bible not say ) then they say : " we prove what we believe means science ( after all god created science ) " . but science not helping them . then they forced dig around find any flaws science they use abuse . they continue accumulating anything they find make case ( bits pieces unresolved issues , like little discrepancies scientific data so ) . using scientific language ( their degrees science ) they go out their fields expertise continue their propaganda misinterpreting manipulating scientific data , twisting ignoring facts , misquoting various writers , using wrong tools different kinds measurements , etc . this lying . if they find one discrepancy out , lets say one hundred , they choose ignore 99 order stress one fits their theory . this not integrity . you call this science ? doing sound apologetics we need bring unbelieving scientists faith christ . unfortunately this kind yec propaganda doing exactly opposite . one day they held responsible before god . zeal not enough ; you need wisdom too . yec not any ! this sad .	-1

republicans allowed read science fiction ?? apparently so ! perhaps they sometimes stray pat robertson book month selection ! i'm commenting , course , reviews given some our " enlightened " readers . one which decided divulge outcome . talk " intelligent design " !!! oh , surprise , many them come texas !! let talk book . it good , period . solid science , la baxter . man his homework . pace perfect . it allowed reader really get stuck " gumbo " . characters exaggerated version simian lifeforms we now white house . sure , one admit it far truth .. but how far ?? who reject fact we ( usa ) much more alienated rest planet then we ever past ? book effective its message : if we , planet , not begin devote our resources colonization space , ( not heaven !! ) our existence was/is meaningless .	1

seeing some these reviews confirms my notion how general public praise crap like " da vinci code " or brain dead housewives weep over terrible " lovely bones " or think pretentious , cliched narratives like " time traveler wife " worth exploring . this 1st cj book i ever read , there i read every one since . his best book oxherding tale , but this comes close second . 1st all , i must respond rather biased nagative reviews claiming " how would ex-slave speak so intellegently kant , etc ... " well , point here " i " used book isn't necessarily rutheford point time , but perhaps years later , or even after his death . " lovely bones " awful book attempts narrator who dull s**t speak after she murdered . one reviewer commenting how certain railroads didn't exist until after civil war probably closest hint yr gonna get show this story told after his death , or much , much later . it while since i read this book , but descriptions poetic rich , it just sad how yet again cliche confirmed : take great book like middle passage , reviews middling good . but take yr average sappy , bathetic oprah pick , housewives rolling floor . if you like real literature , this you . but if what you want crap , then you won't get it	1

carl menger founded austrian school economics 1871 . austrian approach economics characterized three words : subjectivism , methodological individualism disequilibrium . essentially this comes down regarding economic phenomena outcomes rational individual choice - because multitude actors involved interdependency their choices - their pattern one disequilibrium continual adjustment . menger ' principles economics ' primer value theory . value theory foundation economics , because it describes nature economic decisions . classical economists ( smith marx ) claimed labour content key explaining relative prices . basis their argument equivalence value necessary condition exchange therefore - order make comparisons possible - value objects reduced common denominator . according adam smith value object someone effort required obtain it because hour toil just irksome one man it anyone else , ricardo -building adam smith incomplete value theory - claimed labour origin all value labour content its measure . labour seemed unit which all value reduced . next logical step this line thinking appearance invidious marxist fallacy , since labour necessary maintain labour , price labour equivalent labour necessary its reproduction - house , feed clothe it . if 10 hours labour offered daily employer , these 10 hours spent his worker his product should fetch capitalist equivalent 10 hours work spent product market . when only 5 hours his labour time necessary maintain worker , then capitalist " exploits " worker not compensating him full value his work . menger showed valuation goods subjective process . no matter how much labour spent good it wouldn't exchanged any other product unless it able satisfy some need which higher than need satisfied product given exchange . because value subjective exchange goods take place even when their labour content differs . commerce enhances welfare offering goods which relatively little value one party exchange goods which relatively higher value vice versa . commerce therefore not sterile process , but highly productive one .	1
but worthwhile . many here seem object sparseness author style . it require slightly more careful reading my par t--t here few sentences could skimmed over without risking getting lost . but i can't say bothered me terribly--i've always counted it point author favor when he refuses spoonfeed his audience . characters not typically likeable , i suppose , but they rich full . weird modernism alienating , fascinating -- settings bizarre intriguingly so . fine science fiction . tight , vivid imagery . disconcertingly imaginative . wild ride through cybernetic , astral futures , coupled new yet familiar seediness . well .	1

we love diana gabaldon outlander series . we 1st four cd now . it good actually begin see transition scotland america upheaval happened time prior american revolution . so often we get english centric view time . so often we look only french indian war - which actually called 7 years war europe - go no further . diana begins tie events scotland , england , france , colonies , how they flowed events scotland . since i always loved time travel science fiction , i enjoy interplay present past , historical research showing what goes past . i thought her loops information interesting too . since i some geneological research , i am well aware tediousness times , but joy discovery well . i thought she great job adding this story . i love way she brings customs time forefront , like witch trials , french court manners , travel documents , " hand fasting " , gathering clans name few . one thing her books i don't like one sexually explicit scene each books so far i could without . black jack randall interegation " outlander " , visit french king " dragon fly amber " , plantation scene " voyager " , rape scene " drums autumn " . these scenes actually not just gratuitous , they actually critical story . but it certainly made it hard listen kids car . dan mcmillen	1

i recommend this book . this first bell hooks i read , deeply impressed her clear , rooted moral position state american global society . her writing this piece shifts narrative her own history growing up south , present academic , political critique today . i found her writing fluid her point view significant . black woman america someone who experienced lower upper class existence according journey them , her perspective complex , making her voice deep necessary . no way i specify difference this book . she calls morally just society , which denounces consumerism perpetuates exploitation , racism , sexism while it advertised fantasized life pursuit . seeing current issue newsweek cover story , titled " how win , " regarding ceo expertise making money succeeding " american way , " immediately brought where we stand into consideration . this book call action , illumination depressing unjust , cruel foolish system which ignores afraid reforming itself enough allow " world where we all enough live fully well . " i particularly appreciated her chapters living simply , think it appropriate bold call make place where stuff acquisition social symbols significance . conclude , i found this description class page 103 , rita mae brown , important : " class much more than marx definition relationship means production . class involves behavior , your basic assumptions , how you taught behave , what you expect yourself others , your concept future , how you understand problems solve them , how you think , feel , act .	1

* case you can't tell length , i really , really loved this novel , if this review helps one person make decision buy read this gem , i'll feel if my day well-spent . * more i read , more my sense inner horror threatened erupt . each turned page , heavy sense despair foreboding settled over my mind . " book bad ? " you ask me . i reply resounding " no ! " " why , then , you horrified ? why , then , you despairing ? " you question . " because , " i answer , " each flip page , i one page closer end . " stereotypes misunderstood . they're so often used because they're so often true . i'm use valid one now , fact : there two types gay novels , surprisingly enough , they follow ancient greek theories theater . there gay drama , which must include least two gay-bashings ( one which often results death ) , least one failed suicide attempt , forty-seven deaths aids , romance end all romances nipped bud prejudice , suicide , aids , or all above . gay drama almost always synonymous ' gay tragedy , ' almost always political , often moral -- awaken people terrors gay prejudice change course society . almost like love ( which i now refer albil ) not gay drama variety ( thank god ) . no , albil gay comedy . these , like austen pride prejudice , " light bright sparkling , " usually quite literally , since they often flashy covers . gay comedies , while they may touch some serious issues , never confront them directly approach them only through lens tinted laughter . while they would not mind changing world better , that not their goal . no , gay comedy goal entertain , entertain , entertain !, none it quite well albil . my point , constant reader , this : expect albil what it intends give , you not one reviewers who viciously lampoons novel silly or unimportant or irrelevant . you would not go paris expecting everyone speak russian , so not read gay comedy expecting find earth-shattering drama . now , return issue hand : albil . i think best way begin confront few claims novel detractors . they claim , constant reader , albil storyline " so frustratingly predictable , [ sic ] it like playing connec t-t he-dots straight line " ( adam . barley , amazon.com, august 28 , 2005 ) . albil , i've already said , gay romantic comedy ; there no such thing non-predictable gay romantic comedy . yes , you know first few pages novel end travis craig rekindling their high school passion . yes , you know there some sort obstacle(s ) way . but you not read romantic comedies -- least , you shouldn't read romantic comedies -- surprised . pleasure derived reading novel like albil , however , not how often author throw you curveball but how well author keep your eyes ball . , quite frankly , once you begin reading , your eyes never leave book pages . few reviews mentioned novel too forceful its issues , it takes them beats you over head them . this , i ask , " what issues ? " yes , both craig travis become sort unintentional activist , but issues never take center stage . , after all , partly why albil gay comedy not gay drama . yes , there bit gay-bashing novel ( older high schooler calls younger one bad f-word ) , but aforementioned older high schooler gets his come-uppance , novel moves . yes , aids makes brief appearance , but it only brief one , not mention one necessity any story gay men living 80s . kluger never lets his characters or his novel become soap-box which campaign or altar which preach . fact , i quite surprised so many people claim he , since kluger merely uses issues , it seems , add depth likability his characters , not address issues their own sake . despite these two attacks novel , almost all previous reviews positive , rightly so . i said blurb , novel rather unconventional format , told mostly through excerpts unexpected items like restaurant menus newspaper clippings , so i feared i would not able connect characters much i would if novel chose more conventional narrative vehicle . interestingly -- i won't admit this too often -- i completely , entirely wrong . fact , quite opposite happened : i found myself appreciating characters more falling love them faster because unconventional way which they unwrapped . large part novel first-person narrative , course , so we not lose entirely age-old art paragraphs , but sporadically interspersed e-mails student assignments other crazy excerpts create certain amount depth novel itself , providing different angle which view characters . interestingly , none characters except travis craig explicitly narrative sections , yet supporting cast developed well two stars , all through kluger insertions personal webpages email correspondence phone conversations . quite fea t.t he novel not , course , flawless ; nothing , after all . novel end approaches faster than speeding bullet ; this may intentional , since beginning novel , when travis craig high school , also happens relatively quickly , it may aesthetically excellent choice , but someone who not want see novel end , realizing you only few pages feel like there ought few hundred more never good feeling . every character novel -- even travis roommate father craig mother , who play relatively marginal parts novel -- developed so well you feel if each one could his own spin-off novel if he tried . yet -- this inevitable -- certain characters developed more fully than others . travis , high school nerd who goes cross-country find craig , takes flesh bones much faster than craig retains bit edge over him throughout most novel . i not want belittle craig , because he expertly crafted well , but travis seemed more fully-realized individual than his lover . one other problem these two characters their narrative often sounded same ; since they such entirely different characters , i expected different writing styles , slightly different senses humor , etc ., but i not find their individual narratives ; they both sounded like travis . these gripes mine -- fast ending , slightly less-developed ( but not under-developed ) characters , etc . -- extremely insignificant , considering my praise . i said before , i finished novel , i really horrified . i really close novel feel more depressed than i when i started , simply because story over . i leave travis craig , brian clayton , kevin charleen jody , aj gordo , noah . way i judge truly great work literature -- whether it shakespearian high art or nora roberts-esque popular fiction -- way i feel when i turn last page . when piece question truly great , there feeling settles over you , feeling like you've just -- use clich , which misunderstood stereotypes -- lost your best friend . because you just lose your best friend , after all . entire entourage them , really . feeling , sense " what now ?, " truly great ... part reason i really hate reading truly great literature . nobody likes losing his best friend , after all , especially if there isn't sequel	1

i definitely liked this sarcastic but warm book solitary travels thru europe , interlaced fragments journey taken years earlier certain weirdo named katz . glimpses into european culture just great- how movie tickets sold here , how food served attitude there . also , there great comedy scenes odd duck places like lichtenstein milan , but also rewarding beauty capri paris . i wish two things : there more katz , who one most misanthropic figures i come across while generally makes good comedy ; also , last three chapters hadn't felt quite so tired . i suspect just realistic impression how author feel towards end his journey but it anti-climactic .	1

after reading some reviews available , i felt it necessary provide more balanced perspective this novel . few years ago , i read secret life bees . admittedly , mermaid chair not quite measure up , however , it its own merits . while readers may not necessarily agree portrayal religious figures , i not believe kidd any way attempting show them negative light . if one this interpretation , it shallow one , best . initially , i myself disappointed main character preoccupations men , but it takes looking beyond these aspects come away perhaps different interpretation . i feel this work helps us begin discover what makes us all human , many issues , despite what american public tends think , complex don't necessarily clear-cut answers . each us human unique experiences . perhaps then so-called hard-and-fast solutions not fitting many situations . who among us should judge what right wrong without gaining some perspective their personal situation first ? furthermore , everyone not immune making mistakes . perfection not realm what human , perhaps imperfection serves important function forming who we . given this , even seemingly insane behavior , like jessie mother cutting off her fingers , begins make more sense . i urge readers look meaning goes further than crazy people cutting off fingers married woman affair monk order come away better understanding what it binds all us together	1

this amazing novel i bought my son read . when i i almost always read book first make sure it appropriate . it definitely ! talk empowering child things . not only book show great , fleshed-out character , but also nice supporting cast not used crutch place weak main character . few supporting characters could used more , but then there more novels , so you can't give everything away first book ! , whose origin shrouded mystery , apprenticed quiet ranger , who few secrets must explored well . become ranger like halt ? he learned enough allowed continue training before next ranger gathering ? he learn his past ? if you want find out , then read this excellent book . there room author grow , couple events slightly predicable , but story isn't hampered . it really makes more endearing . this novel real page turner , i cannot wait my boy finish his current book so he begin this one . if you liked dragonlance chronicles or harry potter series , you might like this one well . great adventure story	1

this immensely interesting provocative little book ray kurzweil . because its ultimately predictive nature , this book raise many eyebrows ( there even discussion neo-luddites ! ) more erudite people probably ask more questions than this book answers . nevertheless , this book hold you spellbound least until predictions begin . readership interested technology , it provides many , many interesting facts stimulating theories around it . one these surely " law accelerating returns " way technological advancement throughout history understood light this law its corollaries . big learning computational models - recursive , genetic finally evolutionary . it fascinating learn how these models work , how these models implemented many niche domains including investments primary markets . third big plus book snippets discussions technologies which still emerging far main stream including invasive non invasive scanning human brain , state virtual reality , etc . kurzweil also good job raising some very fundamental questions . primary among these artificial consciousness . however , these likely debates raging years sometimes these questions , though raised , not conclusively answered insipidly dealt . each chapter ends conversation molly - machine ( though conscious one ! ) kurzweil . perhaps idea summarize chapter novel way throw bit humour . both respects , kurzweil success moderate . far predictions concerned , time tell . world today , state technology not pervasive kurzweil book seems imply . more children die disease hunger each day africa than developed world seems care . it almost decade since dolly , sheep , cloned . however , cloning technology remains behind closed doors . socio-politico-economic consequences development remain issue needs time , understanding categorization . nevertheless , this remains important book - get technology-focused point view then take learnings evaluate them context broader world we live . no computer yet . !	1

this first graham greene novel i read , encouraged because it my cousin ( her husband ) favorite book . little i know i would relate protagonist so much . i , firstly , would like say i loved this book . true human suffering not always gory . emotional suffering sometimes " cut deeper " . greene writing style legitimate emotion conflict me analyzing all my romantic relationships . although i am not " religious fan " i feel her turn toward god religion plausible one . one many people would use end affair . book captures idea you can't choose who you love but there always consequences adultery . religious revelation leaves nasty taste my mouth , but again , i've seen it happen real people , so fact fictional characters going through something real , makes book story love believable . after reading this graham i ended up reading most his works few short months . graham books definately classics their own right capture human heart , human emotion , human deception unique way i relate .	1

i've just completed book generally concur other positive reviews . it good read book generalist who across several subjects disciplines incorporates into his/her work - which what winchester so successfully here . my quibble very early book winchester makes very big statement which not actually backed up . page 5 he states much larger volcanic eruptions ( toba , tambora , taupo , katmai)had much less direct effect human society than krakatoa . he bases this observations 1883 humans much more sophisticated - there trained observers , technological innovations ( telegraph particular ) which linked world . ok , one accept 1883 eruption huge , devastating etc but virtually say it overwhelms others truly huge statement . 73000 years ago there vast explosion toba sumatra makes 1883 explosion look mild . toba seems ended inter glacial period ushered long volcanic winter which created " bottleneck " event where very few survivors ( few 1000-3000 worldwide ! ) genetic material became predominant . this time when homo erectus our sapiens ancestors spreading around globe . but we don't go back far . 1815 there bigger explosion tambora which killed more people , created year without winter ( 1816 ) . this recorded history but no there no telegraphs . eruptions mediterranean around 500bc earlier krakatoa eruptions ( especially ad515 event ) bigger again . winchester deal earlier krakatoa event but rather cursory dismissive way . yet there indications 515ad event killed off civilsation java . there no suggestion 1883 eruption destroyed any civilisation all . this modern historical bias - attitude what reported recently more important than what not reported earlier . this criticism no way detracts excellent stuff winchester included his book . he paints comprehensive picture what cataclysm , but say it most important global catastrophe not correct .	1

i think frantzen downright scary ! not only he write our inner worlds so accurately , most people hate him his books ... but he also seems know our outer world eerily perceptive way . just read pages describing " decadent people " response catastrophe , there you our 9/11 reality . those pages gave me goosebumps . then , few pages , we watch all monsters who created financial environmental disaster , skip away their millions . hmmmm ... he not only damn talented words , deep , deep understanding what people really , what love , what sacrifice , but also what our corrupt society . frankly , i keep amazed , i can't wait read everything he written . it possible readers become so upset him because he bringing literature new realm ? realm we may not ready ? realm we're not comforable because it so much less " arty " -- despite his beauty words , but so much more real . no his characters not likeable -- we , when we're all naked confused scared selfish ? i don't think so . but they -- only one or two exceptions his books -- loveable . we come know his characters way god must . inside , where , all ugliness flaws , there grace beauty . ultimately , all satire , irony , cynicism , these books rich hope , redemption , grace . damn this writer who knows something	1

normally book this long readers like myself cannot even get close end before saying , " enough already , get point . " this book , however , different . fourth installment j.k. rowling harry potter series , harry potter goblet fire full danger deceit lurking around every adventurous corner . while this book longest books so far it jam-packed excitement character development . end this book i not thinking seven hundred thirty-five pages i just finished reading , nor eight hundred seventy pages next book , i just wanted get back hogwarts harry potter fifth year . while school during his fourth year , harry sees hears things he never thought he would this makes thrilling addition series . harry summer ends his attendance exciting quidditch world cup weasley family . no sooner game end than death eaters begin attacking muggles muggle-born wizards dark mark lord voldemort conjured unknown person woods use harry missing wand . soon he returns school , danger continues get closer harry . tri-wizard tournament held hogwarts although age restriction placed goblet emit champion names , someone who it out harry managed get his name entered it unfortunately chosen goblet . later book , while harry waits alone dumbledore office speak him he sees hears more unexpected . he discovers pensieve which he accidentally finds himself one dumbledore memories death eater trials . first , harry not known what going or where he but after few scenes dumbledore returned his office pulled harry back into present time explaining phenomena he just experienced . whilst memory he heard startling news neville longbottom parents . dumbledore further explains neville parents currently living asylum because they cruciatus curse placed them some time ago afterward never quite same . most shocking information what stood out most me information harry learns later book when faced once again lord voldemort . tri-wizard cup inner most part maze used third task tournament . first wizard reach this cup champion . harry cedric , who decided both grab handles same time , quickly realized it actually portkey which transported both champions cemetery voldemort muggle father now called home . while there , lord voldemort summons death eaters touch dark mark peter pettigrew arm harry soon discovers identities some dark lord most loyal followers . because identities death eaters always so mysterious up until this point we only put together our sneaking suspicions , this information quickly becomes very satisfying . most satisfying aspect book however character development . readers notice this book introduces many new intriguing characters such rita skeeter , annoying reporter daily prophet who just cannot seem leave well enough alone -- or matter tell truth her reports , professor mad-eye moody , paranoid seemingly insane ex-auror who introduced hogwarts ' new defense against dark arts teacher who keeps strangely protective watch over harry . more importantly readers notice marked difference approach rowling makes toward her characters this installment series . weasley get lot more attention this book than series thus far . fred george get more text this book whereas others they just backdrop characters readers finally get meet charlie bill eldest weasley bunch . because harry busy through most book worrying tri-wizard tournament , we also get see more ron than before . this book we watch him struggle two different issues effort rowling show his growth through puberty . ron first inner struggle harry constant overshadowing him . youngest weasley boys , ron felt like runt bunch all his life then it just so happens his best friend hogwarts , top second most famous name wizarding world next you-know-who , now strangely fourth champion this year tri-wizard tournament . ron second inner struggle tension hermione himself . when hermione gets asked yule ball none other than ron hero , international quidditch star tri-wizard champion representing durmstrang , viktor krum , ron feels crushed flooded feelings jealousy . hermione expressed ron next time he needed date he would better off asking her first before someone else gotten chance . this character tension quite reason look forward upcoming books series . addition , hermione busy library much book researching her activist group , society promotion elfish welfare . hermione seen first time this book outside interests ; although she quickly enlists harry ron membership , this something hermione developed her own reflective direction her character growth . whereas other harry potter books series up until this point ended rather positive note , this one surprisingly not . rowling managed break patterns readers may thought they would find this book . end , because harry narrowly escapes lord voldemort instead sending him back into hiding , it makes reader want run right out fifth book even quicker . my opinion , this book could make or break reader interest series ; but sheer horror finality cedric diggory death awful foreboding comes rebirth lord voldemort , rowling fifth harry potter book series promises even more surprising than fourth .	1

i heard importance , significance " education henry adams " long time . i finally determined i needed read it . i acutally read it twice , found less it second time than first . i am sorry i missed greatness this book . i am sure there something wrong me , but i found it incredibly unimpressive . perhaps this came fact henry adams not likeable man . he famous holding court his home near white house , making caustic negative comments every president who lived there . granted , he lived washington time when there plenty second-rate occupants white house . but thought people wasting their time trying please blue-blooded snob like adams depresses me . why anyone bother ? he lived atmosphere snobbery , sharp-tongues , clever remarks , brilliant conversation . world went without him , truth told , he contributed less than people who walked his house each day . he very good historian his time . but who reads his books now ? not very many . short , his own work not long-lasting he would wanted it . maybe influence some presidents he mocked lasted longer than published purchased work henry adams . " education henry adams " not much real information . he got education one place , none others . surely , suicide his wife provided some very painful education henry -- but he wrote nothing it his book . when eric sevareid wrote " not so wild dream , " it compared " education henry adams . " meant compliment . oddly , i think sevareid book much , much better . sevareid wrote america , common man , war , what it all meant him . adams needed get out more . he not see america -- not america built common citizen who put it all together , defended it . i gained trememdous amount sevareid . i cannot say same work henry adams . again , lot this might me . perhaps i read book bad time . maybe i needed read it third time . i not know . i know i not think this great american classic . forgive , please , my ignorance .	-1

citizen explores just what freedom really it follows young man , thorby , he matures boy man . starting slave sold most unusual beggar , baslim , we see first aspect many equate absolute opposite freedom , though we see fact ' slaves ' sometimes more freedom choice than ' free men ' . society he paints here vivid believable ( though economics slavery star-travelling culture always seemed little dubious me ) . baslim far more than he appears , puts thorby through rigorous education , both academic practical . how you become really good beggar ? here heinlein falls ayn rand - whatever you , it best your ability , begging juggling . also there several comments included here integrity self - lies others misleading yourself both come some dictums . these items may pass over young readers ' heads , but perhaps planting seeds all assumptions should examined , nothing should accepted ' faith ' , personal integrity more important than ' success ' , consequences actions should examined carefully before committing action . later , baslim calls some favors sends thorby live free traders , group space merchants keep themselves their own unique culture . here thorby discovers aspect freedom : person ability he wishes severely constrained culture which he lives . free trader society ( which owes much margaret mead seminal ideas , highlighted anthropologist character named margaret mader - heinlein not usually so obvious his names ) rigid matriarchal domination separation into moieties provides security , peace mind , ability through rigid rules formalism allow small group people live together extended periods without breaking any heads , but its downside great limitations freedom choice . this section book may best part , society so different today american culture it becomes fascinating its own right , apart its effects thorby . thorby himself grows changes significantly this part book , first love determining just how he must balance demands duty personal desires . last section deals thorby back earth , within society not much different our own , shows third aspect freedom : internal courageousness make your own decisions act upon them . freedom just constrained internal timidity and/or defining decisions external forces . this last section offers little terms new or different views society ( though it good mirror some flaws capitalistic/lawyer dominated one ) , it isn't engrossing first two sections , but highly important terms completing heinlein thematic investigation all aspects freedom . characterization other than thorby baslim pretty thin , especially females appear supporting roles . this fairly typical his juveniles , they basically strong adventure novels their primary focus their central character . but thematic line slavery/freedom much stronger here than most his messages other books , this particular position also stated some those other works ( most especially farnham freehold ) , seen one heinlein personal beliefs ( unlike some other positions he proposes his books seem mainly designed stir up debate ) . this book not heinlein absolute best , nor even best his so-called ' juveniles ' ( which typically better reading than most ' adult ' mainstream bestsellers ) , but still provides engrossing , fun , illuminating read . recommended all readers willing look life styles different their own . --- reviewed patrick shepherd ( hyperpat )	1
ron heifetz clearly one seminal leadership scholars , practitioners , teachers field today . this superb volume , sharon daloz parks , takes off where his two previous books ( " leadership without easy answers " " leadership line " ) leave off . " leadership taught " takes its readers through heifetz harvard business school course " pal 101 -- exercising leadership : mobilizing group resources . " those us who studied heifetz two previous books taken courses modeled off his hbs course ( i columbia teachers college almost decade ago ) , " lcbt " provides excellent refresher . my columbia tc professor ( who must ta'd heifetz when she teaching harvard graduate school education ) ran outstanding version his course her own right . using all heifetz key principles pedagogical techniques ( very similar curriculum ) , she put us through our paces teaching leadership " adaptively . " it watershed learning experience invaluable practical value me . although my field leadership development secondary-school education ( both teachers students ) , i borrow heavily heifetz theory work graduate level . although i doubt they intended this way , i see these 3 works sort trilogy adaptive leadership . heiftez " leadership line " ( co-written marty linsky ) probably most accessible three : clearly place any reader start learning h powerful approach . " leadership without easy answers " most scholarly thoroughly developed ( extensive historical examples , etc . ) . daloz parks " lcbt " concentrates heifetz leadership course itself . what experience taking it like his students ? how o--o don't--its lessons stick them they resume their professional lives ? daloz parks answers these questions balanced , fair , accurate , leavened plenty anecdotal evidence . we get glimpses classroom interactions , we hear professor heifetz speaking quite candidly advantages -- well challenges -- his dynamic educational approach . any serious scholar or teacher leadership must peruse this product harvard business school press . one beauties heifetz approach it works virtually any area : business , education , public service , etc . its principles apply equally commercial not-for-profit sectors . sum , i can't recommend " leadership taught " highly enough leaders and/or faculty leadership-development programs all stripes . sharon daloz parks us all great service recording impact heifetz work those fortunate enough study master himself	1

i never actually thrown book across room frustration - i love books , so this drastic ! spoilers ahead - please don't read if you haven't read book . i managed ( somehow ) get through first book , ' wideacre ' , which i disliked - whilst i adore rest gregory novels , so this hard me - grit my teeth tried read this book , sequel i'd bought it it looked more promising . it ' marginally better ' one reader put it , than first , but very depressing frustrating book indeed . i getting very angry frustrated after second half book - many other readers highlighted , julia consistent inability stand up richard made it impossible me like her anymore . i quite honestly wanted slap her wake her up dreamy state she ! because i wanted so much julia james - who i liked great deal . i so depressed after everything went wrong she didn't marry him ... ah , because i expecting usually very clever ms gregory surprise me twist end say , aha ! she get her true love end she ralph get rid richard although it not happily ever after she learns grow backbone very first female heir wideacre . rape scene julia richard very violent far too detailed i think it may difficult stomach anyone who ever abusive situation like , fact , anyone all . i don't want get into tricky area abortion too much , but i really feel strongly julia should gone ralph help when she concieved child richard . this child incest rape - she knew her heart there should no heir wideacre - they all simply too inbred it needed end somewhere nothing going right . clean slate , so speak . yet she gives child away - then her final letter asks james find child ?! what ?! i expecting perhaps deformed child , after all this inbreeding ( i mean this child product parents who brother sister grandparents who brother sister !!! ) but she perfect beautiful . i hoping gypsies would keep her she'd never found again .. but alas , lacey madness live ... perfect end this book would nice twist . gregory could made her very good point inheritance rights lack power women beatrice julia era richard killed ralph , then julia inheriting land - baby sarah adopted out gypsies never seen again julia either lives widow runs land or ( this would lovely - i bet all girls sighed over james little , didn't you ? he little like handsome romantic leads austen books ) james forgave her - they both made mistakes julia not intentional nor her fault ( i practically screaming her it wasn't her fault - she gets it end , when it too late ! ) they marry ' normal ' children - or perhaps none , they just learn their mistakes respect each other , make fresh start wideacre . there so many allies julia - she sweet girl i liked her - i wish i could shaken her though , i got so mad . so many people village offered their help - this trap she caught richard could avoided - ahhh ... so frustrating . i not reading third book series . i shall go back reading gregory more historic novels ( constant princess one i haven't read yet it sounds excellent ) . i wouldn't recommend this one	-1
this far my favorite stephen king novel . i not hear any fanfare when it came out but purchased it break dark tower novels . novel surprise its unique story depth . unlike lot stephen king novels deal darkening human spirit , this novel delves more into hope . there bad men , " low men yellow coats ( wonderful phrase ! ) " but there also concrete good world characters trying hold onto . king weaves two different decades makes connections not overly coincidental or trite . he also gives few nods his dark tower works , but they not overt . you not read series . they more treat his long term readers universe he trying create throughout his novels . i highly recommend this book ( but don't fooled movie , it weak comparison )	1

`the iraq war ' eminent english military historian journalist , john keegan model reflective reporting recent major historical event , bringing bear all keegan insight into anglo-american history military practice . starters , i strongly disagree those reviewers who felt keegan gives us too much background least two reasons . first , actual military campaign so short , narrative it would hardly fill book half this size . second , background much more interesting much less well known those us who followed every move third infantry division first marine expeditionary force cnn day day kuwait baghdad . most immediate lesson i got this book fact central command commander , general tommy franks good or better commander than his colleague commander 1991 gulf war , `stormin norman schwarzkopf ' . if franks impressed keegan who studied analyzed every major conflict 20th century , i no doubt franks good man military task hand . corollary lesson this immediate military task , franks fact enough troops accomplish immediate capitulation iraqi armed forces . this not mean there enough coalition forces nail things down after initial success it certainly not mean frank civilian superiors washington really understood iraqi situation either before war began or after coalition gained nominal control country . most interesting aspects keegan summary actual combat fact regular iraqi troops simply melted away approach american or british heavy units , heaviest resistance came neither regular troops nor elite republican guard , but `fedayeen ' irregulars , many whom actually islamic fanatics neighboring countries such syria . native iraqis so uninterested war civilians routinely wandered into combat areas often mistaken fedayeen fanatics . interesting aspect keegan narrative combat his characterization overwhelming superiority american uk troops over their iraqi opponents . iraqi equipment bought soviets least two generations behind allied gear third fourth rate troops simply no match elite marines , airborne divisions , first line 3rd infantry division ( which actually more like armored division world war ii days ) . eminently balanced reporter historian , i very happy see his outsider assessment american troops commanders , especially those periods end march , example , when so many commentators prophesying doom gloom what nothing more than holdup desert storm order supply lines catch up forward troops . really interesting stuff comes background chapters . one surprise how such seemingly small events sway tide history , how european american public alarmed when western journalist executed iraq , after thousands natives purged not so much flicker interest . influence then prime minister margaret thatcher first president bush consider military action against saddam 1991 . even more interesting material book contrast saddam generally secular regime contrasted fundamentalist islam regimes iran other middle eastern countries . keegan not draw any significant conclusions this , but he very effectively paints picture makes cooperation iraq al quaida seem very unlikely . possibly single most interesting observation comes page 54 where keegan explains mystery why islam , which leading source learning thought over 700 years , turns its back independent reasoning future directs faithful more oriented past . this same time ( 15th 16th centuries ) when western christian church accommodating reason scientific inquiry , leading technological prominence western europe time went . people who looking strong , concrete reasons why we should or should not invaded iraq 2003 not find them this book , although keegan offer plenty factual material help people make up their own minds these issues . but , even keegan admits he not yet whole story leaves some questions open very end . any balanced view invasion iraq should take this narrative into account .	1

somewhat unorthodox christian , i am not opposed efforts revisit earliest sources christian tradition order discern original teachings jesus his followers . it indeed quite possible - even probable - those teachings underwent transformation development , some these developments eventually ran contrary original teachings . there books follow this process way intellectually respectable based sound scholarship ; this book - unfortunately - not one them . this book appeal those who despise orthodox christianity yet feel compelling need reinterpret christianity according their subjective psychological needs . such people , facts not matter , any theory which radically reinterprets traditional christianity - no matter how far-fetched - find ready audience . those who want views early christianity pay attention historical facts , i recommend - without necessarily agreeing - scholarly works geza vermes , raymond brown , bart ehrman , marcus borg , . . wright , even bishop spong ( if you insist ultra-liberalism ) . not waste your money rubbish aptly-named timothy freke .	-1

this type novel most writers naught but aspire craft ! i first introduced this novel my sophomore year high school . ( far what misguided reviewer below posted , i not protest , but devoured every bit this breathtaking work art ! ) i instantly captured unique writing style well remarkable story , , needless say , this book remains one my favorite - if not my very favorite - novels i assigned read high school . novel written three different narratives , told primarily documentary fashion , giving it feel epic . story follows three generations women trueba family , whose patriarch selfish , dictatorial , but ultimately understandable esteban trueba . naming female characters story specifically symbolize purity ( " blanca " means " white " spanish , while " clara , " " nivea , " " alba " embody clarity , snow , dawn respectively ) , allende deliberately explores feminism , setting her story society which thrives conservative , chauvinistic ideals . which brings me violence . yes , there rape scenes ; let me explain : allende , this point story , trying convey absolute horror esteban trueba relations peasant girls ( metaphor mistreatment working class upper class , also mistreatment women men , expanding allende notions feminism ) . scenes explicit because they meant shocking infuriating great degree . far making this novel " abhorrent , " these scenes add emotional impact story . who like this book : -readers who appreciate well-worded , well-crafted classic-feminists-readers who don't mind shocked or disturbed certain scenes meant shocking disturbing-readers who empathize profound , colorful , developed characters-readers who love broad , eventful plotlines hidden meanings , metaphors , symbolism-readers who don't mind bit magic realism ! -readers who appreciate story which plays out like musicwho not like this book : -readers who cannot stand feminism or open chauvinists-readers who cannot tolerate shocking or explicit scenes-readers who easily offended glorification radical or liberal ideas ( record , homosexuality not glorified but stated simple , existing part world , much like existence concepts such feminism , prejudice , true love)with exception above mentioned audience , i guarantee this book keep its reader turning pages ! masterpiece	1

i've read lot books buddhism various flavors - zen , tibetan , etc . most zen books i've read either very abstract , or very straightforward but lacking detail how practice day-to-day . cheri huber written ultimate book pretty much buzzword-free extremely simple put test . /suffering optional/ not really buddhist book , or zen book . it happens written zen teacher , there few buddhist-y words ( mostly " karma " ) used highlight points which western culture tends lack solid terminology . but most part , this simply book freeing yourself ways you ( often unknowingly ) punish yourself . suffering indeed optional , cheri huber shows how see tha t.t his very fast , very simple read , but not fooled . /suffering optional/ not set out some pie-in-the-sky path happiness involves no effort your part . quite opposite , author herself quick point out : " i remind people annoying regularity if this practice easy it would more popular . consider , please . look around see what thousands or even millions ' adherents .

i read mr. harris ' book . i quite disagree his ideas , just i find him , writer , quite disagreeable . there some threads his book hold one fascination , or even which earn one admiration . some his ideas such apparent originality one must applaud him sake them . his insight into ancient spartan society , example , one these . nevertheless , this reader disagrees use which author puts his insights , well conclusions he draws them . truth , his conclusions not conclusions , but actually his own prior assumptions , dressed up conclusions . it should apparent any astute reader author , this work , set out simply justify , any way he , his prior conclusions evils liberal democracy , liberal " intellectuals , " arab societies , internationalism . his effort this , he repeatedly stoops use fallacious arguments , misrepresent others either outright dissimulation or ad hominem attack , ( unconvincingly ) dress up his assumptions conclusions . mr. harris compares people leadership contemporary united states people leadership 16th century aztecs . specifically , he compares events september 11 , 2001 , those cortez conquest aztecs . he argues ( thanks " liberal intellectuals " ) we ignorant islamic terrorism terrorists montezuma strange men who arrived mexico peak aztec empire . condense his argument , he claims we failed understand nature 9/11 attack nature those who perpetrated it , just montezuma failed understand nature spaniards ' sudden appearance . he says we , like aztecs ( again , thanks " liberal intellectuals " ) , giving islamic militants too much break , not recognizing them what they -- purely evil , irrationally motivated , utterly indifferent anyone else , finally he accuses us incapable recognizing who , who not , enemy , any more . but fact west long history islamic world , we understand their motivations , we cannot claim mystified their feelings thoughts - short , we not , fact , position anything like montezuma his aztec empire . if there any truth author thesis all , one not need cite twice-removed theorizing " liberal intellectuals " see where truth most evident - one need only look bush administration . america attacked group saudis reasons largely american military presence saudi arabia , bush response transparently fabricate bogus connections 9/11 iraq , then attack iraq , conveniently ignoring , failing largely explore , real threads led 9/11 - saudi money , pakistani support protection taliban , truly deplorable history western relations middle east . if we apply harris ' comparison , it would bush who takes place montezuma , bush who misunderstands nature , even identity , enemy , bush whose " fantasy ideology " propelled him into grievous misadventure impossible quagmire . i don't know any " liberal intellectuals " well enough speak them , but i know this liberal , many , many others stood behind america attack al-qaeda taliban afghanistan , precisely because we recognize nature identity enemy . liberals , intellectual or otherwise , took view only after we saw bush turning away pursuit terrorists , making shameful use 9/11 carry out his pre-assigned task : invade iraq establish permanent bases there order exercise hegemony middle eastern oil fields make neat profit halliburton , while he it . but , turning back mr. harris , he wishes us regard this " new " enemy inexplicable implacable force evil toward which we must show no quarter , even point taking no interest all what might actually motivating them , what might effect change them , or what strategies we might adopt , other than one entailing their total merciless destruction us . his extraordinary thesis , thesis defies well-established principles human political behavior , this enemy simply hates us who what we , no identifiable cause or causes , their sheer unreasonableness sufficient motivation them wage desperate , even self-destructive war against us , no matter what it costs them . it impossible anyone pretend west not long history islamic peoples middle east , one which west not always villain , but which traces , nevertheless , unbroken story exploitation , political meddling ( including deliberate destruction true democracy iran ) , manipulation , encouragement conflict , encouragement crimes against humanity , what many muslims see absolutely unqualified support israel all its actions . what author here nothing more than demonize islamic world disregarding our actual history them . mr. harris ' prescription , pretty much line well-known pnac neoconservatives , we abandon any all diplomatic means , we abandon international cooperation , we abandon our own principles , including those congruent geneva convention , order destroy this enemy utterly , any cost ourselves or people middle east . frankly , spite his carefully constructed philosophical rationalizations , this conclusion incorrect unwarranted history it constitutes " fantasy ideology " every bit mistaken delusional osama bin-laden . finally , this reader found certain violations logic good faith mr. harris ' book . while these , alone , may or may not any bearing mr. harris ' major argument , one nevertheless distressed , made distrustful , his willingness stoop such means . one example this where author misrepresents statements richard butler , chief arms inspector united nations . 2002 , mr. butler suggested it unseemly united states insist upon no development or acquisition nuclear weapons presently non-nuclear nations , while u.s. , same time , not only refuses back away nuclear weapons itself , but even developing new forms nuclear weapons intimating our willingness actually use them theater . mr. harris presents mr. butler argument if butler actually advocating " no double standard " development or acquisition nuclear weapons non-nuclear nations . fact , mr. butler intent point out united states , refusing any adjustment its own position nuclear weapons , doing very little justify its demands upon others or encourage them , fact , not pursue nuclear weapons . without visibly making up facts , mr. harris nonetheless , i believe deliberately , twisted words mr. butler mean something they not mean . mr. harris also attacks martha nusbaum essay behalf cosmopolitanism , " patriotism vs . cosmopolitanism . " he hangs his attack first essay reference famous greek , diogenes , then switches his attack anything ms. nusbaum may written , choosing instead launch ad hominem attacks essentially irrelevant ( not mention ancient ) diogenes - pointing out , example , diogenes said masturbated publicly agora . while ms. nusbaum essay her ideas really not based apocryphal doings sayings diogenes , it satisfies mr. harris ' intellectual standards simply smear intellectual ad hominem attack long-dead , imperfectly remembered greek buffoon . readers integrity find this sort deliberately shoddy reasoning throughout mr. harris ' book . if many readers adopt mr. harris ' views , despite obvious flaws his reasoning despite intellectual dishonesty permeates his book , they so their own peril . like montezuma , they failed recognize dangerous enemy when he standing right before them .	-1

south florida television meteorologist bryan norcross earned local rock-star status even some national notoriety his commendable reporting before , during , after hurricane andrew strike miami 1992 . now norcross authored hurricane almanac . norcross states book he hopes produce annual updates book . perhaps future editions better fleshed out , but inaugural version quite number rough spots . my main issue book whenever section begins become interesting useful reader thinks some in-depth advice analysis follow , section ends abruptly . reader often then urged check accompanying website norcross helped start order get more detail . but such detail fact not currently available site , which basically contains only some links other sites where one may buy batteries , etc ., bulk . course rome wasn't built day , maybe site far more useful future years . but if he going specifically title book " hurricane almanac 2006 " include repeated references supposedly helpful website , he responsibility actually provide useful information during 2006 hurricane season . otherwise , it would better him just wait until 2007 it righ t.t he book seems rushed into print , which might explain ( though not excuse ) lack detail . norcross acknowledgments imply there severe time rush . perhaps publishers norcross wanted least get something out there this year . " something " often better than nothing , but not always . sometimes it better just say nothing rather than give half story . i know number south floridians who feel although norcross far ahead his counterparts other tv stations 1992 , gap narrowed or even altogether eliminated recent years . it isn't norcross unintelligent , but he become somewhat preachy scolding . he given relentlessly lecturing his audience , where some newer area meteorologists seem more flexible willing not only constantly recite basics , needed , but sometimes go beyond them . i mention this here because this same unhelpful patronizing attitude comes across numerous points book . instance , norcross first bullet point what or not during storm once winds reach 40 mph not any open flame . true necessary say . but then right below , " what when winds reach 60 " section , he says same thing ( all caps ) . it still true , but it still also blindingly obvious . same pattern unnecessary repetition occurs his almost-identical long lists how home dwellers should deal storm how high-rise dwellers should deal one . this more editing flaw than authorial one ; editors should condensed confusingly similar lists one large one common all circumstances , plus few shorter ones address problems specific living tall buildings , example . then there just too much plain mastery obvious . consider this bit advice norcross , example : " i little solar-powered radio . it works well long it sun , meaning it doesn't work well night . " well , that certainly true statement . if you're sort person who would normally expect their solar-powered devices run well midnight , it may even news you . but i'm betting it probably isn't . then there times when norcross throws out useful suggestions , but without enough explanation or follow-up . different points he lists several ways which bathtub may put good use hurricane : it may filled water used later sanitary purposes , or people may shelter themselves it mattress over them protection during storm , or valuables may placed it protection . maybe these each useful suggestions , taken individually . but there no attempt made coordinate these very different ideas . newcomers hurricane country might still no idea who or what should actually placed into their bathtub(s ) storm approaches . book contains overview what tropical systems how they form . it somewhat helpful section how read interpret national hurricane center various advisories other statements . it brief though interesting overview notable historical storms , which apparently culled other books ( especially pre-1870 storms ) . it long sections how prepare act during storm . these sections me most disappointing ; length my opinion misused constant repetition same few points instead detailed explanation . section various window-protection products not nearly detailed enough ( terms brands , etc . ) , i said repeated referrals book website provided no additional help . norcross also includes section how he would it ( better ) . despite his credentials expertise , i mostly unimpressed his suggestions , chiefly because most just general concepts thrown out there without any specificity or much attempt meet possible objections . instance , he calls strongly " national catastrophe fund , " but his fund just title without program behind it . he doesn't even attempt give any estimates what such program would cost , what it would cover , etc . would it pay people rebuild still dangerous low-lying sections flooded new orleans , instance ? might some landlords or investors not bother even protect their property if they knew government going come afterwards reimburse them any losses ? if so , couldn't " cure " worse than disease , terms leading still more future tragedy loss ? one suggestion i find very convincing his proposal storm-proofing expenses routinely added homeowners ' mortgages . norcross wisely points out , it lot more practical possible many homeowners add $ 10,000 existing $200 , 000 , thirty-year mortgage pay safety way than come up same $ 10,000 ( or more ) one lump sum . lenders mortgage holders should more than willing work homeowners this regard , protecting home protects their investment . notice way this one truly useful suggestion one contained actual numerical estimates . word almanac 300 page length might suggest some people this fairly sizeable , densely-packed work . if so , would incorrect assumption . book doesn't half content 600 page " world almanac , " example , or even one tenth or one twentieth such content . print large , line spacing generous , white space predominates throughout . there really wasn't enough written fill whole book ; it more very extended faq or pamphlet than it almanac . again , future editions this book this may well change . book could serve good outline what its successor books should look like . but right now , it not much use i would discourage anyone purchasing work its present status	-1

his cold war classic , unbearable lightness , milan kundera expounds , " there infinite difference robespierre who occurs only once history robespierre who eternally returns , chopping off french heads . " his own cold war classic , william appleman williams investigates " tragedy terror " american foreign policy , subverting our american ideals humanity self-determination then continually forgetting , chopped off heads ad infinitum . " tragedy american diplomacy , " williams traces open door policy , its articulation open door notes mckinley administration its culmination , when it became engrained minds cold warriors like truman kennan . open door became internalized perhaps why it , like kundera robespierre , " eternally returns . " ruling class continually turned open door , which basically holds our internal tensions economic problems solved not here home but transforming rest world our liking , all while thinking they've struck upon something entirely new . williams writes , " among many ironies kennan policy containment , perhaps greatest fact he so internalized assumptions principles open door policy he thought he proposing radically different program . " this sharp historical analysis , if " tragedy " filled only likes it , essay would still cold war classic . but it philosophical weight such what follows this critique kennan leaves " tragedy " full meaning relevance fifteen years after fall berlin wall : " this indeed final act transformation utopia into ideology . " i write , it 2004 american forces occupy iraq . whether you agree bush rationale war or not , you should understand it not some new doctrine ; whatever he tells us , september 11 , 2001 not " change everything ; " nor bush neocons first dream up such utopia . like kennan , however , those who led us war believed they doing something radically different . like kennan containment , iraq war fact just swing open door policy first opened spanish-american war ( which also devolved military victory over tyranny into more ambiguous crushing native insurgency ) . way , leaders such senator vandenburg , he admitted candid moment , realized need " scare hell out american people . " williams laments vandenberg likeminded elites " consciously employ exaggeration oversimplification accomplish their objectives . " ( odd foreshadowing 2004 , williams 1972 revision opens young vietnam veteran turned protester named john forbes kerry asking , " how you ask man last man die mistake ? " ) clearly then , williams much teach us still today . williams not preach despair . he hopeful america might find transcendence , karl jaspers defined it , tragic , looking historical mirror brutal honesty then acting humanely , armed truth . he hoped america might stop smashing local revolutions while calling them soviet plots , instead turn our focus inward , show world how people live peacefully democratically . 1972 edition i read , williams concludes holding up chile inspiration self-determination . few months after he wrote this , nixon administration , particularly henry kissinger , made sure there'd no more self-determination chile . president allende death september 11 , 1973 , installation murderous war criminal pinochet dictator , open door , executioner axe , kept swinging .	1

i begin criticisms high crimes misdemeanors . these nagging little criticisms i make because points i'll allude sorts things would make me roll my eyes little , or excuse myself couple minutes breather if this conversation rather than book . ms. coulter suffered fate all those who seek insert comic relief or sarcasm into serious material . witticisms , sarcasm , barbed ironies , sage observations , facts , foregone conclusions , research don't always blend perfectly suit all people all time . some ( perhaps little mean-spirited ) humor expense liberals , i found sophomoric and/or repetitive and/or little snide . there , i've gone record , let me say me , these irritations accounted 12 sentences book . usually they kickers " call response " , or wrap-up rhetorical statement or question . i tried bear mind i really didn't buy this book comedy . rest book , i cannot give more stellar praise . without apology , i say this , time , only book its kind i ever read . past month or so , i've since read other coulter books . distinguish myself several reviewers , i read entire book . bibliography , references annotations impressive . i didn't or take time trace down every one them . owing largely addition , i seem remember someone else taking issue ann coulter fact-checking accuracy , coming away figuratively bloodied nose his trouble . if ( liberal ) you'll allow quotes documentation check out , i'll allow ( conservative ) there * always * opportunity contextual disagreement or more thorough research into any given blurb or quote . qualify this review , i am mostly conservative , i believe united states , i believe my fellow americans , i believe morals , right vs . wrong high standard ethics should applied , indeed expected our political leaders ( well business leaders , religious leaders , teachers , law enforcement , lawyers , judges , etc ., etc . ) . things i don't believe persecution human beings based sexuality , race , religion , creed , or politics . i also don't believe liberals stupid . i believe select people stupid independent political affiliation , but different longer story ... all this say , if you feel you should discount or hearken my review based who i am , you now know some basics person whom you already mentally primed agree or disagree . ( yes , i know i should've just ended sentence preposition ... it bothered me ) if , your mind , i'm still neocon fanatic , hopped up reagan kool-aid , fine . i still my best honestly evaluate this book . facts citations ms. coulter used build her case seem airtight . logic she used , witticisms criticisms aside , made sense me . i am astounded what i've learned . spin machine she described leaps bounds beyond anything i imagined after seen movie " wag dog " . person who tries whittle things down essentials , then move , i really understand how inundation conflicting stories , viewpoints assertions basically paralyzes american voter/citizen . it no wonder president clinton wasn't removed office . time matter put vote , issues truly hand obfuscated misrepresented so fully , ( most nation -in my remembrance- convinced whole thing monica ) no one person seemed credible grasp truth . clarify , it wasn't monica . it * * sex , but not wholesome , middle-america sex , so hale beautiful . notably , not kind sex correctly omitted polite conversation because it personal virtuous expression partners ( rather than acquaintances ) . quite likely , though most don't know why , we all feel little dirty , perhaps little ashamed endured whole messy affair . sex scandals ( plural ) white house definitely something this country could without . though i wish it hadn't happened , i'm glad i've found out more details this episode u.s. history . book nothing if not annotated details , quotations , recorded testimony , truth , highly cogent damning lambasting our former president . you indignant , you enlightened , you puzzle how these quotes tidbits escaped your attention during media frenzy . if you're willing admit there surpassingly effective spin machine somewhere maryland virginia , you feel justified your suspicions more went than we told . moreover , this book interesting sex scandals like part two four book . i found pre-presidency late-second-term material more interesting , more telling , foremost more genuinely horrifying . truth known , president clinton could adultered , thus shamed his wife child , ultimately office president all who salute it until cows came home , he would only met mild disapproval me . jfk notorious just more . fdr mistress . poor gary hart ... i digress . public figures imperfect , ( if not deeply flawed ) corrupt , philandering , disingenuous , cloying base since politics began . i read lines book , time passed , clintons getting better bolder their many sundry misbehaviors . stakes went up , their skill increased . i further surprised find out much evidence indicates mrs. clinton lynchpin whole criminal enterprise ( several them , fact ) . note mrs. clinton not just lawyer , but hailed brilliant lawyer . erstwhile senator new york may well fairly accomplished criminal well . though i can't call these arguments against clintons surprising , i am profoundly dismayed apparent snow-job ( couldn't resist ) perpetrated against american public . before you vote hillary ' 08 , you should read this book . if you vote her afterwards , fine . we agree disagree ... but , if you got your news cnn during this tumultuous time , please read high crimes misdemeanors first . i am pliable suggestions books or articles offer plausible defense against accusations this book ( say , i am not inviting rabid , bush-hating emails , etc ... i could more pleased bush too ) . if work cites facts verifiable evidence , not opinion invective , i read it thankfully . meanwhile , you should read this , see if you agree , try debunk which you doubt , prove yourself you're reasonable , thoughtful truly impartial seeker truth . i surmise you stunned , i	1

i am trying not cry while writing this review because incredible impact this great work judith herman my life . i first read book 4 years ago ( i 19 time ) , suggestion my therapist . today it remains one only two books topic i kept . i never let go this book . this probably most comprehensive book ptsd ever written . it lauded just every psychologist i ever met . i extensive field knowledge area psychology just based experience self-education , this book clinician book fullest . it exceedingly intelligent , informed , compassionate all once . people who read this book not ptsd find it heartbreaking difficult -- people who ptsd read this book find it life-shattering . that where it starts . it starts extremely in-depth look biological underpinnings ptsd , concept narrative memory vs . traumatic memory , discussion studies indicated survivors process traumatic memory brain differently than they process normal , or narrative memory . underlying message outset people who survived trauma dealing fractured schemas fragmented concepts self -- whereas people who survived prolonged , repeated trauma early life never able form cohesive self or schema first place . other words , we're building scratch . i don't believe me more terrifying words ever spoken . herman language deeply compassionate but almost surgical its painful precision . she so thoroughly educated validating it hard not nauseated because it so true it so real ... she makes it real concrete , scientific sense , more than just emotional , " i'm okay , you're okay " sense . you realize first time ptsd isn't just bunch jumbled feelings , but systematic medical disorder very predictable symptoms psychological implications . that where hope begins -- once you understand ptsd symptoms same everyone -- whether war veteran , survivor domestic abuse , terrorism , or natural disaster -- you realize how not alone you really . nearly everyone experienced something traumatic , but only 15% develop ptsd result . complex-ptsd ( prolonged , repeated trauma ) even rarer . it easy feel alone because it not something people often talk . but this book makes you confident , not only you aren't alone , but what you suffering real professionally recognized medical condition . once you learn your disorder back forward , you learn how recognize its stages how treat it . you don't see it who you anymore , but rather external force you learning cope . you recognize your strength survivor . more importantly , you learn take those fragmented pieces " traumatic memory " form them into cohesive " narrative " memory . you learn speak unspeakable . it not easy speak unspeakable , voice forbidden black horrible thoughts ... but once you , you learn they aren't so horrible when exposed daylight . everything makes sense again . black hole traumatic memory loses its power , while sense whole complete sense self , includes , but not revolve around trauma , gains upper hand . imagine life where you don't think trauma every day , where sounds smells feelings don't haunt you every turn . imagine life where you describe your trauma story " boring . " it sounded impossible me time , but it reality obtained , her book , j.h. lays out precisely how this millions survivors worldwide . whenever anybody i know makes light ptsd or tries play it off like not real illness or something i control , i throw this book all knowledge i gained their face . people can't argue judith . she knows what she talking . if you survivor trauma or sufferer ptsd , this best possible book read . this source which all knowledge springs . 100,000 other books ptsd use this one their knowledge base . judith herman owns . this not book talks gently you . it doesn't try protect you . it clinician book . it uses technical terminology . if you unsafe space or feeling mentally unstable , don't read it , or read it very slowly . my husband headed ph . clinical psychology read countless books abnormal psychology . he read this book better understand me . this day he maintains it single most emotionally difficult book he ever read his life . best part this book , it equisitely re-readable . i came back it after three years . i found it didn't tear me apart way it first time . instead i looking myself awe : " look what i up against . look what . look what i information my life ! " seriously , i cannot reccomend this book enough . it validation education one . it beautifully written , classic work psychological research forever change way you look yourself or your loved one	1

aptly named , my life spans time bill clinton birth hope , arkansas , inauguration george . bush 43rd president . one imagine how difficult it write subject such large scope . clinton devotes first hundred pages or so his boyhood adolescence hot springs , arkansas . events this portion book not extraordinary , but clinton good gift storytelling , so i found his recounting his childhood interesting . level political commentary this portion very little , so potential readers adverse clinton views don't need worry here . next part book , 250 pages , covers clinton enrollment georgetown , oxford , yale law school . here clinton writings become more political , since he worked several campaigns arkansas his senator washington . clinton also describes himself thinking presidency early high school , accounting his enrolling georgetown ( washington , . . ) , despite never visiting campus or knowing anyone there . after graduating yale , clinton moved back arkansas almost immediately into politics . this point , my life concerned primarily clinton political career arkansas white house . early years , consisting his failed run congress , his tenure attorney general , his first term governor , depict young man fresh out law school sometimes struggling connect ordinary people arkansas . clinton very candid discussing his shortcomings these years , more so than his later political life . accounts backwoods campaigning deal making written good fashion , both interesting relevant clinton development politician . those familiar arkansas love this portion book . appropriately , majority my life covers time span late 1991 early 2001 , starting clinton announcement presidency . starting presidency , clinton covers his life almost day-to-day fashion , even covering mundane aspects presidency . i found it interesting ; some may find it boring . i learned great deal various international , domestic , political struggles era . one problem , though , sometimes i felt i needed history textbook keep up everything . clinton jumps one event next , sometimes so much it hard keep everything straight . i stopped caring remembering names clinton staff various world leaders halfway through . problem presidential portion book high level political commentary , especially during impeachment proceedings . often , clinton reads if he delivering campaign speech entire time , continually trying make his point reader . though it interesting know clinton thoughts , preaching becomes tedious rather quickly . meetings clinton national world leaders covered very well contain many examples behind-closed-doors types action i mentioned before . overall , this portion book good account day-to-day life president , told very detailed , first-person style . my life recommended anyone who interested life 42nd president , well history past twenty years . it interesting story enjoyed almost anyone .	1

" envisioning information " edward tufte further fleshes out expands work he presenting information . this volume best suited designers complex information such maps or schedules . his other books , it richly illustrated many colorful examples well poorly designed information displays . this good book get one thinking information displays , but putting them into practice more challenging . although much what tufte criticizes displays could considered " nitpicking , " his points merit , albeit very difficult put into practice one own work not model his examples . personally , i not agree all his criticisms what considered ideal , extent , subjective . there also some personal opinions he could left out book . example , author uses example digton rock show how people viewing rock various perceptions ( . 73 ) . wonderful . however , there he throws his mockery dismissing its origin anything other than native-american . he goes state , " such logic places vikings far inland , deep into what now west virginia ohio " this " scholarship wishful thinking .

i wish i written " mission-based marketing , " consultant peter brinckerhoff smart , well-written book . certainly title terrific , underscoring it only effective marketing nonprofit mission-based . but more than brinckerhoff written basic book marketing nonetheless propounds some very advanced views . " mission-based marketing , " its companion workbook " mission-based marketing : organizational development workbook , " largely book reluctant novice nonprofit marketer , his board or staff . there lot handholding here , including lengthy treatises subjects `competition ' ( it ultimately good , he says ) `flexibility ' ( it even better ) . same token , " mission-based " conspicuously free basic marketing concepts like " four ps . " there little substance pricing theory , nothing much branding , pet subject most for-profit marketing mavens . instead , brinckerhoff starts laying out plain-spoken english why nonprofits who may thought marketing `sales ' thereby unsavory , get past idea . he calls such thinking " non-profit marketing disability . " it stems , he says , knowing what your constituents " need " caring little what they " want ; " filling wants defining thereby unsavory element for-profit marketing . but brinckerhoff easily dispatches non-profit marketing disability before twentieth page . matter , he takes starch out taint sales while he it . imagine would-be client treatment facility dangerous herself or others , he suggests . client needs treatment , but she doesn't want it . since she adult , you can't force her into treatment . but you market her , this case `sell ' her treatment . " job mission-based marketer make person want what they need , " he says . ergo , " good marketing good mission . " nice ! even all handholding , there still plenty relevant here more sophisticated mission-based marketers , especially chapters customer service marketing planning . but it testament value validity this book i finished " mission-based marketing " same time i reading issue " marketing management , " magazine published american marketing association , i found them markedly similar . several scholar-members ama proposed changing product-centric four ps marketing mix customer-centric " siva , " [ solutions , information , value access ] . this cutting-edge thinking leading lights world largest marketing membership group , it mirrors broad strokes brinckerhoff central themes . i quibbles , but they're minor . chapter five marketing cycle , he takes his 6-part customer-centric approach , so similar siva , out trot . second stage " market inquiry " or " what your markets really want ? " presumes you actually discover what your markets really want . while brinckerhoff soundly recommends " asking , asking , listening " it not necessarily given you discover what your customer wants simply asking them . customer may not know , or able articulate what he wants . not all marketers or market researchers capable parsing out those hidden wants , either . plus , any customer-centric approach not-for-profit or for-profit marketing runs risk merely reactive ; not innovating . no focus group ever suggested original sony walkman , instance . instead , it birthed minds engineers who knew what possible , sold marketers who knew how make people want something they never conceived . mission-based marketing well-wrought book , excellent resource , terrific addition any mission-based marketer library	1

beckett " krapp last tape " doesn't seem get respect it deserves drama critics because it always set up against his other works . it lacks tremendous absurdity " waiting godot " or " endgame " but it its fair share . some respects " krapp lasttape " much more human face than others : we understand krapp much more than gogo or didi . this serves make him someone whom we more easily identify , therefore , makes him more tragic . essential question this play raises " who krapp ? " it old man we see stage ? it his voice decades earlier ? or he krapp one tape he returns again again ? krapp real then killed consummed bitter man shoving bananas down his throat ? consequently , we discover he all none these . life not static thing ; it constantly changes . , like krapp , we either embrace or resent what we our lives . this terrific play , , my humble ( i mean humble ) opinion , samuel beckett best	1

this long biography capote covers writer birth death , appears comprehensive . mostly it easy read fascinating character well great author . i can't give it five stars however , since i feel it problems several areas . first , author spends too much time capote childhood . alright already , he weird childhood . so most people these days ! it dragged far too long expense more interesting periods where five years could fly one ( short ) chapter . second , there should introductory chapter ny high society before author disclussed capote voyage through it . sort what painter french high society before describing how proust entered it . this would useful because no one remembers who these people anymore ( i adult time ny ) or worse , only remembers them because they friends or foes , or both , capote . so book dated respect ; reading it 2006 it seems like capote conferring social distinction rather trying acquire it . finally paperback cover absolutely weird . i know it tie movie , but instead picture capote it picture seymour hoffman playing capote . bizzare . it would like biography lincoln picture raymond massey cover . considering hoffman didn't even mention capote academy awards , it truely strange	1

there some really excellent detailed reviews already posted here , i try not duplicate their efforts . however benefit those considering whether purchase this book i make some brief observations . first , this book demonstrates why tufte continues more or less unique field technical graphical communications . his broad sweep his high equal concern aesthetics , cognitive decision science , principles handling evidence , intellectual integrity all combine produce uniquely valuable examples how help facts tell their otherwise often hidden story . each tufte books , including this one , clearly labor love his part , even point sometimes annoyingly painstaking . i almost don't want sully his books my scrawled margin notes diagrams ( but i anyway , there just too much there think resist it ! ) . second , i think tufte rightly accused keeping same basic presentation relatively minor variation ever since his first remarkable brilliant book series . if you just want know principles he espouses , you could probably just buy first book not bother rest . it leading example illustrating core principles example after detailed example exceptional visual displays information subsequent books , including beautiful evidence , add value corpus . there some idiosyncrasies here don't really pertain evidence , such photos tufte own sculptures , but these arguably add certain charm presentation sometimes help illustrate unusual breadth author application principles . i don't find them particularly useful , but i've spoken others different interests who found them fascinating addition . third , tufte work , all its inspiration care , not detailed enough stand its own course technical graphical communication . you need supplement it education graphing techniques , statistics , decision making , evidence handling , so , order apply principles real novel cases . his main value culling universal principles all these fields help guide their application real world unique circumstances . beautiful evidence , like tufte previous books series , illustrates masterpieces technical communications why they masterpieces , it doesn't offer step step instructions recreating them . his best , tufte inspires your own genius , bridging art science , he doesn't offer algorithm creating graphs . i think worst you could say beautiful evidence same tufte work general , he become rather repetitive his explanations , may often tantalize you brilliances you may never able learn or apply . best i often try remember examples tufte books there may better way communicate information , there may often value or least inspiration perusing what really clever people similar information past , rather than just applying boilerplate graph problem . most useful specific things i gotten beautiful evidence so far concept sparklines embed quantitatve context elegantly into text , particularly cogent description tufte general principles , his detailed analysis " cognitive style " bullet list presentations found so widely presentations . those who , like me , never tire seeing masterful examples communicating technical information , inspired them improve their own communications , even find these examples beautiful well elegant , this book very welcome rewarding addition .	1

blame it new jersey public schools , if you like . i find they're always handy scapegoat . because - though i blush confess it - i first came across emily bronte classic tale undying love people confusingly similar names , wuthering heights , when i saw glamorous , romantic 1939 film story , not when i read actual grim gritty 1847 novel . this may explain why , long time , when i thought novel hero , heathcliff , i thought heroic-looking , sad-eyed laurence oliver , consequently held this famous brooder rather high esteem . i so no longer , reason why summed up two words - john sutherland . this professor scholar , heathcliff murderer ?, put some greatest novels western literature under microscope , found out all their inconsistencies flaws . he looks classic literature new perspective , asking intriguing questions its novels , offering solutions problems they raise - putting new spins onto books which most people probably feel they already know inside out . i , example , thought i knew something character heathcliff , until i read sutherland essay him , his various deeds doings . after reading this book ( which discusses works bronte , charles dickens , jane austen , george eliot , amongst many others ) i guarantee you look some your favorite books entirely new way - see depths , puzzles , inconsistencies them you never saw before . i , one , now greet laurence olivier entrance screen wuthering heights boo rather rude hand gesture , rather than pinkening cheek fluttering lash . such power heathcliff murderer	1
if you're looking rip-roaring yarn hoary old prospectors jumping claims battling over gold nuggets , this not it . johnson book thoughtful work social history reexamines collective memory many people gold rush ( all-american gold-diggin ' brawl ) context letters , diary entries , legal cases ballads people who actually * * gold rush used document their lives . picture emerges one complex society grew up around promise instant wealth . one thing , americans not ( johnson account ) always largest group miners southern mines : french guardsmen expelled their country , chilean aristocrats , mexican families , canadian traders , chinese sailors , indian tribes lived area before gold rush began - everyone got action . this cultural meeting place brought interactions both peaceful ( lessons how use chopsticks ) violent ( practise " frontier justice " usually targeted non-whites without caring whether person hanged anything original crime , if fact original crime took place . ) johnson book sketches believable portrait evolvoing politics region , way explains everything origin chinese landromats antonio bandaras character _the mask zorro_ ( suddenly much more interesting movie since i read this book ) . johnson writing gender-studies perspective , so she particularly interested issues sprung up ( mostly ) all-male mining society . if you're culture considers women work " unmanly , " thus never taught cook or clean yourself , how you survive frontier environment ? some , answer you didn't ( miners got sick lot , scurvy one killers ) . others you either learned practise domestic chores yourself ( which you could then sell or split others ) , and/or you paid lot money help . other words , gold rush not only attracted men after gold , but women who saw they could make money selling services ( all kinds ) gold miners . johnson section french prostitutes , example ( who going get taxed inspected veneral disease if they stayed france ) , explains how real money-makers gold rush often not miners ( who depended luck strike it rich ) but merchants who sold them . thing i admired most this book author voice . johnson presents us bunch stories , but instead offering just one interpretation , she gives us many possible readings stories also reminds us whose voice left out . example , her section miners diaries she reminds reader diary-writing important part 19 protestantism , so most available diaries written very religious , protestant perspective . older historical approach would claimed this meant most people camp religious protestants : johnson , other hand , reminds us catholics , non-religious protestants illiterates there too , but they weren't writing diaries . overall , i thought johnson book very impressive . it won't necessarily give you complete picture gold rush ( johnson only looking southern mines ) , but it give you more complete picture than you'd if all you'd ever heard hollywood version history . looking some other reviews this site , i gather some people get mad this book because it doesn't squish history into adventure story , while others get mad because they see it " liberal revisionism . " i actually thought johnson really fair her presentation history : she spends lot time looking raiding fights going * all * racial groups this area , she makes it clear fact american miners came dominate mines lot fact mines usa , government tended ( but not always ) side natives over foreigners . revisionist angle , yes , johnson challenging popular perception what gold rush ( all-american bonanza ) but she doing so based what seems lot historical evidence testimony miners themselves . other words i'm gathering most people who hated this book looking something completely different than what i would look history book . if you , like me , looking well-written interpretation historical evidence acknowledges when author * doesn't * know something , this good history book .	1

while watching " jeopardy " his new york apartment , howard mitla hears sound finger tap-tap-tapping his bathroom sink . it coming drain ? why doesn't his wife notice anything wrong ? this job drano or pair hedge-clippers ? mitla situation only mean one thing : we world stephen king imagination . this 1994 collection king shorter works his most diverse ever , while some , like above story , " moving finger , " deliver king typically creepy chills , there also sherlock holmes mystery , poem , journalistic account his son little league team , even religious parable . not everything terrific , but nearly everything works least little , several approach level king best writing . my favorite " dedication , " very unsettling story woman devotion her son literary success shows both king gutsy gross-out artist weaver gripping yarns . even if it isn't exactly frightening , it truly unnerving vein " shining " " dead zone " one king best-ever endings , both clever sympathetic . speaking " dead zone , " obnoxious supermarket tabloid reporter book , richard dees , back job chasing vampire who flies aid cessna skymaster , knocking off staffs backwater airports " night flier , " king tale classic macabre mold . my favorite these spookier stories " chattery teeth , " closest thing " evil dead 2 " short-story form . king often tries funny his writing , but he seldom successful it he here . couple stories ( " it grows you " , " sneakers " ) begin well before petering out . others , like " umney last case " " dolan cadillac , " take too long get started but reward patient reader , least somewhat . i can't think but one or two stories here utterly lame , except maybe " my pretty pony , " story aging , " you know they got hell band " which telegraphs its punches mile away . but others good reads , even little league article , " head down , " which manages something more than product indulgent father who happens talented writer . there neat elmore leonard pastiche , " fifth quarter , " apparent nods h.p. lovecraft ( " crouch end " ) , roald dahl ( " house maple street " ) raymond chandler ( " umney last case " ) . best these ray bradbury-like story called " suffer little children " schoolteacher who doles out more than detentions her young charges . i thought sherlock holmes story , " doctor case , " nice try , though i can't picture watson holmes discoursing " ponces " way they here . some readers may find this less satisfying than other king short-story collections , particularly his first , " night shift . " but " night shift " couple clunkers , too , if " nightmares dreamscapes " fails times , it so sake king advancing his craft . if you find stories like " ten o'clock people " " rainy season " anything less than classic king shorts like " mangler " " quitters , inc ., " you kidding yourself more than little bit	1

i couldn't even begin count all things stanley coren gets wrong intelligence dogs . instance , one section he claims dogs ability math but part book he claims they can't tell difference tug toy human skin . first clearly way beyond dog capacity , while second something which comes totally natural them . how coren get things so backwards ? " intelligence " tests he provides nothing intelligence but how focused or driven dog test ( or game ) while you're doing it . instance , i tried one tests my dog putting piece food under towel , then waited see how long it took him find treat . i'd still waiting if i hadn't decided he'd never look under towel . then i tried same game teasing my dog one his favorite toys . then i hid it under towel , it took him less than second get toy . so my dog apparently both smarter dumber ends coren intelligence spectrum . ( this just one example , way : whole idea testing dog iq like this bogus . ) don't get me started coren pedantic retelling alpha myth . granted , he wrote this book before latest research wild wolf packs proved there no such thing dominance hierarchy , or alpha wolf , or rest alpha nonsense . though , i doubt if even data would change coren mind . after all , he seriously recommends rolling your dog over its back every day pulling one animal hind legs air create posture which supposedly " signifies submission pack leader . " ( really ? dogs use " signifiers " now ? )the funny thing , shortly after reading passage i saw wolf documentary tv papa wolf exact opposite or what coren recommends ! he rolled over his back let pups jump top him bite his nose ! they loved it ! so i tried what papa wolf his pups my dog -- alpha male , if there ever one -- he loved it . later night , our last walk , he ten times obedient me than he before i'd mimicked papa wolf behavior . again , coren everything exactly backwards reality . this " through looking glass " quality persists throughout book , coren even saying dogs capable hypothetical , symbolic , conceptual thinking . wha ..? i'm sorry . i love dogs i think they wonderful abilities should honored respected , but abilities they geared dog , not mini-me four legs tail . one thing , fully one third dog brain devoted processing olfactory information , none processing symbols concepts . i think coren needs little more research comparative neuroanatomy actual wolf behavior before he makes more ridiculous claims like ones he made this inane book .	-1

donald davis , his book lightning strike , made effort clarify historical record providing details demonstrate , once all , who responsible shooting down bomber carried admiral isoroku yamamoto over bougainville april 1943 . much book focuses events leading up mission find shoot down yamamoto aircraft . this first portion book introduces members strike team responsible intercepting destroying targe t.t om lanphier , one pilots mission , claimed he solely responsible shooting down aircraft carrying yamamoto , but davis brings forth new evidence not available contemporary historians immediately following war demonstrating lanphier not only not shoot down yamamoto plane himself , but probably no involvement whatsoever shooting down aircraf t.t he book easy read certainly provide new insights into 60+ year old controversy over who responsible ending yamamoto involvement world war ii . i would change only couple things book - first very minor : conclusion book , davis tells us rex . barber responsible destruction yamamoto bomber , but then he ends book writing " 2004 ... rex barber deserved 100 percent credit shooting down admiral yamamoto . resolution accompanied legislation clear path congress finally award barber medal honor . " unfortunately , he not tell reader whether or not deserved medal ever awarded ( it turns out , legislation still pending publication date book ) . 2nd thing i would change little more significant - i would changed length book removing some pre-mission background information members strike team . details presented make interesting reading , but ( my opinion ) , don't really add understanding mission itself . i would strongly recommend this book anyone looking understanding what happened admiral yamamoto fateful day	1

what zionism why must it critiqued . this book addressing latter , but we must address both . zionism nationaist idea coming late 19th century . it nationalist religious secular(one many ironies ) embraces jewish people quest nation . we must view it we view pan-turkism . pan-tukism views turks people , but turks also muslim , thus it encompasses religion nation . jews basically same , nation wrapped inside religion , like all old tribal religions used like hindu nationalism today , we might japan . zionism socialist . it looked land , originally uganda , then israel , which shoes just how unreligious it originally , since it didnt see israel essential . israel suprisingly well like most national movements it envisioned ' greater ' version homeland , like ' greater ' greece or ' greater ' serbia , or ukraine . critique it doenst clean hands . most ideologies dont . ideology its affects not two same . communism isnt inherently evil , but it responsible evil . however contemporary critique zionism decidedly left wing communist view nation doesnt matter . but then communism died so zionism . zionism its ideals died long ago . so why this book trying put new spin it ? most likely what we seeing here appeasment international media , neo-nazi islamist obsession ' zionists ' . however zionists dont exist . it red herring , like those who used find communist conspiracies everywhere . this book outdated lacks percpective . seth . frantzma	-1

written late 1990s ( later updated ) , tom friedman lengthy assessment globalization post-cold war ear etchd its place one more prominent optimistic takes subjec t.t he ny times columnist main thesis cold war system politcs ( where governments largely determine course action ) given place globalization ( where governments open up free-market capitalism allw open reporting communication ) . friedman spends more time focusing benefits globalization -- mainly , easy access cheap world labor provides poorer countreis access successful jobs , allowing them improve ( lexus ) . meanwhile , goods manufactured more cheaply , saving us money . also , free open reporting helps lead governments more towards democracy discourages corruption . thirdly , countries who interact economically disincentive get into military conflicts each other . much made globalization negatives , which friedman not ignore . this threat our sense community ( olive tree ) which we fight feel part . globalization , this local identity risk , especially smaller countries which feel they becoming " americanized . " while book long , tlatot success relies friedman great storytelling his ability encapsulate complex issues into short catch phrases ( such electronic herd golden straitjacket ) . there several problems this book , most significant which this -- people don't want like globalization . they would much rather view it ominous , spooky power which anyone sufficient intellect should dread . whether it couched environmental destruction , corporate hegemony , american imperialism , third-world exploitation , people love hate it , friedman unable properly combat this inertia . it also significant after last several years note areas where friedman predictions turned out incorrect . while internet communications revolution changed anglosphere , it not spurred much democratic change china . friedman comments enron worth good laugh well . while some aspects friedman analysis super-empowered individual threat seems prescient regard 9/11 , there aspects book which ring hollow post-9/11 world . friedman offers possible solutions problems which globalization might present , some which contain some political bias ( i'm still not exactly clear how stricter gun control laws lead better economy , instance ) . though i not read world flat , i surmise this friedman answer obselete elements this book . despite these issues , most readers find this book among most interesting those subject . while you may not always agree him , you enjoy friedman stories analysis future	1

" although i think it somewhat unfair refer woodward either right wing or hack . i'm afraid he much closer these two appellations than he myth created around him . sooner people realize this , better it all us . real bob woodward veiled too long his mythic aura . it time this veil lifted all us see real woodward . i think bob woodwards world , real mythic , quite instructive . time passes , i hope fictional woodward continue inspire young reporters tilt windmills ... i hope real bob woodward story helps us realize both valor value fleeting you stop champion once you've joined mill	-1

william shakespeare play " much ado nothing " extremely funny piece literature . i thought it very cleverly planned out humorously executed . dogberry his men constantly mixing up words their meanings it gave readers comic relief . deceit mistaken identities added so much humor already capturing story . i believe shakespeare main point writing this play show many times , people get worked up over simple miscommunications . you mishear something wrong , or your anger , you tune out someone before getting all facts . all we would need fix certain problem would going source information , but many times we take easy way out . we jump gun little choose believe whatever told us despite our gut feeling information wrong . example this would when leonato heard hero scandalous evening borachio . despite fact she his daughter he would know her better than anyone , leonato believes lies told hero . leonato , her father one who raised her , should known his daughter well enough know she would not dishonor her fiancï¿½ herself . especially night before wedding she waiting . instead choosing believe his daughter , who firmly denies any all sexual relationships , he joins claudio , don john , don pedro disgracing her . one lesson learned " much ado nothing " never should people automatically assume something correct . we should " take everything grain salt " - test everything . people world these days so willing lie us readily so without second thought . many times people lied without even knowing someone so . true , sometimes lying deceit all good fun , but it still possibility hurting someone . even innocent lying its consequences . benedick beatrice both believed almost immediately what they overheard their friends saying garden correct completely true . neither person decided test what they heard . see if what said true . because both not check see if information they heard correct , everything worked out . both assumed what they heard true acted it . there no visible consequences . what mess you would if benedick decided what he overheard could not possibly true . beatrice would made fool out herself while thinking benedick felt same way . same could said other way around . i would recommend this play other readers . if people don't like read , then i would not tell others it . combination not liking read difficulty understanding old english would not make very fun pleasurable read . many would miss out humor cleverness shakespeare brilliantly displayed his audience . readers other hand would most likely like this play . humor lightheartedness makes it enjoyable play . i found myself constantly wanting know what would happen next how it would end- how shakespeare would wrap it up . happy ending also nice touch . yes , old english adds challenge reading . sometimes hard understand language makes you stop think what shakespeare trying say ultimately makes you stop realize what he truly trying communicate his audience .	1

author lovell clearly wants refurbish isabel burton image , she so . doing so , lovell not appear let desire attain goal outrun evidence hand . indeed , lovell provides reader considerable body previously unknown and/or unused material which supports her contention isabel burton --- long branded some sort religion-filled -frenzied lunatic --- piece many other victorian women who actually helped their husband careers immeasurably . ( consider , example , elizabeth custer , wife george armstrong custer . ) this book not end-all-be-all those interested richard burton , however , there actually very little way detail his travels experiences . this makes sense when narrative hits areas burton himself purposely left blank ( his indian years , forinstance ) . but this approach makes problems areas burton purposely highlighted . i enjoyed book book , found lovell stylish writer who alerts her readers her own biases ( always welcome historian ) . but those who read burton before this could --- stress " could " --- oddly unsatisfying piece work . those who come subject fresh , or wish round out their understandings this intriguing couple ( hence " could " caveat above ) , this wonderful book . it , after all , not all richard ( although richard might've thought so ; yet even here , lovell makes him good deal more rounded his sensibilities sensitivities than many who've earlier given him go ) . book couple , within those parameters it solid fascinating volume	1

most important subject homeschoolers --- teaching beginning reading -- moores give poor advice . read page 107 . they advise you wary " intensive " phonics but they don't define intensive phonics . they say young children who problems reading usually " just not ready . " my experience most such children simply not effective phonics . book advice : if you weak background phonics go out get book or program . idea repeated prevous books many bright children devise systems phonics other attack skills largely themselves . but bright child might got into useful reading much sooner he gently introduced phonics . what if you wait wait your bright child never figure out complexity word decoding . because early years so important language acquistion , starting phonics two or three years later could limit child future potential cause parents ( child ) much needless heartache stress . don't , moore recommend , delay wait light " click . " when child name letters alphabet gently start teaching systematic phonics . bright students move forward quickly , slow ones move slowly but none should experience failure if taught patient parents . page 105 he suggests " watching opportunities " teach . teaching sound o oats . most experts would say teach sound oa oats . book condemns " zealots " who rush little children into formal reading . it says development principles opposing this unchangeable rock gibraltar . ok , i don't want " rush " my child . my child wants read . tell me how it gently !! this reviewer concerned only chapter three this book	-1
before you start this book you should know any resemblance book movies hollywood turned out completely accidental . names main characters only similarity i could find norm , book much better . this , last installment musketeer series , gives us story final acts our heroes , athos , porthos , aramis d'artagnan . unlike many literary characters our musketeer friends aged story progresses all retired but d'artagnan who still captain king musketeers . athos porthos quite wealthy aramis attained rank bishop . aramis not content his station however knows secret he thinks he use become pope . this secret knowledge louis xiv twin brother who hidden away bastille aramis quite sure this brother would make better king than current monarch . aramis also pretty sure new king gratitude nominate his liberator office cardinal then scheme make new cardinal pope . this plot aramis acts alone except some help porthos who no idea what he involved . twins successfully switched short while but then plot falls apart aramis porthos flee their lives although porthos still not sure what going . " pretender " throne left his own devices aramis imprisoned new location iron mask added his discomfiture . aramis not come across this book much hero many respects this story much darker than it predecessors . given advanced age musketeers , there not nearly many swashbuckling adventures one accustomed but occasion porthos particular rise challenge . political intrigues court louis xiv decline musketeers fact main plot lines this story . end , only one four left find out which one you just read book . athos , way , only seems play side role this story neither involved plot against king or his rescue . always case , dumas ' writing style superb filled historical fact . he tend bit wordy his books often much longer than necessary but even this slight drawback he ranks one my all-time favorite authors . this book dumas closes out careers his most popular characters he it style	1

i think it good idea question some actions our present administration . but i also think it good idea use facts logic so . even lying counterproductive administration look good when attacks it illogical , irrational , false . election 2000 florida stolen ? course . bush gotten all gore votes gore gotten all bush votes , bush would won very easily . but when gore one who got most votes florida , he lost . there legislature supreme court made sure ! still , i think it little good mention this unless one wants honest other issues well . gandhi good person discuss book mentions israel ? maybe so ! after all , gandhi recommended jews try non-violence against germans late 1930s . idea not work . it just bad guess ? maybe . but gandhi also vicious opponent jewish rights levant . he no hero far i am concerned . i'd like moral person , means i wouldn't want like gandhi ! i think it may good idea modify some truly counterproductive colonial boundaries some middle eastern nations . but bronner totally unconvincing making his case , given his terrible biases against human rights middle east . let see , he says " worry over treatment arabs jews stretches back last century " ( i think he means nineteenth , not twentieth ) . arabs jews ? um , i suppose one could say worry over treatment germans , poles , russians , others jews stretches back century more . worry over treatment white americans blacks stretches back before civil war . but sentence makes whole book suspect : he appears attacking human rights vengeance . author says there " ethnic cleansing " creating israel , " employing rape torture turning those arabs living new state into second-class citizens . " he implying jews villains arabs victims . but that not true . once again , same sort thing could said , again untruthfully , behavior jews during world war two . once again , this sort statement simply vicious attack human rights well truth . bronner also attacks ariel sharon visiting temple mount ( holiest jewish site , which happens jerusalem , which happens capital israel ) . plenty knesset members visiting temple mount . why not ? but bronner makes it look if sharon something wrong visit it . he calls it " publicity stunt , " without explaining if israel tried prevent him going there , would rather serious attack jewish rights nation israel . israel , after hit series suicide bombings originating jenin , finally took some rather heroic action . it sent some ground troops jenin . this litmus test me . bronner least praise this ? no , he mocks it ! author ideas land awfully arbitrary . he shows maps indicate , falsely , israel expanding . that preposterous . 1968 , israel included all sinai . it gave all land , several times larger than rest israel , egypt . but bronner only shows tiny israel 1948 claims israel now bigger than ! bronner applaud " geneva initiative " way achieve peace region , but i think he way off base here well . author blasts authors such christopher hitchens paul berman simply speaking truth times when george bush might agreed them . he really think it ought obligation us lie just so we'll disagree george bush ? i would think truly terrible idea would simply make bush look good make us look bad . bronner asks us , rhetorically , what wrong noam chomsky . well , i'll tell you what wrong him . sure , chomsky bright sometimes makes some good points . but number issues , he simply dishonest , he uses dishonesty support those who attack human rights . this book not lead us , um , true path .	-1

i've read all previous reviews amazon this book , i surprised find what i consider major message this book overlooked all reviews . first all , let me say i found this excellent , elegant exposition just what title indicates - " heart islam . " professor nasr explains better any other writer i ever read just what things like love justice mean muslim inner life . one hand , he addressing post 9/11 world , attempting nurture sense balance what terrorist attacks meant , mainstream muslim perspective . believers religions not always live up ideals expressed their faith nothing new , professor nasr certainly isn't trying deny . but major point - one suggested subtitle " enduring values humanity " , one taken more serious demeanor since 9/11 - professor nasr attempt show islam , society , sees itself threatened secularism globalism , which basically western creations which western society assumed , without any really good reason , universal application , which western governments , beginning imperialist period up present , foisted middle east , theoretically its own good . he points out , many major ills muslim societies , such oppressive regimes , result western tampering their societies over last two hundred years ; if one doubts this possible , one only look other areas globe , such central america , realize this not only possible , but almost unavoidable , long major industrialized powers insist setting moral tone world - moral tone predicated maintaining control other areas world , mostly premise economic necessity . professor nasr writer tradition major esotericists twentieth century , most notably rene guenon frithjof schuon among others , whose major warning us world become more secularized , true belief god jeopardized result ; secularism creates world which god marginalized , primarily basis belief inspires tyrrany . globalism further creates world which there no real place people base their lives belief god , because economic necessity becomes only constant life . final analysis , i believe this major argument this book ; 9/11 simply provided reason making argument , time goes this argument seems make more more sense , america sinks into its third year trying create middle east its desired secularized , globalized image . you may not agree this premise ( although i ); worst part all most westerners don't understand argument all	1

yoda one most important beloved characters star wars universe , yet most books comics relegate him background role . book titled yoda : dark rendezvous , one would expect see lot yoda action . good news sean stewart truly delivers . while yoda not featured constantly throughout book , when he appear his characterization simply flawless terrifically well . stewart captures all varied sides yoda we first glimpsed empire strikes back masterfully depicts why this 900-year-old jedi held such lofty regard why he so near dear our hearts fans . count dooku extended offer yoda meet person dark side-drenched planet vjun possibly discuss way end clone wars . yoda knows this probably trap , but goes anyway . he cannot extinguish hope his heart his fallen student one day see light return jedi temple try set things right . two new jedi introduced , maks leem jai maruk , their padawans whie scout . stewart builds these new characters skillfully quickly , so time they get into situation they may not all escape mid-book , there true emotion invested story . i very much liked how scout whie embodied two different kinds potential jedi . scout work like mad constantly make mistakes get anywhere order , while whie strong force effortlessly glides through training temple . however , scout experience scrapping her way through life serves her well once they outside tidy confines their home coruscant . asajj ventress displays truly vicious streak her nature . her actions during spaceport fight mid-book deplorable , yet her animal charisma still comes through her interactions dooku . her conversation dooku concerning his ultimate role schemes darth sidious fascinating ; it this sort insight , which fills out what only sketched films , one primary reasons i enjoy reading star wars novels so much ( even if my personal views sometimes differ ) . stewart lets us rattle around dooku head several occasions , what we find there fully realized , powerful man who knows he may very well wrong path but who can't bring himself step off . book quite funny star wars novel . stewart not afraid drop humor even most dire situations , while i enjoyed vast majority it , points it almost became too much . overall , though , it welcome aspect most it worked fine . it certainly helped distinguish good guys bad , dooku , ventress , traitor tac-spec footman droid kept serious . i also gleaned stewart must birder ( one myself ) his references zeiss , his specific mentions birds several times vjun coruscant , most definitively his citing peterson guide droids republic , vol . vii ( peterson birds guides arguably most classic successful line modern birding books ) . i found climax book bit lacking suspense department , dooku ventress essentially just run away we know films dooku yoda not going come terms war before revenge sith . climax satisfying psychologically but story not really end much changed big picture . i mentioned above , it stewart characterization yoda this book truly shines . we learn many details , such yoda adoration disgusting food , how he handles training youngest padawans , how he feels count dooku war , what sort r2 unit he would make . conversation dooku yoda climax terrifically interesting , image yoda standing count window ledge pouring rain tapping window grinning like gargoyle one i'll take me this book long time . yoda depicted true master inarguable spiritual center order , but same time he not portrayed perfect . it clear he learned so much making centuries mistakes . yoda : dark rendezvous delightful , fast-paced read , taking more chances tone than typical star wars novel really paid off . this sean stewart only star wars novel date ; i hope del rey plans work him again future .	1

kaminsky written easy-reading , far-ranging account his travels thoughts pork . book divided into short chapters , grouped roughly topic , interspersed recipes . recipes range fairly straightforward extremely complex . i havent tried any them , but they sound delicious . kaminsky starts book focused ham , specifically spanish iberian ham , goes into some detail food science studies curing process . it all remains fairly non-techincal , consisting mainly quotes experts , but scientific study welcome addition normal food/travel writing . he also discusses spanish conquest americas , how their introduction swine changed way we eat today . he uses this segue talk american barbeque , then he delves deeper into american pigs , looking factory farms dominate pork production us . section factory farming important one , it certainly deserves its own in-depth book ( perhaps social governmental intervention , depending your point view . ) overall , this engaging book . there some minor faults , though . i felt narrative structure could little more tightly focused ; kaminsky covers lot topics , sometimes i felt there little tying everything together . section " pork taboo " seemed particularly underdevolped . it felt times like it might series long magazine articles , rather than single book . i also found kaminsky writing style bit pretentious times , when simpler descriptions ( less name-dropping ) would sufficed . overall though , i would recommend this book . it filled eccentric characters , often far-off places , who passionate pigs , which exactly what you want food travel book	1

someone who struggled eating disorders over ten years both severely underweight overweight within space 18 months , i thought this book might some way helpful . some it , but major flaws it also contains ruined my reading it . bovey angry - fair enough , but she lets her anger cloud her vision goes much too far many poorly-researched , aggressive arguments . particular points she tries make anorexia extremely offensive . she narrows her focus see only world which compassion finite apparently selfish anorexic stolen all sympathy owed overweight woman . just simply isn't way things anorexics many ways treated far worse than overweight - force-fed locked isolated rooms without light or conversation until certain weight gained what i remember . but this isn't point , anyhow . it not competition . there no need try prove your own suffering more worthy than someone else . points you make should able stand alone . bovey viewpoint extreme . she no distance what she writing , which make passionate book , but also very black-and-white attitude . surely there space middle ground acceptance , where larger people not vie respect expense others ? truly fair world , one which no one discriminated against because size , i would like think criticizing very thin would also unacceptable . many ways , bovey aggression reaffirms her perceived quot ; outsiderquot ; status allows little room reconciliation	-1

this companion volume care soul presents same intelligent blend jungian psychology neo-christian spirituality . but , whereas care soul stressed psychological psychotherapeutical aspect , this one concentrates spirituality side . neo-christian ( gallicism ) i mean liberal , post-modern christianity , not new age-style gallimaufry . if you read emerson or ever heard unitarian-universalist sermon , you'll know just what implies . there very little moore ideas either supernatural or " magical " . mystery within . infinite or transcendental essentially symbolic ( nevertheless true , one would expect true symbols . ) like emerson , moore interesting , provocative , elegant writer ; , like sage concord , not always notably clear one ! more traditionally-minded mainline christian need not necessarily agree everything moore says . but his epigrammatic style full thought-provoking statements meditation . this useful book , someone said .	1
i'm enjoying this book far more than all other elementary game theory textbooks i've plowed through . i'm doctoral student economics , i'm reading this book readings class . i highly recommend it anyone interested dipping their feet into game theory . it very readable uses no mathematics , thus making it accessible non-technician beginner . brams uses 2x2 , non-cooperative models complete information most part . he uses both game trees normal expressions situations under analysis . this , i think , one strengths book . stories familiar , if you familiar judeo-christian religion , thus this captures one attention ways abstract stories prisoners , husband wives other classic illustrations game theory may not . god included player situations brams analyzes , his interpretations , very least , illuminating . while reading it , i reminded edmund burke quote which more or less says even heresy valuable insofar it stirs stagnant waters science such progress made . i am finding even when i disagree brams interpretation , his game theoretic explanation nonetheless sheds some light story , well broader spiritual ideas like faith rationality . one criticism i book , though , it limited only games complete information . i said , i believe fact this book only uses noncooperative games complete information its strength , precisely because i believe this book helpful primer game theory . but , because he omits problems imperfect information , i am left wondering whether he truly modeled many these situations accurately he could . instance , when dealing " sacrifice game " involving god abraham , wherein god ordered abraham sacrifice his son , isaac , brams seems treat abraham complete foreknowledge god preference rankings four various outcomes . it difficult me believe abraham , even intimate god , would possess this kind knowledge . i would preferred see brams introduce models which would allow abraham deal asymetric information inherent this kind situation . anything lost assuming complete information these games ? not necessarily . not worked alternative problems out myself , i cannot say , but since brams so effective making game theory accessible this book , i believe he ample opportunities book introduce slightly more complicated notions like mixed strategies signaling . he certainly talented creative enough so . all all , i recommend book all students economics , religion , sociology political science . i not necessarily believe analysis hugely valuable more generally " spiritual " person , but i definitely would not discourage person reading book . brams unusually gracious respectful religion , generally , characters ( including god ) this book . definitely plus . it rare anyone assume rationality when thinking religion , when scholars finally , i tend impressed . i impressed brams , both tone book , but also content . highly recommended	1

i liked daniel cohen work since 1996 when i first read his paper " tests `convergence hypothesis ' : some further results " published journal economic growth ( september ) . so , i came current book positive preconception - i am glad say i not disappointed . provocative title book misleading extent it conveys black white message : globalization one side ; its enemies other . not so . central point argument against false notion wealth income disparities west third world resulted either religious differences or exploiter-exploited relationships two regions . book points out what some interpreted result evildoing part west simply impacts unintended consequences technology . book uses example algeria where technology like ddt intended mosquito eradication therefore malaria typhoid elimination indirect effect allowing population growth which needed more food , which needed more land other resources grow food , end resulted inequalities reduced happiness . example makes clear consequences globalization " transcend simple categories good evil " ( pp . 2-3 ) . globalization not monolithic one-time phenomenon ; instead it sequential systematic westernization globe began " discovery " america 15th century , expanded english merchants 18th century , picked up pace to-date . during its early phases globalization brought non-western regions both cures ( e.g. , medicine ) infections ( e.g. smallpox ) , but it not so clear all intentional . what clear globalization dashed expectations many ended up disappointed after voluntarily abandoning their cultures western civilization , they soon discovered , example , " far delivering free entry transparency dreamed economists , socalled information society creates its own barriers , replacing those technology breaks down .

this quick review penguin edition , which contains both classic original novel its sequel . both good reads though quite different . personally , i preferred darker more dramatic sequel ; " zenda " everything just kind works itself out i thought it just tad campy . well , they're light adventure novels set mid-19th century or thereabouts . not sure where exactly fictitious kingdom ruritania supposed , but i would guess neighborhood austria or hungary . novels feature swordplay , gunfights , romance , plenty plot twists ( especially sequel ) . very well penned , written direct style outstanding word choice . both novels , rudolf rassendyl gets himself neck-deep ruritanian politics despite fact he foreigner total stranger people . what enables this he spitting image king , also named rudolf . this remarkable coincidence heart plots both novels . it interesting comparing these novels " count monte cristo " dumas , which i'm now reading . " count " deeper , more descriptive , paced much slower , requires more thought . well , my book , those elements part what it takes make five-star novel . " zenda " " rupert " too light side hit top my scale . but i still enjoyed them recommend them those looking fast-paced yarn set bygone times . i finished this book flight bulgaria month ago just left it seat pocket . i hope someone found it enjoying it now	1

shakespeare comedy , " much ado nothing , " only positive effect its audience when read . his use verbal sarcasm intellectual farce turns circumstances love into exactly what they many times truly : comedy . shakespeare creates situations appear serious characters within script , yet actually humorous audience . because they able observe things characters themselves not privy , audience able witness full absurdity many messes created within plot characters themselves . while evaluating this play , i found it interesting while shakespeare comedies , " midsummer night dream , " demonstrates how it love causes us foolish things , " much ado nothing " shows way people complicate love themselves . each comedy centers theme love , making it comedic entertaining , yet two hold contrasting views . characters ' actions " midsummer night dream " involuntarily controlled their affections , whether they real or perceived , yet actions those found " much ado nothing " what control outcome love created . throughout this story , shakespeare purposes illustrate many foolish things individuals which only complicate love further than it already . many continually deny how they feel , case benedick beatrice , while others , like claudio , quick fall into love just eager fall out again . love fickleness shown when claudio jumps quickly sharp accusations based upon false testimony , again when benedick beatrice fall love due supposed affection other . story also demonstrates how others manipulate affections , negative or positive results . leonato , don john , other miscellaneous characters add complexity show increase havoc comes increase people situation . this play communicated strongly me circumstances not always entirely complicated they appear . just false identities twisted facts create unneeded , yet hilarious , tension throughout story , putting more stress importance issues within my life makes them more they truly . because this , it not always situation problem , but my own distorted view it . claudio assumptions hero promiscuous nature benedick beatrice quick reaction gossip heard each other two images my own tendency take specific circumstances extreme they should never reach . this play therefore not only enjoyable me read ; it brought light one my strengths times becomes my personal downfall , , making me more conscious this fact , allowed me potential correct it sooner . i wholeheartedly recommend this book , especially those enjoy shakespearean theatre well good laugh . it hilarious story how manipulation our own choice action create complicated labyrinth we unable get out , times don't ever want . shakespeare excellent job poking humor into crevices every situation , lightheartedly reminds us end it our own decisions create , or destroy , mangled outcome we receive .	1

harold bloom floats poet novelist short story writer like big bumble bee stopping short spells various flowers . i found his opinions witty , entertaining , sometimes profound . he lists several reasons reading his first chapter then identifies other reasons throughout text . these include : reading healing pleasure ; reading difficult pleasure since it search sublime ; we read because we can't ever know enough people ; we read prepare ourselves change ; strengthen our self learn its authentic interests ; we read quest minds more original than our own . all these reasons resonated me . bloom identifies range talented poets other writers usually covers one work each his favorites . he defines talent prolonged patience seeing what others tend not see . bloom virtual worship william shakespeare pops up almost every essay . bloom asserts shakespeare strenghts comes making no moral judgements this characters but allows reader play make those assessments . bloom considered shakespeare expert intergenerational conflict . he quotes borges who said shakespeare " everyone no one " , meaning his talent allowed him reveal character without leaving any his own finger prints . i liked bloom taxonomy short stories into two camps ; either they narrative cohension based reality such chekov , james , demaupassant , hemingway , nabokov or they unreal fantasies freed narrative format such borges , kafka , or calvino . he illustrates his taxonomy reviewing least one work each author , including wonderful review calvino invisible cities . section book covers his favorite poets including wonderfully popular " ulysses " tennyson , which one my favorites . i really liked his insights into walt whitman emily dickinson . he regards dickinson one most cognitive unique individuals print thus understand her ' difficult pleasure ' . bloom argues jane austen able , like shakespeare , " manifest sympathy all her characters , no matter how detestable , while detaching herself even her favorite . " he builds case " emma " i found convincing even though elizabeth bennett " pride prejudice " not only one my favorite fictional characters , she one my favorite people . bloom praise dicken " great expectations " matched my own high regard this novel . whereas so much dicken characature , " great expectations " character development reached new height estella decision not marry pip remains one most understated character insights english literature . she enigma but this action or lack action she reveals depth character beyond emotional crippled creature miss havisham tried make her . if she reared man-destroying monster , what better way seek her revenge her " maker " than marry chauvanist monster forsake innocent boy who loved her since childhood but whom she knew she would break . many novels briefly reviewed but i especially liked his review nathaniel west " miss lonelyhearts " his superb analysis cormac mccarthy " blood meridian " . judge holden this bloody saga one most amazing characters literature bloom defends this extremely violent novel gusto . longest essay work hamlet , which full fresh insight into this majestic work . bloom covers 57 poems , short stories , plays , novels this 279 page book , thus giving each literary work around 4 5 pages analysis . i found this just enough bloom make his point stimulate my appetite re-read many these wonderful masterpieces	1

there saying among statisticians ( group i identify time time ): " you always draw straight line two points . " loosely translated , this means you should avoid drawing conclusions based fewer than 3 observations . this my third brother cadfael mystery ( i obtained random selection neighbor giveaway bin ) , i feel i now opine more confidently , knowing my recommendations probably not based coincidental selection best author offer . always , author provides us fascinating unparalleled look into life medieval england , particular focus monastery life . this installment , however , less whodunit than others . principal crime committed hundreds miles away cadfael home shrewsbury all he go some second or third-hand accounts some unusual visitors annual pilgrimage honor st. winifred . some ways , mystery solves itself , cadfael simply providing nudge here there bring matter conclusion . those interested 12th century english history , there especially potent dose it here , brewing civil war empress maud king stephen comes head . wading through these details makes this bit more difficult read than usual . one interesting upshot this part story implication it possible political ( if not military ) enemies civil gentlemanly each other . what novel concept ! book also explores nature revenge , ultimate lack fulfillment it . this , too , concept mostly foreign today world . romance again significant feature , always pleasant surprise given setting monastery . this case , however , romance relatively conventional only peripherally related crime . it however , provide useful clues resolving mystery . subplot relates mysterious visitor whose past connected cadfael , resulting surprise revelation end book . cadfael also engages good deal introspection regarding miraculous divine intervention , befitting occasion pilgrimage . summary , this book continues tradition solid storytelling fascinating reading established author brother cadfael series . both novitiates long-time fans series enjoy this book	1

i just finished last book starchild trilogy pohl williamson last week . i thought first book reefs space best . some things i liked reefs space : plan man - super-computer which runs all human affairs . citizens must constantly check-in computer terminals orders ie . before beginning work , after completing each task , before leaving room , after entering room etc . risks - people who performed badly , underachieved , or caught performing unplanned actions or unplanned thoughts . collar - explosive collar worn risks which detonated anytime plan man sees fit . it also explodes automatically if tampered . body bank - if risk continues screw up or underachieve there still one way he contribute society providing body parts transplanting onto or into those citizens who need them order remain useful society . junkman - man built using body parts made look exactly like one donors body bank order take his place so this donor could escape , only person ever so . there some cool scientific stuff too ; jetless drive , hoyle theory , simbiotic relationships . but all mumbo-jumbo means little me . just call me olaf simpleton because it simpler concepts which i found entertaining interesting . one thing left me cold .... one point story someone says they've known several people who sent body bank , but they've never known anyone recieve body part there . nothing else ever mentioned	1

all my readings bias media , none well documented argued mcgowan coloring news . mcgowan , senior fellow conservative manhattan institute , believes media quest ' diversity ' shapes their perspective how present news what stories cover . part argument here , because news organizations want ' correct ' their historically white-male centered coverage , they willing shape stories minority groups however groups see fit . this includes not running pictures accused criminals because it may cause racial backlash ( more recently , protest uc berkeley ) , using quota system make sure least certain amount " people around town " pictures newspaper runs african-american . mcgowan title may bit misleading , potentially bit controversial , if only " coloring " part title . mcgowan not single out media coverage african-americans , showing media also shape their coverage not offend gays , lesbians , more recently , arab-americans . instances these include coverage gay adoption racial profiling . this book not easy read . paperback version only 250-odd pages , but text small there few breaks chapters . i difficulty reading it until i got towards last 100 pages , when stuff mcgowan documents just becomes so jaw-dropping one can't believe it actually true . this includes vermont newspaper story got writer fired without normal process disputing charges taking place because small backlash agitator community . agitator hired newspaper help shape paper coverage black community , when independent source verified original article factually accurate , ended up editor resignation . book reads lot like text book less like partisan attack ( although times mcgowan obviously arguing one point view correct , but still able show why coverage , nonetheless , skewed ) . whereas books like bias spin sisters rely upon first hand experience inner workings media , coloring news all research . unfortunately , mcgowan not provide footnotes ( he provide notes end descriptions what he citing ) , which , unless you take time read notes end , makes it difficult know exactly what coming where . if you member media , you must read this book . if you care media bias , read this book . if you're casual reader , i can't recommend it you . only problems this book textbook-like nature lack inline notes . my rating : 4 out 5 stars .	1

this well written welcome addition seemingly himalayan pile works world biggest unsolved murder case subject still haunts america this day . it fair say fbi never closed case it no surprise then works such this continue appear . so many however poorly written , cover same old ground present largely unsubstantiated theories conspiracy . whilst i disagree personally authors stance oswald could not lone assassin assumption single bullet theory must incorrect , i found much text commission work generally high value . many recent ie , post 2000 publications subject , i would recommend this book good example well written pro conspiracy text . it frustrating though find yet author who fails analyze magic bullet theory open minded fashion - ignoring ground breaking work discovery channels documentary " unsolved history : jfk - beyond magic bullet dvd " including work undertaken team australian medics wound ballistics experts who reconstructed shot meticulously show it indeed possible highly probable all non fatal wounds kennedy governor connally caused same bullet . interesting exercise would compare this earl warren chapter jfk assassination his 1977 memoirs . one would find resolute assurance commission acted honorably all aspects warren himself , this book however contests whilst commission acted benignly its path conclusion there no conspiracy , it failed investigate properly some key aspects case they so we would left much less murky past rather less suspecting general public .	1

" planetary " nice mix traditional comics story-telling more offbeat , challenging fare like works alan moore , neil gaiman , etc . it traditional its various issues involve such comics popular fiction icons like superheroes , godzilla-type monsters , pulp adventure heroes , multiple universes , like . it offbeat because it treats those subjects darker , edgier way than we're used seeing . example , " planetary " posits if there really superheroes , they probably wouldn't white-bread pure typical marvel or dc offering ( indeed , this series ' version fantastic four , seen toward end this volume , shaping up villainous presence series ) . this idea nothing new , course , if you've read alan moore " watchmen " , various dc/vertigo titles , other titles aimed " mature readers " crowd shelves these days . but while " planetary " definitely gets edgy , dark , challenging like those works , it also celebrates popular comic book storytelling giving us enthusiastic action scenes , big set pieces , exciting revelations , etc ., genuinely fun fact many ways it regular ol ' comic book . " planetary " it both ways revels i t.t his initial collection includes first six issues original comics series , short , appetite-whetting " planetary " preview story ran back couple other comics titles just prior this series ' debut . mainstream superhero comics little bland you these days , but you also find edgier , adult fare out there not exciting engaging you like your comics ? give heroic investigators " planetary " shot . i'll bet you won't sorry .	1

grey king 4th book 5 part dark rising series , it , my opinion , best one series . this book builds off first three ( mostly second ) , resumes story stanton ( 2nd 3rd books ) introduces bran davies who becomes leading character this 5th book . susan cooper retains all richness first three book , she once again utilizes her skill writer paint vivid picture battle good evil ( see me review dark rising see my thoughts how she deals this topic ) . this book goes above beyond what brought us first three books series . this book both more mysterious darker than first three . i remember reading this book child getting chills reading it . it not nightmare scary or anything , somehow it scary while you reading it but soon you put book down , so fear . i think it because cooper so skilled writer she makes you fear characters her book , not yourself . also , her character development far surpassed what she 2nd 3rd books him . she somehow made him more complete , giving him sometimes confidence maturity " old one , " , other times , timidity youthfulness child 12 he . you definitely see cooper writing skills developing her series develops . this books where those skills reach their peak , they height only handful fiction authors last century surpassed . overall grade :	1

while most one year chemistry texts cover more or less same principles , order varies , illustrations similar , but they vary most way they explain material . it vocabulary they use develop helps student develop intuitions , understanding , skills authors after . this very well written text useful non-chemistry majors well science students needing introductory course chemistry . i am reading working through this text my 13 year old son . yes , he bright interested science , but text clear enough both us able grasp understand principles each section each chapter presenting us . not only this text focus teaching basic principles chemistry , it also includes historical notes margins , text focuses practical uses chemistry illustrate its principles through practical applications . while other texts also these features , i believe this text quite accessible even those without strong previous grounding science . each chapter begins series bullet points introducing what going discussed short essay . i like marginal notes illustrations well " give it some thought " feature asks student question or two order clarify understanding ensure grasp principles introduced section . like most modern textbooks , there also liberal use color aid presentation guide eye . authors also provide occasional " strategies chemistry " boxes encourage student develop certain kind thought process ways looking principles chemistry . end each chapter section called summary key terms hits highlights each section paragraph or two key terms boldface . then there section called visualizing concepts basic problems illustrations order get student work mentally material learned . section problems series questions each section red numbered questions answers back book . there also series handy tables provided appendices standard charts inside front back covers including periodic table . again , many these features included other texts because there quite bit convergence what taught one year introduction chemistry course . differences way things said more than what covered . i think this excellent very useful text learning basics chemistry why it matters our world	1
i bought this book because i looking some ideas building chicken coop . new raising chickens , i needed something would provide some good , sensible ideas building chicken coop . i really like this book couple reasons : 1 . there several different designs included book covering housing different types various purposes or situations : duck nest boxes , internal nest boxes , broody-bantam-rabbit coop , broody boxes , anti-broody coop ( sin bin ) , trap nest box , show box , bantam ark , 8ft run , two arks , free range feeder , eight-hen house , more . 2 . there appears sufficient detail each plan enable me successful completing projects . some short comings this book include : 1 ) beginner , book not provide lot background which type housing should used particular situation . example , would i better off building fixed coop or movable ( tractor ) coop ? 2 ) plans book hand drawn , it takes some additional effort understand them compared professionally drafted plans . 3 ) there no materials lists or step-by step instructions , so you'll spend some time calculate those things well . it would nice if author included least materials list plans specified . however , i am very pleased this book , because it helped me think housing needs chickens , it provided me lot good construction design ideas/considerations . end day , i'll probably adapt one or more plans this book my own needs build it . i recommend this book anyone who thinking raising chickens or other poultry , planning build their own housing their birds	1

let me begin saying this book sucked . it sucked so hard , i'm suprised black holes aren't springing up near it . i only finished this book because i bought it thought it would wrong me not . ( i only actually " read " half it , rest i read skim mode)the writing uninspired i didn't understand heroine . all . she apparently some wealthy new orleans socialite who always dreamt wife mother . but she didn't actually take care her child . or clean her house . or sex her husband ( he affair fellow lawyer tragically killed car accident . ) i no idea what this woman all day . except maybe eat icecream ? there several scenes annoyed me , but i think worse when jonnie ( her name jonquil , which please . ) decided she tired her late husband study dark so she pulls out chair rips down drapes . where she leaves them piled floor until he maid comes into room see what going . jonnie promptly tells maid dispose drapes . jonnie something pressing ? could she not clean up mess she made ? after ; i just sort hated her hoped she hit bus . i didn't much care hero , cameron , either . he seemed very one dimensional like every other romance novel bad boy . he trouble juvenile , yet he really tender sensative . i say through his actions i better feel his compassion concern others . so , i guess that plus . jonnie , i felt like reader always told what think her . you should think jonnie compassionate because she hired nanny david ( dead husband ) wouldn't given her chance . you should think jonnie wants take care her child because she says so ( even though jonnie leaves her daughter alone or nanny most run off cameron . ) i never understood title book either . i still can't figure out what opposite characters , their attraction tepid best . i don't recommend this book , unless you're stranded island alone might go crazy boredom . but even then , i would try coconut sculpture first	-1

this book very interesting . i loved way this book shows how mexicans suffer , struggle work hard get what they need survive . this book good way showing different types experiences family goes through . it gets point where you get so into book you get frightened what could happen family next . you don't know if family going get caught border patrol or if you're going able find job next season . you just don't know if your going able survive only thing you your hands hope faith . there nothing i could hate this book only thing i hated read how bad this family suffered . it hurts see how your own people gets discriminated but , it ok because this family like many other mexicans still succeeded after all things they go trough , like discriminated . other than there nothing dislike this book . i would definitely recommend this book everybody especially people who like this family illegal immigrant this country . i would like anti-immigrant people read this book so they see no matter what they try stop immigrants succeeding immigrants never stop trying no matter what they try stop them . this book great book i am sure this story repeated itself many times other mexican families . i am also sure it keep repeating itself many years , but there always limit day come when mexicans treated same everybody else this country . there many illegal immigrants more successful life than people legal this country , it kills anti-immigrants know this true .	1

bit too much like lonely planet like lp , bit lazy predictable . why , instance , these guides not recommend hotels near jama masjid agra ( where one find shops food abundance , where one but short walk red fort hence short walk access taj where transportation not involve hassles one encounters other parts town) ? you tend find lp rough guide give same recommendations far hotels concerned 6 out ten times ... it not difficult - most indian towns any size array options . i find most frustrating aspects this guide : complete lack maps certain regions ( i found there few maps smaller towns tamil nadu ); inaccuracies maps ( akbar inn agra 1km away point indicated not same street tourist guest house ... gwalior , guide you walking lenghty circles only find hotel you looking stone throw station road not indicated ... bhavnagar circle haphazardly placed map middle labyrinthine bazaar apparently meant serve purpose ); scales occasionally wrong . there also internal contradictions ... time town town indicated 5 hours when one looks travel info town but 7 hours when one looks info town . recently decided lp seriously dropped its standards when it suggested turning left out bus stop chinese town plus 1 million people looking red sign , i am loss decent guide book . maybe footprint or handbook guides way go - i yet try them . what i tend find most useful older lps ( eg those 10 years ago ) ... prices change hotels open close but those guides tend provide more options far hotels concerned maps tended more accurate - some hotels remain where one finds one , one usually finds others	-1
okay , if you any personal integrity whatsoever you've already read mirage chimera , previous tiedemann titles this asimov robot mystery series . they both great reads , but this one ( sfwa member ) i'm giving nebula recommendation . ( i usually don't so-called quot ; sharecropperquot ; novels . ) why ? because this novel goes way beyond mystery/action level previous books , brings background into play very interesting ways . without discussing plot , i'll only say it also brings asimov quot ; universequot ; up date concerns modern sf readers . questions like quot;where nanotech ? quot ; quot ; what ai ? quot ; quot ; what happened spacers ? quot ; dealt , or ominously foreshadowed . most importantly , questions raised existence bogard not swept under rug or reduced mere plot point conveniently tied up later . bogard raises fundamental questions three laws , robotics general , tiedemann faces up them lets them play out . good stuff	1

this book could used editor . i struggled through 200 250 pages ( before notes end ) before giving up . i hoping read inside account how prison unions gained power promote building more prisons , or perhaps in-depth review how politicians manipulated public tough crime . instead , i find hard follow mish-mash various vaguely related topics ( farm worker struggles central valley , problems latin america , etc . ) . although never outright stated , it seems her main conclusion california built all these prisons , then toughened laws fill them , because state wanted develop land rural areas . huh ? could it instead no one else wanted prisons near them , rural locations only place they would accepted , partly because locals more interested prison jobs ? if this conclusion , one would think there would some analysis disproving it wasn't politicians getting tough crime first , overcrowding then driving building prisons rural areas , rather than other way around . other problem writing appears like someone trying sound important , rather than trying explain something . sentence structure difficult follow , too many adjectives , etc . here example page 54 : " pivotal verb ' reproduce ' signifies broad array political , economic , cultural , biological capacities society uses renew itself daily , seasonally , generationally . " also , constant quotes middle text , apparently give air authority missing text itself , distracting . why not use footnotes ? example page 43 : " location defense other high-technology jobs ( soja 1989 ; oliver et al . 1993 ) exacerbated state residential income segregation ( walters 1992 ; mike davis 1990 ; bullard et al . 1994 ) . there few good points buried this book . example , point california politicians got tough crime time when crime already started decline two years . or fact definition crime determines how many criminals there - increasing crime rate doesn't necessarily mean increase crime , it simply reflect change definition what crime ( possession smaller amounts drugs , etc . ) . or determinate sentencing we now partly result prisoners suing treated equally under parole rules , very unintended consequence . i wish book focused aspects like these , written easier follow language .	-1

this book simply amazing . i've read it several times over years no matter what else comes out tops charts , this one just stands best them ! actually , this one may best them . story so simple , so fluid it seems effortless . i think writers probably agonize nearly kill themselves trying write like sheldon ( almost always fail ) . story opens young attorney ( very likable ) who , through bad luck , finds herself dire straits . maybe i feel such rapport her because i'm also young attorney who one time penniless nyc . story then twists turns ( sheldon truly genius when it comes suspense ) through her life she experiences tragedy after tragedy yet manages get back her feet . writing straightforward effective , story incredibly satisfying , pacing perfect . only downside this book you put everything else hold while you read it because you not able put it down ! i also recommend if tomorrow comes rage angels .	1
