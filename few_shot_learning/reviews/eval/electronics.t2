consider receiver before buying delorme . delorme receiver works only their software ( receiver not conform any standard , unlike most other receivers . ) delorme software itself not very accurate . just looking area few blocks surronding my home , i found 3 instances where facility shown located several blocks where it actually - but microsoft no problem locating facilities properly . finally , receiver i , even after device initialized , delorme software sometimes unable find it .

epson r2400 purely photo printer . sure understand this before you buy . so if you planning one printer think this it . . . think again . k3 inks not compatible plain paper any documents you print plain paper horribly color shifted distorted . it took three calls epson replacing icc profile before they would finally admit problem k3 ink compatibility plain paper . all magazines raved black white printing quality . not . least not premium quality photo paper . perhaps some more expensive matt papers . i saw very little improvement over my epson r320 . now if you going use it strictly photo printer then this very nice printer . biggest drawback you not find ink cartridges any major store such staples . stock ink guarantee there not apply items not carried strore . this hint #1 . hint #2 if you run out ink weekend need something monday you sol . only option you order ink online . trust amazon they find deliver . however if some reason your lucky enough large pro photo store near bye they may cartridges . cartridges certainly dont last very long $12-$15 each eight them your burning $100-$125 set . bulk ink tanks coming out but i doubt k3 inks imitated . if you stand ordering everything online only looking great photo printer than this may just ticket you . however $850 i fully expected able print documents pictures plain paper . i haven't happy this printer i plan replace it soon . amazon able locate ship ink only reason its still here .	1

i really tried like via michelin , bought it every intention loving it march 2007 . but i feel compelled tell most you " keep shopping . " i bought it due excellent price , small thin size(compared garmin ) . i thought " how bad it ? " i ordered it it shipped my door , then took off 3400 mile trip it . this because my other gps units other cars , other family members already other trips . i bought this one budget gps , optimistic it new sirf-iii chip . but before long , i hated this unit , all criticms other reviews came back haunt me , i tell you it below . first , please note there few positive reviews this unit .... but you noticed they mostly all people who no experience " other " gps units ? or they didn't spend much time it before they reviewed it ? or they haven't experience gps 4 years .. which like century terms how fast this technology changing ? positive reviewers , if this their first " newer " gps if they comparing it car navigational gps 4 years ago , then yes , it quite bit better . but compared new units like mio 310x or tom tom one ( both which i own ) then viamichelin " horrible " user interface , horrible use roads . tomtom mio , often finish what you typing you , they intuitive programmers polished them . but viamichelin very non intuitive , absolutely dangerous try use fly . sure , we not supposed use them while we drive , this one it truly dangerous even when you learn complicated system . so most time , you pull over work it . but it no fun , even you program it , if you go screen it " loses " it you program history all over . you soon frustrated how many steps this unit takes anything , how " lost " it often gets . i try give you pros : pros : small form factor , decent screen , sirf 3 chip . navteq maps . four hour battery life . good price sirf-3 chip unit . cons : horrible non intuitive software program , clunky , multi step interface make your life horrible if you rush or emergency ... or even if you not hurry . horrible speaker .. volume so poor speaker so poor , you can't hear it any road noise present ... seriously ... turn speaker up all way while driving .. it crackle illegible . i read this review , but honestly didn't believe it until i owned it . third , unlike any gps i've , this one literally tells you " start driving " before it tell you which way go , when you've routed it nearest store , etc . think ! it means sometimes you 50% chance making right choice which way go ... then if you guess wrong , it tells you turn around go other way ! seriously ... one feature should enough make you say " no " most gps least tell you " turn right " where you parked or " turn left " but this one say " start driving " without any direction .... because it can't seem route until you drive onto road . it can't it parking lot ! it already satellite location ... that not it .. it software bugaboo i think built into programming . it makes you " start driving " because it can't find your location or know which way you going .. until you start it routes direction you traveling . bad software design sure . when you go canada , you installed ( sd card ) canadian map .... very inconvenient when you cross border . navteq maps could not find many locations coastal maine . literally , we driving coastal roads it said not exist . i found it very slow recalculating trips when you missed turn ( much slower than my mio 310 which purchasd last year , or tom tom one which purchased this year ) this recalculation problem busy city traffic , caused us miss several critical exits . want find poi run ? forget it . too many steps illogical organization compared other major brands . it often could not find even local walmarts ... one there 20 years . i'm serious . i parked front walmarts it could not find ... very old walmarts . sure , garmin , tomtom mio not list all walmarts , but least they get 4 or 5 out 7 my home town . not so via . several towns maine connecticut , i parked front rows old stores there years . punch local stores difficult use poi list , it can't find any them . also , punch or look stores like nearest walmart .... mio tom tom no problems finding several .. or nearest ones it knew your location . but via , it within certain distance you .. or it not show up existing . so .... you then figure out next town search location , try find store . very , very clunky .... can't tell you how much trouble . it so simple other units , you get spoiled garmin or tomtoms . this one makes it so hard still can't find poi . no gps finds all stores .... there limit poi , course . but it seems via programmers spent their time gathering addresses bank atm not restaurants , shopping , etc . believe me , once you've used it trip , it organized make you believe programmers never actually used gps themselves before . i can't say enough how " difficult " interface .... when you go " back " or " forward " screen , it often loses where it ... you start all over again programming where you going , going through multiple difficult steps . when you lose power , again , you start all over . when i bought it , i read some negative positive reviews thought .... how bad it ? i thought complaining people probably not techie complaining no reason . wrong ! experienced gps users ones know just how clunky bad this software interface compared sleek garmin or tom tom interfaces . example : one trip , my daughter began throw up , we find emergency medical treatment facility .... this clunky interface made it very difficult locate one . when you panicked , you want quickly find nearest hospital . this unit makes you put town , etc . if you further than miles or so ... like when you interstate .... so you literally guessing which town search find hospital . which horrible . i this happen before mio , 3 clicks bam you searched found nearest hospital ... one more click you routed nearest hospital . truly , i am sad not recommend viamichelin . i really recommend you " pass " like some other reviewers suggested . i recommend you buy more rapid , easy use mio great screen , blazing fast sirf 3 calculating chip , loud-clear-speaker . if you tech challenged , buy garmin or tomtom their awesome easy use software interface . but don't buy this bad speakered , horrible interfaced , poorly designed , buggy unit . paper , it looks like killer unit . but reality , it unpolished clunky paper tiger horrible use . finally , there " fun " factor . tomtom one fun . mio fast fun , pleasure use ! even newer garmin fun their simplicity ( i hated screen some old garmins . ) but viamichelin x-930 no fun programmed .... it not pleasure use , although it take you across country . believe me , pleasure low price quickly fade once you start working unhearable speaker , unpolished , unfun , clunky , interface poorly organized features disorganized poi menus . polished quick intuitive menu where garmin tomtom shine . only thing better viamichellin screen sirf-chip ... some older garmin use older satellite gps chip than viamichellin , but new tomtom via use same gps satellite chip , but faster software routines cpu chips . but even use sirf-3 chip via michelin , cannot make up poor software menu design . theoretically , this thing should blazing fast , but it much slower than my tomtom or mio . only thing better this unit than mio , via smaller thinner . maybe navteq maps might slightly better some locals . but other than , mio wins hands down , far faster , better easier use gps my opinion . if you looking software ease , go garmin first , then tom-tom , then mio , via last . if you looking value great unit then go mio 310x , it killer unit it hackable . but if you looking simplicity i programming where you going , go garmin first , then tom-tom . i tried you mr. viamichelin , but you need go " finishing school " like other gps students . you just too unfinished rough	1

my opinion : i own ton panasonic equipment , most recently dvd recorder . i using sony dvd-rs no problems , but , panasonic person , i figured panasonic must better . order save few bucks , i joined panasonic club panasonic website , ordered spindle these same type dvd-rs . i this 9/20/06 . i made several phone calls emails find out where my discs , , believe it or not , nobody panasonic could tell me why they hadn't shipped . then , i promised they ship , but i never got them . after talked into placing duplicate order panasonic rep , i didn't get order either . i finally received one order 10/16/06 . they so poorly packaged holder broken . now , i finally my discs . guess what ? they only 1-8x speed ( sony discs 1-16x speed ) , my thermal label printer wouldn't print them because finish . i assured i could print them thermal printer . i burn couple movies , they worked , but i saw nothing special i report . it gets worse : i logged into my panasonic club account , saw two charges i hadn't made : one $ 10,017 one $915 . i fell off back my chair . this day nobody called me , but i managed get some email responses , i told i would watch my credit card - that just what i need ! you know , sometimes you buy brand think great things how wonderful company it , then one day you some dealings realize how wrong you . i'm going back sony , let me tell you , amazon customer service blows away just every company i've dealt ( sorry preposition ) . i should bought amazon .	1

amazon great shipping this product , but i eventually returned it due several problems . they also great return -- they paid return shipping i got full refund . i never tried any recordings this card using media center software part windows mce . i using it snapstream beyondtv 4.1 . if you record using anything but best ( dvd 720x480 ) quality level it would crop out part picture . this known issue apparently driver issue . latest hauppauge driver not solve problem . other problem i several times when i recording two programs same time , one recordings nothing but static audio portion it . i don't know if this problem card or beyondtv , but i think it probably due card . i don't know if i defective card or if this just problem all these cards . i also not impressed overall quality video this card captured . i hauppauge 250 350 cards couple other pcs , video quality they capture noticeably better than captured 500 card . after reading some reviews , it sounds like this case 150 card also ( 500 card basically just two 150s placed one card ) . beyondtv works great 250 350 cards none issues noted above ; but i also only one tuner card pcs i use these cards , so i can't comment how well they would work dual tuner setup using beyondtv . i returned 500 card , i instead purchased two visiontek xtasy theater 550 pro cards . thus far i'm not any issues them beyondtv i hauppauge 500 card -- i record lower quality level no cropping , i've no audio issues so far . quality video also far superior captured 500 card ( although maybe not good captured hauppauge 250 350 cards ) .	1

i purchased md781 + md71 expansion phone after briefly its predecessor md681 . i really like md681 but i could never locate one its expansion handsets ( everyone online/offline constantly out stock ) . overall i'm disappointed this new model after two weeks use i am already looking phone . handheld phones : i like them more than any other phone i've tried . unlike most phones these days they're big very solid feel them ... it just easier hold onto phone like this longer conversation . buttons nice size easy use . hands free/speak phone handheld works well . one person handheld line sound pretty good , but two people handsets you get significant background noise so bad it hurts your ear it hard hear person other end conversation . shared phonebook terrific idea but it could better . it few clicks slow access ... almost quick old rolodex hand ... or copy number local units phonebook ... which defeats purpose . answer machine : once you play messages you no longer visible indicator how many messages , if any , system ( it just me or poor design ) , so if you listen messages when you partner isn't around you need leave note them check messages . quality voice messages bit grainy . i also like how handset docked older m681 ; it laid base so you option wall mounting base ... md781 sits up base like some sort obelisk .	1

you may well pitch instructions because they're worthless ( only reason i'm not giving 5-star rating ads tech video xpress ) . i ready pitch product well , after losing two evenings trying figure out how get it work . ultimately , i gave up relying solely program it came , i instead opted try it my windows movie maker . yahoo ! perseverance paid off ! once i switched movie maker , this tool worked great ! date , i've converted dozen videos content computer files i able burn dvds . i just leave my xpress hooked up back my television so i don't try remember later how hook it up again . doing , i connect my laptop xpress start video converting process within 3-4 minutes . my movie maker program takes over entire process . ads tech video xpress especially useful me because i teach college telecourse often show edited video clips my students . before purchasing xpress , i crudely edited videos i reluctant use ; my videos lots amateur stop/start points . using movie maker xpress , i able download these videos my laptop , then easily edit them so transitions stop start points became smooth seamless . pretty cool . i'm glad i took chance this product ! below hook-up program instructions i've written myself easy reference later . hopefully they'll more help you than instructions come this product : first , hook up video xpress equipment follows : 1 . s-cable ( buy one , since it doesn't come videoxpress ) goes back your television videoxpress . 2 . use red/white/yellow cords running into back vcr/dvd hooked up your televion follows : - all three plug into " video out " column- all three plug into videoxpress tool other end . 3 . usb plug videoxpress tool plugs into back computer . next , open instant video xpress program verify settings follows : - " ntsc " video standard setting- " 640 480 " " 60 fps ( vga ) " video format- " dvd , vcr , tv " video source- " video composite " video inputunder program advanced settings : - low motion ( tv , vcd , dvd)- cpu support : " sse3 " - stereo system : " mts " - video decoder : " video standard : ntsc_m " under properties within program advanced settings : - stream format : video format : " ntsc_m " - frame rate : " 59.940 " - color space/compression : " yuy2 " - outputs size : " 640x480 " finally , close instant video xpress program .

this perfect little tv/dvd little girl room ! picture great hello kitty pops screen certain commands ( volume , channel change .. ) . my daughter age 4 loves it . i would given this product 5 stars but there couple drawbacks ... remote control so many buttons they very tiny , very close together . i barely read what each button because labels/print also very tiny . this annoying when my daughter darkened room i turn bright light just find pause button ... other thing i point out bugs me you can't eject/or open dvd player unless tv dvd mode . other words when i go put dvd , i can't just push " open " . nothing happen . you find right button , choose " dvd " choice 3-4 things , only then tray slide open . all all , these things would not prevent me buying this tv again ... although it would nice if they come out w/ more kid friendly remote bigger buttons/symbols small child recognize ... one great thing i want point ou t--t here fast forward scan you watch it fast forwards ( something not all dvd players offer ) this great when you putting dvd your child they want skip all those pre-movie ads .... you ff right beginning movie !!!	1

i dvd scratched during shipping . one repair kit nothing help it . i considered using skip dr. , but i never cared what it disks . my church media center uses optifix system , so i decided try it , too . scratch gone , dvd plays no problem whatsoever . i'll admit not all scratches repaired this way ; some scratches cannot repaired all . i just know it worked great me	1
i impressed this controller first , found it feel comfortable , work well . it played once while month ( total 10 hours max ) . some time after , next time i went use it , it would only go left game used left joystick . i could not get it center ( or even stay still ) , it would just keep either steering car ( like burnout3 ) or whatever left joystick would game no matter what . i tried it several times , it never worked since . i fire it up once while see if it still doing it , it . i am very dissapointed this , i pretty careful getting this newer version logitech controller . i think i paid $45 locally it , i just bought pelican extreme edge radio shack clearance $19.99 works feels good , but less than half cost . i don't really feel like going thru warranty claim , if it even covered , but it still annoys me every time i look it my xbox ' drawer ' extra stuff . i going go totally wireless ( 4 units ) luckily didn't run out buy 3 more these logitech controllers . i instead bought some extra microsoft controllers , they still one best feeling controllers out there . if pelican holds up , ( model pl-2050 version 2.0 ) i might go get some more if i find them locally .	-1

this system quite sleek , easy fit cluttered living room . assembly takes two minutes . instructions very clear . sound amazing , especially when you put your favorite loud , bass-heavy film . why then i give it one star ? it skips . like nobody business . first , my wife i thought it disks we putting many them scratched . but then we put new disks . no difference . when exactly it skip ? impossible tell . sometimes little . sometimes every frame ! sometimes it'll tell us disks bad . then next time we put them they magically work -- until they skip . so i called philips they said not only would we pay shipping , but they could not guarantee they would fix it , it would take up month before they'd ship it back . save your money ! buy someone else	-1

i've got lite-on dvdrw sohw-1673s burner ( revision js02 ) my fast g4 mac running os tiger burning toast titanium 7 . although my burner nominally 16x-capable , it only burns 6x my setup , probably due slow ( ata 33 ) bus it . i've used number different brands 8x 16x disks , both +r -r , verification failure rate less than 2% -- so few , fact , i often don't bother verifying video dvd anymore when burning tdk or maxell discs .

first all , let my point out mine came demos crimson skies mech assault full version xbox classic arcade . mine new certified microsoft box , etc . maybe they just updated games . anyways , it my opinion better deal buy 12-month pack , but i decided 3-month just because i've got 2-month trial already didn't want 14 months built up . box : there communicator headset , 3-month subscription card , game discs , several manuals connecting xbox live . communicator : purely awesome . i read many people comments saying it breaks little clip . i grant it clip thin could potentially break easily , but it not uber fragile . don't afraid put it . headset weighs next nothing really comfortable . it great outgoing voice quality great sound quality through speaker . xbox live itself : you broadband ? you router switch or hub if needed ? if answers both yes , you need xbox live . it incredible . buy this or 12-month kit if you just starting ( but don't forget start your account first free 2 months . after you live already , renew subscription card	1
i bought blue logger both street atlas 2005 sa2005 hh my dell x50v . no problem blue logger gps but my complaints follows : 1 . delorme not include blue logger manager software hh . now they want sell it separately additional $39 . very weird marketing strategy indeed . 2 . software pocket pc very difficult use , not very intuitive . it seems hand held software developed afterthought software pc . it poorly designed , appeared not fully tested normal users prior releasing market . 3 . it very cumbersome slow determine route . even 620 mhz axim , it slow . worse yet , route often wrong . example , this afternoon i use sa2005 determine route friend house . i followed route , i would come dead end street back track 10 miles get correct route my destination . luckily , i decided use my paper map . later , i tried microsoft mapping internet it actually gave me correct routing . last week location , sa2005 found wrong location given address which would take me 4 miles off . luckily , i knew where it ignored routing sa2005 hh . 4 . many other mapping softwares hh allow one use it 1 hand often finger . but not sa2005 hh . after 2 weeks using it , i found myself going back my old paper map . example , if i not calculated route just simply use gps map travel , software only show street i but no name given no street name shown upcoming cross streets . it not help when you lost . 5 . sa2005 maps seems several years old not very up date . i guess that why delorme not want clearly advertise this issue . i am seriously considering giving up sa2005 consider this my $50 learning mistake , looking microsoft street trip 2005 or later 1q 2005 , iguidance who supposed latest map . i am not alone this several other users also complained delorme user forum . i wish i read forum before buying delorme software . well , live learn .	1

i read all 181 reviews decided half reviewers not get model i . or else they wrote their review too soon . i bought mine june 2006 . it failed before store warranty ran out . one down . replacement lasted month or two before it hung wouldn't boot . two down . sandisk honored their 1 year warranty prompt free rma . one also failed . three down . they replaced it both m230 2gb c150 . c150 hung after 2 weeks . four down . i using m230 two weeks now hope it lasts until c150 replacement arrives . i gotten quite good rma game intend keep playing it either until my warranty runs out or i get one those other people rave . i don't think i'll buy sandisk - unless it free lifetime warranty . i suggest everyone failed m230 exercise thier warranty rights . sandisk needs know true reliability their products .	-1
i purchased one these when new back 2004 . unit worked ok me , main quirk once every hour or two , i go through 3 - 5 minute period bad reception , presumably it shifts one satelite . i unable utilize fm modulator it weak , but went hard wired connection my radio using cable purchased crutchfield . my main issue this unit there newer units available same or slightly more money , which replay options better displays . i would consider those options before purchasing this unit	1

ok - here what you get : 1 power supply brick1 ipod dock1 3-foot cable connect power supply brick dock1 3-foot cable connect dock stereothis version kit compatible 3rd 4th generation ipods ( those dock connector bottom ) ipod mini . although dock connector electronically same all these ipods , dimensions ipod itself differ model . thus , dock comes different plastic tops different sizes ipods you snap right-sized top your ipod ( check size carefully before snapping cover - it goes easily , but it doesn't come off easily ) . cable connects power supply brick dock special apple firewire-to-ipod-dock cable , but cable connects ipod stereo system nothing special , just standard stereo minijack plug one end two rca phono plugs other . you get compatible cable many different vendors many different lengths ; which my case good thing because 3-foot length kit too short . kit good buy ? well , it depends . if you price all components kit separately , you find kit cheaper than individual parts , even if you replace stereo cable i . but , question , you need buy all parts . let assume moment you fact want attach your ipod your stereo consider what you might able without :( 1 ) power supply brick . your ipod dock fact work fine without plugged into power supply . trade-off without it you drain battery ipod while it plugged into your stereo . you get dock stereo cable substantially less than this kit , so if you're ok battery issue , you save money not getting kit . ( 2 ) ipod dock . you plug ipod into stereo without dock . same stereo cable connects dock stero also connect ipod stereo . there two disadvantages this : first , dock gives true line-out , meaning volume control ipod doesn't affect volume coming out dock , so you just use stereo volume control control playback volume . audi o-o ut jack ipod , however , affected ipod volume control , so if you connect it stereo , you careful fact there two volume controls system , which annoying best , there might some risk your stereo if ipod volume too high . it also worth noting if you power supply brick , you not need dock recharge your ipod - brick plug into ipod directly . if you ok audi o-o ut thing ( whether how keep your ipod upright without it ) you save money not getting kit doing without dock . ( 3 ) power-supply brick dock cable . if you don't brick , you don't need cable ; if you brick , you need cable or brick isn't going you any good . if you decided you without recharging ipod while it connected your stereo , you skip brick this cable both . ( 4 ) dock-to-stereo cable . this thing you can't without if you want connect your ipod your stereo , but you lot choices vendors if this all you're getting . even if you aren't getting dock , cable would connect dock stereo same one would connect ipod stereo directly . one more thing consider your ipod might already come one or more these pieces , if you aren't using them elsewhere , you could use them part your stereo set-up just buy any other pieces you need not get whole kit . me , i didn't any extra pieces i wanted works - recharge ipod not worry double volume control , so i got kit . i also got navipod ir remote ( which you get right here amazon ) so i could control it remotely like rest my stereo gear . make your decision , just figure out what you want , what pieces you already , what you might willing live without then make your decision . hope this helpful	1

this card 2 gb ultimate 120x it tested write speed 120 times 150kb/sec which exceeds 18 mb per second . frequently card manufacturers advertise their read speed , which always much faster . analyze your file size pictures you take speed mb/sec tell you how many those pictures you store one second . impacts time pictures . cameras , write speed most important , but speed rating card doesn't necessarily tell you its write speed . music players other devices , read speed may more important . so you might choose different card depending whether you intend use it play music or take pictures . i'm currently shopping sd cards camera capability shoot 3 pictures per second large file sizes . order not slow camera down , i need fast card . i some research realized reviews here aren't necessarily even related this particular card , but all different sizes speeds kingston cards . kingston memory business long time they conservative their ratings . this card #1 my list right now because its tested write speed	1
i bought this memory card my camera sd500 . first , i very dispointed when i only see 1gb my laptop . after googled around , i realized i need update my laptop sd reader driver recognized sd card over 1gb . i'm able see full 2gb after driver update . just make sure you update your device/laptop firmware/driver first	1
i use this conjunction sandisk ultra ii 2.0 gb compact flash card . i like it , but flash card doesn't slide easily . sometimes it get stuck halfway , if unit not designed properly sliders card offer enough give slide card left or right pins . add insult injury , both reader flash card manufactured sandisk . therefore , they should work seamlessly together , but pathetically , they don't . i'd much rather pay more reader worked great , rather than save few dollars reader makes you work every time you use thing . comparison , my camera accepts card perfectly . there no give all , but instead effortless process . not quality reader . other than , it works expected . surprisingly , reader doesn't topple over easily i thought it would . it stands vertically looks like it might fall over when trying slide card . sliding card 2 handed process , so one hand holds unit while other slides it . removing card extremely easy . that one-handed process . " eject " card pc drive then remove it . data transfer card pc very quick . overall , i'm glad it , but it annoyance use it . i hate card getting stuck halfway reader	1
card works great my camera . what more there say	1
i little tentative order itrip lcd because some bad reviews i read . it seems like there very few people sitting fence this item . buyers either love it or hate it . i leaving trip hoped itrip would arrive so i could use it my drive . luck would it , it my mailbox day before i left . i unwrapped it went out vehicle test it . i plugged it into my 20gb ipod photo right off bat thought i trouble . it wouldn't power up , i tried plugging unplugging , cleaning contacts finally last resort , read instructions . after plugging it you play song before it power . this immediately explains why so many poeple complain doas right out box . i set frequency lowest available fm band presto !!! instant music . i don't live extremely populated area so i can't really comment other stations bleeding through but loud passages loud quiet passages quiet . many reviewers complained bad sound quality but you must remember this . it doesn't matter how great quality song your ipod , you playing it over fm radio so it never sound better than fm radio . i inherited my father ' 91 accord work car when he retired it bare bones am/fm radio tone control(bass treble all rolled into one handy knob !!! ) cheap 6 1/2 inch speakers front doors . when i drive i like listen talk radio podcasts occasionally music . sound quality exactly what i expected , no better no worse . i also tested it my wife ' 01 focus . it nice factory 6 speaker cd system sound ipod just fine . bass still thumped highs seemed just tiny bit off but still not bad all . i am completely satisfied product . one strange thing i noticed may explain why some people complain bad sound quality if you tap itrip , sound comes through your speakers much like tapping microphone . if you lay it hard surface your vehicle you could probably hear it through your speakers when encountering rough road . unless there defective batch sent out , i don't know where all complaints come . i got mine $15 private seller amazon consider it great purchase especially amount money . don't hesitate buy one , it works advertised sound quality what it . if you keep these things mind , you won't disappointed	1

best ever , i tell ... my choice 9x12 format decision taken based my traditional arts background , since i make oil paintings traditional lineart drawing concept arts , i use very much wide strokes combination " wrist arm wide motion " . so this tablet well suited this task not too much exagerated size not too small wide movements . 6x8 wacom tablet would more restricted me , but those who like small area usage drawing painting this 9x12 digital adjust so you work it 6x8 , but remember space your desk , it not ' mouse pad ' definitively , get 19 " monitor screen - flat it down table , that almost same space you gonna need . way ... those thinking something different wacom tablets ... don't think ! wacom only one you trust 100% , no doubts , i've tried many ... if you don't know wich wacom suits best you , i suggest you go www.wacom.com , they questionaire there help you out , but it simple : if you pro ... get this intuos3 or better intuos available , that hardcore professional choice , if don't need much pressure sensitivity , make ' lighter ' work , go graphire , if you pro want something work milimetrical accuracy like architecture or technical design get cintiq ( this one top expesive one ) . other application work perfect it too , like 3d software , i use xsi , max , maya , zbrush(this one only wacom please ! ) , modo many other applications composing editing like combustion premiere , it changes way you work better productivity , believe-me . pen tilt great " painter " software , what you maybe would take day finish you seconds literally , wrist sweep tilting pen you create amazing effects one second . also reduce stress your hand arm caused mouse , it improve your life quality not harming you like mouse when you get many our computer . besides it programmable buttons it smart scroll , so you may use you mouse only games after . important point - usb cable huge enough so you work confortably away your monitor screen tablet your lap if wish so . finish : i love my 9x12 wacom , if you buy it you love it too , give it accessories so this babe get happier * lol*a travel bag , replacement tips ( nibs ) kit , sure if you or need ... buy other pen like 6d art pen airbrush so you make extraordinary artworks . hope this helps your choice . best regards ! eduardo . janiszewskicg artist animato	1

most anyone tell you , these speakers excellent sound if you're just going set them up your desktop , then i'd give them 5 stars . however , design wall mounting these horrible you can't ceiling-mount them . logitech not make separate mounts these no " universal speaker mounts " work them . if you want see how they mount , go logitech website , go product support enter wall mounting . some might argue they're computer speakers , not home entertainment center speakers , but $300 , i expect little bit better design	1

this little reader fast easy use usb flash drive . pop your card , plug it , wahlah , all your files shown . transfers very fast easy . it uses standard usb cable , so it likely you could use same cable variety devices ( mp3 player , camera , cell phone)the device somewhat flimsy , however front always snaps off when you try open unit rather than working like hinge , it should . this somewhat annoying reattach hinge everytime , so it gets 4 stars . still very good buy , especially price	1

this product stinks . typically , documentation not written standard english , but some cyber-patois no civilized person understands . their support material exhaustive exhausting solves no user problem . i bought it primarily book reading , so far , not able access single one . quot ; desktop managerquot ; tells me quot ; synchronizationquot ; went ok , but proves false . stories i downloaded nowhere found . i look under franklin reader find nothing . i look under mobi reader find same . i don't need calculator , or memo book , or solitaire game , or voice recorder , or mp3 player , or phone book . i wanted portable library fiction , nonfiction , whatever , this gadget not give it me . if you remember seinfeld episode which foreign professor threw electronic organizer out window , you idea what i feel like doing this thing . i bought it clearance company ebay 50 bucks , so it not huge loss . but i want ebook reader . apparently , there lot ebooks online taking ( or buying ) , but i'll never see them , not franklin ebookman anyway . i'm certainly not going search device . once burned , twice shy	-1

all right , i've wanting share my experience while , so here my story : i interested buying 50-55 inch flat panel tv my living room - nothing smaller . viewing distance tv 10-13 feet . it either going lcd or plasma . i researched market several months , reading reviews , comparing tvs store , etc . i finally took plunge decided this panasonic beauty . i love it don't regret it one bit . if picture quality your top priority , then this tv meet your expectations if not exceed them . colors very natural - it not too bright artificial-looking like some other tvs i saw . i think this advantage plasma over lcds general , i noticed lcd artificial colors effect during my comparisons store . contrast excellent . this actually charasteristic i didn't consider too much , but realized during comparisons how important it . some other plasma lcd tvs poor blacks you could obviously see when you compared panasonic them . i tried tweaking settings other tvs it didn't get any better . you actually see details dark areas panasonic which very important movie watching . watching non-hd programs also quite good . i say quite good because none tvs out there display non-hd content 100% perfectly . but panasonic it better than most . hd programs - incredible ! you actually feel you there . dvds crystal clear well . sports fantastic - no blurring . tv extremely wide viewing angles . trust me , you so much fun watching tv this ! tv speakers more than adequate . i bought surround sound system , but i only turn those when i watch movie or big sporting event . regular watching shows , news , sports , speakers great . finally , i'd like address issue " burn-in . " lot people get scared buying plasma because they're afraid ghost images appearing after static images display screen while . well , i've using this tv four months now - it everyday . i watch shows , sports , movies ( black bars ) , even play video games it . i don't any trace burn-in . course , sensible , don't pause image 24 hours . i read panasonic handles image-burn very well , so this reason buy this tv - especially if you're considering plasma .	1

i purchased hp 8450 year half ago . i see complaints other reviews speed cost ink , but if you send photos off photo lab , not only would it take more time money but quality would not any better . i find print quality good professional lab i used , if not better . i print around 30 50 photos month , mainly sell customers this lot more economical than lab . if you looking wal-mart quality go wal-mart . but if you looking professional quality i not say enough hp 8450 .	1

this set impressive . my husband i somewhat limited size/brands lcd units would fit our family room entertainment center . we like our tv hidden when not use our entertainment center won't accept tv wider than 39 " . last year , perhaps 18 months ago ? we purchased 32 " lcd fit , but we couldn't use our tivo it some reason . we also thought picture looked too small compared our tube flat screen sony . we quickly returned i t.t his month costco coupon book offers this set $300 off savings , so it $999 out door us here oregon . sharp apparently changed exterior dimensions aquos line since we last shopped low behold , we able purchase 37 " instead 32 " . we've ditched our tivo our local cable company dvr w/hd we happy campers . very easy set up two hdmi outlets , one our dvr/cable box one our dvd player . like computer lcd monitors , you tweak your monitor settings , so take time this you won't disappointed . true diehards paying professional calibration but we're happy both digital hd picture quality simple tweaks . sound impressive well . i truly feel like we've got surround sound , without actually home theater set-up . we're very satisfied picture quality , sound quality sharp interface . fact , we returned our local costco warehouse picked up set bedroom .	1

this mouse incredibly difficult use . there actually only one button : whole carapace mouse . so your hand can't really relaxed when you're using it , you continually concentrate order get true right-clicks . order get true right-click , you want grip mouse -- but only place it affords gripping without tending cause false-clicks two little pads right left side . alas , if you grip those ( default mode ) , you get expose , which interrupts your attempt right-click ; if you reflexively follow through click , most time you'll get switched application ( because hey , you just clicked app window expose screen ) . scroll ball nice idea , but it half size it needs order afford decent amount control . without , you get all kinds false directionals ( scrolling right/left when you're trying scroll up/down ) using scroll-ball center-click tricky : often not , even after you configure scroll-ball click " button 3 " , you often not get funky " mouse scrolling " action ( icon appears screen you scroll currently focused document moving mouse pointer -- not crazy idea , but totally counter-productive when what i wanted open clicked link new tab ) . basically , this fussy , fussy device difficult most people use . but since looks so beautiful , they'll blame problems themselves give it high rating anyway .	-1

part my review based fact parts missing when i opened box , manual ( antenna , video cable who knows what else ) , but i able download pdf version manual survived install process . surround sound good compared panasonic sc-ht940 . but when i saw heard onkyo 5.1 hdmi htib w/ single disc dvd hts894 few days after getting samsung , onkyo won hands down . samsung suffers poor manual if these things ( htibs ) intuitive not many connections . i am technical person nothing manual intuitive other than page numbers . i liked tower speakers , but aesthetics aside , sound more important than looks . speaker wire very cheap , but sound still good despite . lack connections hurts samsung well hdmi pass-through . bass good surround sound excellent . but reviewer mentioned out box config bad . cnet tips helped setup . i loved fact it comes changer opposed single disc player . question if you're going spend thousands dollars hdtv , why skimp sound system . overall samsung sound system very good , but i chose upgrade . sound like beauty ear beholder , my ears onkyo system delivers higher highs deeper lows yes it cost more .	1
there three great reasons buy this 5041 . price much lower then other 2 versions . 2 . you need charger 504 usb charging slow inconvenion . 3 . i want use standard usb cables not worry where i put special archos usb cable . i would given it 5 star if adapter act stand also . also it looks like you careful connector , it may break	1
product fantastic ; however , vendor digitechdeals amazon via amazon.com website unsatisfactory . product not new opened despite website description it new product . box not sealed unit not wrapped . it quite obvious box opened . we chose keep product rather than send it back vendor avoid credit card charge no product . so far , so good - however , i unhappy customer due buying experience . recommendation : great gps unit but purchase it off shelf !	1
great picture , easy set up use . 88lbs though , difficult carry upstairs . delivered factory jusy 2 days	1
what say memory when it works ? not much except these also easy physically handle installation . like . shabab ( above ) i too am using these p5w dh deluxe . asus manual it not clear whether this precise model validated asus . nonetheless , my set works flawlessly	1
i recording engineering more than 30 years . i own quite number excellent microphones ranging akg , rode , audio technica more . i helping friend mix song he recorded his digital work station told him how impressed i sound his vocal tracks . he pulled out m-audio nova said microphone he used all vocals . when he told me it around $100.00 new i one . i microphones cost 5 6 times more than this mic but honestly this mic ranks right up there them . don't think cheap mic comes cheap sound , it excellent vocal or acoustic instrument microphone .

can't say enough this gps watch ! it helped me so much my quest my first marathon . there no guessing my mileage . i also recommend 305 heart monitor because monitoring your heartrate very important continuous improvement . i almost purchased 205 i'm glad i went 305 . those you going serious running , you find monitoring your heartrate key improving your running times . i only wish they built monitor into watch instead chest band . other than , i give it huge thumbs up ! great going garmin ! p.s. use motionbased agent sporttracks garmin training center you amazed ! those programs show your route google maps ... just plain awesome	1

we ' bought ' this sytem 4 years ago i've never so thrilled set phones . i've never problem any kind . they clear never interferred any 3-4 baby monitors we've owned over years . they amazing range super battery life . last few years we've added few new handsets convenience . other thing note my 6 , 5 , 3 1 year old not kind they could phones . these things thrown , dropped , pushed off counters , antennas chewed off , submerged water , etc . frequently , they hit tile floor battery cover shoots one way battery shoots other way . someone goes time-out i pop battery back we're good go until gets repeated next day . one hundred times i've expected put battery back not see screen light up , but alas , nothing seems able phase i t.t hey've held up through thick thin . only recently we replace two handsets 5 we've owned 3-4 years . i one sad mom when i'm not able replace handsets any longer they unavailable . knowing how these things hold-up though , they should survive all 4 kids growing up moving out then i won't worry replacement concerns any longer :	1
these cables excelent . they reproduce bass , middle highs very clearly soft way . they sound very good natural . i think guys who problems should checked their equipments , room accoustic speakers before review this product	1

what i purchased guitarport ( hardware device which acts interface your guitar computer ) bundled excellent music recording software program called rifftracker . guitarport plugs into usb port your computer , you plug your electric guitar into guitarport , which enables your guitar many great sounds ; then , rifftracker software enables you professional quality multitrack recording mixing your home computer . read better understand all this . i've owned guitarport over year . it allows you change way your guitar sounds same way word processor allows you choose different fonts . if you want your guitar sound way jimmy page guitar sounds song " heartbreaker " , you change preset which fact , called " heartbreaker " . if you want your sound like john fogerty " rolling river " , you change preset " rollin '" . so . all presets organized genre : metal , blues , classic rock , surf , jazz , etc . they also include preset bass guitar settings , so you use guitarport bass well . it great : you sound like sabbath , cream , ramones , etc . using this device , you avoid expense complexity utilizing hundreds thousands dollars worth effects pedals , and/or expense purchasing several different types guitars ( hollow body guitar vs . solid body guitars ) obtain different sounds . also , you tweak customize presets , give them name your choosing , or start scratch create your own unique sound , you save get back quickly easily . let me tell you , this customization feature actually very comprehensive sophisticated : i've created settings incorporate echo , delay , distortion octaves ( where you add more distortion certain frequencies sound keep other frequencies cleaner ) , where sound you get out your guitar unique amazing ! plus , i've run my electric violin through guitar port , it worked great creating truly memorable audio experience ! much time i plug my headphones into unit , so i play my heart content , without disturbing family . recording , rifftracker software ( which you purchase later after buying implementing guitarport ) , which works quite well , allows non-engineer create complete recordings guitar , bass , vocals drums ( using drumbeats included software ) any number overdubs . rifftracker allows you alter volume level each overdubbed track independent other tracks , so you " mix " your final musical creation exact manner you desire . vocals recorded simply plugging your microphone into guitarport . i e-mail mp3 my recordings my musically interested friends they listen them give me feedback . anyway , guitarport tons fun well worth it affordable cost ! i only give it four stars , because it electronic , computer product , such , it pain set up , drivers install , cables set up just right , etc . i'm sure you've experienced same type trouble setting up new printers or multifunction devices . so i struggle it little bit beginning , but overall , nothing too difficult getting it set up configured . now , here two other excellent noteworthy bonus features you get when you own both guitarport rifftracker software . rifftracker software enables you upload your completed musical compositions website rifftracker users . this website , you listen hundreds songs created other hobbyists using this same recording technique , you leave comments their songs , you read comments left any songs you've uploaded . plus , you read questions answers posted hobbyists using this technology , figuring everything out . this " bulletin board " finally enabled me determine how record vocals guitarport/rifftracker . this website service free . second bonus feature line 6 hundreds pages guitar lessons available conjunction guitarport , plus very clever " guitar-aoke " feature .

product described . i ordered two where buyers typically only order one . he only shipped one , but when i brought it his attention he quickly sent one . no problem just make sure if you order two product you denote it instructions .	1
it what it suppose . what more i say low tech device	1
this card fit well behind battery my razr phone . it allowed me transfer pictures files my computer my razr . adapter worked fine sd card slot	1
i really enjoy dvd-ram format . it seems read lot quicker than -rw/+rw offers easier method erasing all titles start anew . i just wish they would come down price comparative other types discs . their cost makes me think twice before spending money	1

sound quality headphones good price . they don't block noise too well , but what you expect they twenty dollar headphones . great buy	1
love look this case . it pinker than it looks picture , which isn't bad thing me ! i'm stay-at-mom two trust me , cute trendy accessories last thing my mind these days . i'd looking case my rarely used pink ipod , this one it me . i agree lack earbud storage stinks , but that pretty much status quo most cases i looked . they seem made more protection belt attachment while listening music , vs . basic storage when ipod not use . bummer ... but i still love this case !	1
if you want connect your motorola razr phone your computer via usb , this cable you need . i bought similar cable locally three times amazon price , but once i found this one ( before opening other ) , i returned it got this . excellent buy . i rate it 5 stars out 5 . btw , anything your razr via usb ( including just charging phone ) , you need drivers . check motomodders	1
home adapter kit fantastic ! first , it very easy install . second , it doesn't take up much space . third , it increases funtionality skyfi2 . finally , it relatively inexpensive . i received skyfi2 car adapter kit christmas gift . after it professionally installed my car , i became instant fan xm radio . i soon started listening xm my home computer via xmradio online then decided go home apapter . xm radio sounds incredible my stereo system there little no interference . just remember ... don't let ac cord audio cables touch or you definitely get interference .	1
i case logic cd wallets 7+ years ago still good shape ... despite abuse i put them through . i bought this one only because cd collection expansion . i find simply wiping off outside cover wet sponge keeps it clean . nylon covers really hold up over time . remember- " 128 cd capacity " refers cds without their accompaning booklets . it really 64 cds booklets .	1
excellent headphones , shipped really quickly when i opened package one wasn't working , sent it back free charge received second package quickly well . love headphones	1
good quality 20 " money . don't expect much internal speakers though . ( 4 1/2 stars )	1
this particular piece hardware worked advertised . little sucker runs pretty hot but not appear affect its functioning . it works not failed me that all i care . ran it windowsxp	1
i ordered one these because my receiver only 1 optical input i needed second input my x-box 360 . i also ordered 2 relatively cheap optical cables parts express seller well . this splitter no optical connector end so short optical cable + longer one run one inputs 360 also necessary . other input used oppo 970hd dvd player i already cable use one . it pretty straight forward how use splitter . time spent hooking this up maybe 10 minutes max would've probably even less i quick access back my receiver . originally i no idea something like this existed i stumbled upon this product accident . price more than reasonable save you buying new receiver if you need second optical input . i've mine week not noticed distortion or changes sound quality . highly recommended	1
little dipole antenna comes most stereo tuners barely adequate fm reception . big outdoor fm antenna pain put up aim best reception . terk tried step into breach fm 50 amplified antenna . this amplifed folded dipole fully enclosed weather-resistant . it also mounted indoors , but length nearly 5 feet , it doesn't exactly blend drapes . but you're interested performance , or you wouldn't considering spending nearly 70 bucks this thing , would you ? well , amplifier low-noise type , filters out-of-band interference . gain somewhat variable . said , let talk briefly afc most radios . most tuners built lock onto strongest signal , if two adjacent frequencies . likewise , if filters used most stereos nowdays bit wider than absolutely necessary , order provide higher fidelity . if you trying pull weaker station adjacent stronger one , afc fight your efforts . amplifying signals only makes things worse . amplifiers more beneficial picking up weak stations not stations adjacen t.t he amplifier terk fm 50 turned off . folded dipole element itself , my opinion , excellent fm antenna . it pull weak stations right out noise . amplifier less effective , my opinion . if terk offered just antenna , sans amplifier , good price , i'd give it 5 stars . it good . but 70 bucks whole shebang bit steep , i think , what you get . if you're near city , you probably going leave amplifier turned off most time . you only get full benefit your 70 bucks if you live fringe reception area . one final minor gripe : your purchase doesn't even include coaxial lead-in cable . you'll go your neighborhood electronics store buy . quality , 5 stars . overall value , 3 stars	1
this little speaker system works great ! i bought it trip south beach . it fit nicely my carry backpack . there even place store my ipod also included small remote control skips next track highers lowers volume needed . outside this little system perfect . it not boom box type system , just enough you listen your music , it loud enough ! i like it alot ! i see this used room your house too .	1

i using this over month now . got it lt ; $300 , which less than most standalone auto gps systems several pdas . pros : -excellent value money . -performs all basic functions good auto gps system , some added ones . warm start times good . -everything you would expect windows mobile pda there . application performance fairly good . cons : -not fast many dedicated gps systems . there times when issue , especially when initially calculating route or recalculting you go off track need know which turn take quickly , traffic . -software interface much room improvement . e.g. not allow you move map see whats around when showing route map . you flip through some screens access . when addresses added contacts contact list , not attempt locate address . it manually located map . -cold start sat acquisition take while times . receiver not so good . -no built connectivity ( modem , wi-fi , bluetooth)bottomline : highly affordable gps pda functionality , one best values money , but not excel either	1
amazon description states this unit s-video which incorrect . this receiver great value otherwise	1
i got it . sometimes i don't want put headphones when my little daughter me . this thing fits top my pda mp3 player makes them both audible ( more audible case my pda ) . quality - ok - what you would expect something this size . style - forget it - look picture ! usefulness certain situations - yes ? only problem my pda case - when it closes it pops out mini speaker . radio shack solution $3	1

i bought $170 belkin bluetooth gps last year . bundled software quite useful but map display not detailed ( doesn't include rivers , water bodies parks ) enough compare ms pocket streets . it forced me put both programs my pda . one day i cut into website iguidance found its user interface almost same belkin . so i learned belkin software oem iguidance ( rev 1.1 ? )the best iguidance : very clear voice guidance . it advises you next turn many times -- few miles away , 2000 feet , 200 feet ( when you must turn right away ) . i once tried delorme , it told me only once -- many miles away that it ! i only need my ears when driving iguidance . it good safety everybody . if i miss turn , it re-calculate new route tell me what immediately . no panic . improvement iguidance 2.1.2 over 1.1 map details now rival ms pocket streets but w/o railroads . i think railroad useful landmark location reference . connection bluetooth gps receiver also improved . it takes much less " clicks " hook up bluetooth gps now . map data updated . i see newly built highway exit added . map details ms pocket streets still best . but ms two fatal shortcomings . 1 . no voice guidance . you keep staring pda display while driving ? 2 . it locks up time time . ms program freeze pda you must reset pda get it back . i've never experienced similar problem iguidance . " points interest search according your current location " feature iguidance also better than ms . what bad iguidance ? lack routing options . doesn't support voice commands . short , iguidance no-frill but useful tool	1
driving my car , working out gym , walking my dog doing chores around house , i spend least 10 hours week listening audio-books [ ... ] lectures teaching company . over years i've tried tapes , cds variety book readers including ipod zen . no book reader i've found works well this model c140 sandisk . it small , light , inexpensive , easy control , makes bookmarks reliably , makes it easy load unload audible books , makes it easy manage mp3 files using windows explorer . this player takes ordinary aaa batteries you get anywhere . my gym displays several tv screens " hamster room " uses short-range fm transmissions so members pick up station they want watch . so when i see tv program i want i switch over , it lets me quickly easily switch sansa fm tuner keep running . when sansa battery goes dead -- once every 12 hours -- i it takes seconds put aaa battery . they're cheap when i've forgotten put one my pocket , i've gotten replacements road-side convenience stores little convenience rack gym , but i've always able keep listening . audible recommends you download audio-books sansa level 4 format . level , sound quality excellent although , admittedly , player cannot turned up loud enough pound your eardrums unless you plug it into external amplifier play it through good set speakers . i got model c140 replace older sansa e140 i used two years . older one never gave me any trouble but this one said improved operating system making it easier control . i debated getting c150 twice memory only $[ ... ] higher price , but largest books i own ( biography harry truman fantasy book storm swords ) each over 40 hours long , either one fit c140 enough room left two ordinary length audio-books . c140 delivered all i hoped then some	1

first , clarification one listed features . it noted unit stop recording after 5 seconds silence -- this digital only feature not apply analog recording . i'd thought this great feature case i walked away while recording lp , but that just not case . second , it consistantly detect insert track while recording lp or tape ? no , though i it work perfectly few occassions . what frustrating there no rhyme or reason it . it hasn't always dependent sensitivity level set detecting tracks , or condition lp any scratches it may or may not . nothing obvious . positive , i haven't it set erroneous track marks during quit passages , i personally haven't any issues adding tracks manually . quick-start recording guide they provide -- oversized sheet connections 5-step recording process -- once patronizing confusing . i'm all simplifying while still covering bases , but i need line drawing shows finger pressing power button help me turn it ? doesn't " press power switch " cover it ? i mention this because instruction manually adding tracks that same guide far self-evident . their instruction " press track increment button " manually add tracks , but there no drawing finger button . there also no track increment button , no it not skip button . it record button , logic escapes me . you find this out owner manual , which really should read before recording anyway . it short uncomplicated illustrate handy features it . ( mentioned review , you choose analog or digital source you're recording ; default unexplicably set digital ) . quality recordings analog digital quite good . i'd planned getting new equalizer adjusting bootleg tapes upgrading my turntable etc ., but i've become more procastinator than technophile , decided bite bullet this teac . aside missing little high-end , it doing great job converting my records tapes so far . sure it'd great if track detector worked better , but i went into this not really expecting it perform too well , so i'm not disappointed . i wanted uncomplicated machine would solid job converting my records tapes , that what i feel i've got . yes i babysit recording if i want guarantee proper track markings , but that not completely unexpected . , they say , your results may vary .	1

i bought pair january loved them . sound lovely everyone describes . however , there something seriously lacking build quality . soft wires felt flimsy me when i first opened it , but i thought i'd just take extra care . 1 month careful usage , plastic-covered wires earbuds downwards became so weather-hardened i could almost use them chopsticks , makes it so earbuds popped out slightest motion . 2 months careful usage , wires half-ripped plug -- which i repaired best i could unsightly electrical tape . however , 3rd month , left bud fell completely off . i am very disappointed -- it one best-sounding phones i've ever ( i've owned both grado s60 s90 , sennheisers ) , but man , they need something making this baby last	1

overall , helix lives up new generation xm recievers . i especially like option able store my own mp3s unit well recording xm content either time frame or song song basis . only problem here sometimes fades cut off when recording song . those us familiar xm know units not work well indoors unless connected antenna home kit . car antenna seems work fine , par my delphi myfi unit . built antenna helix marginal . i able get decent signal positioning unit , however , when walking or moving reception definitely intermittent . this where my pre recorded mp3 xm content comes handy . i would rated unit higher if helix not falsely advertised able transmit fm receiver both home car docks . prior purchase , i even went far downloading manual which specifically states unit this feature . this simply not true unit transmits fm car dock only . i am enjoying helix , but object purchase fm transmitter home use .	1

great idea . run where you want know how far you've gone . breadcrumb trail pretty useless it doesn't hold signal wooded areas but knowing how far you've gone , how fast you're going , this thing great	1
very average quality speaker system . too much noise even low volumes . even highest recording quality files , volume horribly noisy .	1
i three these now ... they work great ! i've used them transport data files mp3 files . i lexar sport mp3 player uses these usb drives storing mp3 files . i one new drive problem where mp3 player " forgot " usb drive place . it if i pulled drive out player without shutting it off . re-seating drive fixed problem i not seen problem since . maybe it fluke . getting it out packaging challenge , though	1
i wont add anything sound , they sound fine me . i never over ear worried they would not comfortable , besides , they look strange . they take bit getting used , but i love them now ( 2 months , 1-2 hours day ) . i work lab , need wires out way my stuff ; behind ear helps wire stay closer my body not dangle front , especialy front my face neck/upper chest area . ( lower , wire tucked behind my lab-coat leading down zen my belt . ) i feel much more secure than my older regular earbuds .	1
my router : linksys wrt54gc - compact wireless routeri skeptical first because all negative reviews this antenna , but my concerns now put rest because it really improved strength my wireless range quality . i already excellent signal connection throughout my apartment terms percentages ( 55% lowest , 3-4 bars ) but my connection wasn't very reliable . i experiencing dropped connections no apparent reason besides possible interference neighboring aps my apartment complex . even strongest 100% connections dropping every so often wrt54gcs internal antenna , which very small when i last look internals . now hga7s linksys antenna i am getting 70-75% connection same area previously giving me 55% , now my connection excellent 5 bars 54mbps . best thing new antenna i no longer dropped connections my internet experience better : no more lag , faster throughput , stable connection . antenna swivels around 360 degrees bends 90 degrees vertical horizontal . feature also helped my wireless usb dongle i connected my computer tower which oriented horizontal . aligning antenna usb dongles orientation helped signal quality go up . overall excellent product if you problems signal quality dropped packets . really helped my situation	1

i read reviews belkin n-1 networking family scared leave my pre-n system behind . however , my pre-n router died true their word belkin promptly replaced it . this point i willing invest belkin n-1 laptop card just see how it performed . fact i bought 2 . i installed one card couple year old dell which upstairs location while router downstairs . laptop reports very good excellent signal amd " 300 mbps " - it noticable faster pulling files other network devices . other laptop bit older gateway . it too upstairs , directly overhead router . it not report strong signal but seems get job reports faster than " 108 mbps " sometimes " 300 mbps " . while i not experimented placing stronger signaled dell location gateway see how it performs , i suspect difference attributable gateway older technology . greatest challenge i setting up network security . i succeeded security mode wpa/wpa-2 personal ( psk ); authentication wpa/psk ; encryption technique aes ( i could not establish connection my computers using tkp encryption technique ) . summary , setting up network took some effort familiarity networks - how set change properties network connection both laptops browser interface router . once network established its performance reliable faster . all-in-all i would not make investment surf-the-net but if you access larger files , like photographs , computer or network drive , you notice difference - if bandwidth hardware you using par n-1 capabilities . make this come true me i upgraded nic my computers which hardwired router 1gb technology . upgrade worthwhile given my network drive , where photographs stored capable transfer rate 250 mbps my zip drive usb 2.0 . other words , all my hardware capable faster transfer rates .	1
after breaking my cx-300 due it thin cord i decided try out er-6i . those clearest treble i've heard , but lacking seriously mids bass regarding music my ipod . putting it into sound source back home them sounding better , but they weren't good what i would using them , on-the-go listening . so i decided take look these . bass these equivalent cx-300 or slightly better . mids treble where these headphones head up cx-300's; much crisper , clearer , sound more " alive " . thicker cord step up cx-300 , where you could hear everytime cord rubbed against your shirt . noise-cancelling same cx-300 , maybe few decebels more if any . case 3 more pairs buds nice addition compared cx-300 which only come different fitting buds . i own pair quietcomfort 3 home , i'd say these perfect compliment on-the-go listening . my only hesitation giving these 5 stars treble isn't great er-6i ( but er-6i don't overall quality , least my ipod ) . definately use smallest buds work your ear . i've used small buds both cx-300 metro.fi 2 , great results both . it allows monitors sit inside canal , getting better overall sound . i'd recommend these slightly above cx-300 , but both pretty good deals give you great mobility while maintining audio quality . i'm still trying break-in these headphones , but right now , they're sounding great .	1
this gift christmas i absolutely love it . sound spectacular it nice something i carry me so many places . i friend bose speaker setup her ipod sounds good but it big not portable . sound my jlab speakers just good i carry them around house take it me when i travel . it great ipod slides right back so i don't worry cords or connections like some other systems . i couldn't more pleased showed recommended it several people .	1

( not too difficult , all ) . i'm using cb firestik antenna mount firestik usa flag antenna . instead trying blend cb antenna into car color , now it bit showier . advantage high mount , low enough off back door frame clear my garage . it now even easier locate my clown car parking lots when larger vehicle blocks view , antenna still visible . overall i loved price ease install , no frills cb , pa option must me . antenna mount most expensive part this project	1

let me start saying i love these speakers almost more than ipod itself ! i searched every store could not find product all these features ipod shuffle ( 1st generation ) . price also very reasonable product built this well . i've used these speakers indoors outdoors least year now always get compliments friends , family , strangers how good sound coming these speakers . i use speakers outside our deck all summer long enjoy able listen my ipod without headphones . i get much more use my ipod this way . i've taken speakers beach everywhere you could imagine . included carrying case power cord great i use those all time . it definitely important me able use batteries or power cord , this product delivers ! normal aa batteries last very long . it also terrific when plugged into ac ( wall outlet ) it charges shuffle while you listen music . there many other products like this stores , but they sound horrible fall apar t.t his may best product i've purchased last 5years !! i can't recommend it enough ! it also works anything mini headphone jack too ( like any mp3 player or portable cd players )	1
i used these headphones consistently past four years - they far most comfortable headphones i ever worn . aside unique tactile feedback they give , one principle reasons i like them they no block ear canal result you wear them still hear clearly anyone insists talking you while you wearing them	1
ever wonder how many amazon product reviews submitted corporate shills ? case dgl-4100 , i'm ready guess it 85% . okay , i'm not totally serious serious estimate . i'm just disappointed product . i'm not gamer , perhaps that why dgl-4100 didn't work me . i like download tv programs via bittorrent . i download whole seasons time , which runs into multiple gigabytes . you other bittorrent enthusiasts may know , average home network router tendency freeze when bt pulls too many connections through it . i find it very depressing get up morning ( or come home work ) find my downloads stopped short many hours ago . some months now i've search affordable router avoid this problem . considering what i've spent so far , perhaps i would've better off buy something expensive capacious start . any case , it difficult derive any sort consensus router efficacy web . there probably more than few lying corporate shills floating around cyberspace , but mostly there well-meaning people who report good or bad results without taking into account operating system , exact router model , broadband type , bittorrent client , or size torrents they download . i mildly excited find so many positive amazon reviews dgl-4100 . perhaps , i thought , router built high-performance gaming would account connection issues similar bittorrent . right now , cognescenti reading this little tale woe probably laughing their butts off . let me cut chase here . after i hooked up dgl-4100 started two bt downloads ( one mere 1.5 , other 22 ) , everything looked fine ... three hours . then silly thing froze me , happened linksys netgear routers ( wired wireless ) i've tried . i obtained latest firmware it ( january 11 , 2006 ) , installed this , tried again . results similar , except now i noticed router freezing me even during bt-free web-surfing . regardless my bittorrent client ( azureus , utorrent , bitcomet)or its settings , results didn't improve . if you're gamer , maybe you'll roll dice dgl-4100 . if you're bittorrent enthusiastic such myself , you should probably keep looking	-1

hi , i'm vince radioman i've large collection radios i love compares share my thoughts . eton 10 ( e1 e100 ) vast improvement over old grundig line radios . you immediatly see feel difference quality how radio made . it robust memory ( 500 presets ) complete functionality including wide/narrow band selection interference filter which seems work well . tuner sensativity dynamic range very good considering price . it antenna trim feature which pleasure not usually available radio this price range . i enjoy am dxing good results , not quite good sony 7600 or sangean ats909 . sangean priced way above 10 but sony 7600 just bit more but ssb which 10 not . 10s cosmetic design /sleekness wonderful i've said earlier ... well made radio !! control buttons bit small cause issues those us large hands , but not show stopper . my actual rating here 4 half stars , i really like this radio but its not sony , it some hiss selectivity issues , but none less very good buy money .	1

echo most recent review here , i'm something audiophile myself , also sold high-end audio products years ago , buti getting annoyed my new compaq pcwith basic realtek97 onboard audio wasn't even close quality i hearing my newsony dvd player matched set good thx/dolby alteclansing surround speakers , just no comparison . but spend $200 sound card pc that'snot high end anyway absurd , yet i wanted make pc 5.1 digital out capable , boost general stereo audio , when i found out aurilium i jumped it . i got mine two weeks ago i think moneyit really great device , couldn't easier set up , looks fabulous sleek , it even reminds you if speakers aren't configured right , or if you need enable ac3/dolby digital pass-through external dolby decoder or receiver , which really useful touch . software simple , intuitive , helpful easy navigate use . i don't know how philips makes this usb-bus powered , but it works damned well sound card doesn'trequire its own ac power source , although most internal cardsdon't anyhow . test playing new copy dvdof 2001 : space odyssey remastered 5.1 sound , which sounded devastating my main sony surround system , it sounds just good now pc dvd player throughthe aurilium , digital out or not , both methods sounded great . i can't recommend this more highly , wise purchasefor those who want good audio 5.1 digital surroundsound music , movies gaming , budget . plus you don't open up your pc or laptop install it , something i found just icing cake . if you want audiophile high quality go buy yourselfan onkyo or harmon kardon surround system $1000 klipsch 5.1 speakers , but if you , why bother pc audio anyway ? quality pc sound aurilium aces . i also impressed thorough , easy understandnature instructions software help menus , they really cover almost everything you would need know operate card set it up optimal performance	1

i've seen number negative reviews this product , however i think their problem their particular player not model itself . i've my creative zen month now i take it everywhere i go . it works beautifully ! sound quality amazing it so easy use ! my only wish price gone down before i got it it now $20 cheaper . when i first got it it took me bit figure out how manage playlists such but all worked out . i one scare when it froze second day use . reviewer sited same problem , frozen no sound . i don't know what they're talking " waiting 3 days battery die " though . player stuck it only took number hours it die . once i recharged it it worked perfectly i haven't problem since . i use it every day walking classes ( i'm college student ) . my final comment this : price it currently ( $79.99 ) it steal . it works like dream , sound quality beautiful it simple operate . i certainly recommend this product anyone . i went ipod ( which never worked ) creative zen it like breath fresh air	1
i case garmin gps it just belt clip you slide off your belt , unfortunately , it come off your belt ( which it often ) you lose your gps unit good . this explorist case comes real nice strong wide secure strip you undo your belt loop your belt through , so when you out hiking , you don't keep checking afraid it fell off your belt , because there no way this case come off without you taking your belt off ! nice ! it not just loop string or rope either , it better described belt or strip tough material attached real secure case . true , you can't quickly slide case off your belt clip , but why would you need take case off , you take gps out when you need it case stays belt where it safe can't get dropped or lost . $7 this great case . i get gps out quickly easily . i like secure , yet easy open zipper opposed velcro flap my garmin case . only negative i would i would liked padding bit thicker , but i suppose i always slide strong piece leather or something into it inside better protect gps impact case . there enough room this still able get gps unit out without problem . what else you buy only $7 today ?	1
i purchased these set together 6 additional expandable phones . they work great . we large house 6 bedrooms range very good . these phones come great features . i am using voip service these units so far i no complaints . one features we really like intercom . i dont go upsairs get my daughter out bed morning . i just call her	1

not buy this your xbox . it sucks . unit functional ( well , not defective ) ' dialing ' unit it able communicate ( w/o wires ) my computer . first red flag when xbox not recognize dwl-g820 wireless adapter . this normal . it configured ip address , which ridiculous because wired router connection normally plug play . however , no amount configuration xbox dashboard would allow xbox connect wirelessly . this even assistance tech support , which spotty best . folks nice enough , but getting through take very long time . i'm okay networks - all my other stuff works great - but definitely not expert , i could go changes i made . i won't , though . if you prefer painless set-up it probably best match brands when designing wireless network . i'll give d-link benefit doubt admit i using router different brand , but all configuration options both ends , this should not matter . oh , i read some earlier reviews i agree this thing runs real hot . who knows what that'll product longevity because i don't plan keep it . if i ever got it function properly i small children , then i'd probably mount it out their reach	-1

i bought m-audio 49e usb controller keyboard my mac month ago . i'm adult returning piano after many , many years since those dull piano lessons kid . i bought piano few years ago it sits our living room . i'm graphic designer/photographer spend most my waking hours front my mac . i played around garageband thought usb keyboard would allow me sit here my comfy office chair practice while my husband watches tv living room . i miss rich sound real piano , but this keyboard great casual re-beginner practice . nothing fancy , no myriad buttons displays distract lot fun change combine instruments garageband , which excellent software . natch . what else would you expect apple ? m-audio keyboard light , durable , simple sits neatly above my keyboard drawer front cinema display ( which also acts handy music stand ) . only negative i possibly come up springyness keys curve get used . not ever played expensive keyboard , it easy get used this one . practicing simple songs , i no problem missing octaves , dedicated buttons make them easily accessible . my purpose , this keyboard perfect price doesn't break budget	1

after using this product 3 months i am yet find something wrong it . we using it ms streets trips . it works flawlessly . it gets fix ( cold start ) any setting - urban canyon settings , high speeds freeway , wooded areas , inside my apartment . it even works if you keep it glove box your car . we driven through tunnels . it loses signal few meters into tunnel ( not surprising ) gets fix flawlessly couple seconds leaving tunnel . software no trouble communicating reciever . we tried it 2 different versions ms streets trips three different laptops . basic knowledge bluetooth pairing set up breeze . battery life exceptional . it comes complete kit ac charger , dc charger leather pouch . you can't ask more . it really compact ( smaller than most cell phones ) not too heavy either . other gps reciever i tried delorme eartmate . delorme would never fixate signal when driving ( cold start ) . we always pull over get fix then start driving . delorme always lost signal if you drove 3 or 4 storey buildings . hardly described urban canyon ! it horrible !	1

i bought this product gift some friends - following directions carefully , they only able get one speakers work intermittantly - after i got speaker system back them , i gave it try - bad results , worse this time - only static one speaker - i double checked make sure i installed everything correctly including making sure correct power adapters attached speakers - no go - , then , when i went return it company whom i bought it canada , i got royal run around - finally after lots phone calls mail issues ( don't get me started " customs " issues ) i returned product got price speakers back - however , no refund shipping either way which amounted $89 total - so ... two things : [ 1 ] product shabby not worth price ( go sharper image buy theirs - better product , cheaper price ) [ 2 ] never buy anything amazon.com not american supplier	-1

these rca headphones ? what happened quality products they used put out ? i tell you right now , these aren't it . many letdowns very few if any advantages these earphones . spend your money get something else . first problem these earphone how they fit feel your head . since phones not feature swiveling feature like seen most other headphone sets , you put them your head they feel like they're going fall off . you constantly adjust tuning dials achieve constant clear signal . signal becomes distorted or can't recieved all if you go far upstairs bedroom which directly above transmitter or anywhere range . other problems reception include popping noises static within very short distance transmitter . automatic turn off feature which makes this model poor choice . if sound source too low , such certain scene movie or something , headphones shut off within 30-60 seconds . this usually come big surprise you when volume level changes you hear loud static coming speakers which cause most people jump fall out their chair surprise . last problem these headphones battery cover very hard get off back again after replacing batteries . due way headphones attached so tightly band . you fight cover get it up through band . save your money go something else	-1

gps works great ! said , i'm disappointed 5919 overall . i could not get free map updates tomtom because hp not include navigator 6 product code 5915 . hp support promised they'd get maps post them 5915 users , but hasn't happened after several months promises . wireless worked only non-encrypted networks , even then , only 1 day . i perform soft-reset least three times day because system hangs . mp3s play fine . it play video , albeit they very choppy . usb connections computer seem work only after loading very latest ms activesync , only after soft-reset . even then , computer recognize device very " iffy " . unit great idea if you travel -- maps , email , internet , music , contacts , appointments , etc ., but if it doesn't work , it becomes paperweight . i've read dozens forums others complaining same issues . hp support so far nothing but lip service . my recommendation--don't fall marketing hype , this unit still lot bugs worked out	1

" step 1 : scratch removal " not scratch removal all . it supposed sit 5 minutes , then you wipe it . i let it sit overnite once scratch still there . after you apply junk , instructions say apply " step 2 : cleaner , polisher , sealer " . this stuff practically water . it doesn't work all . after you cd should like new . i don't think so ! holder you put cd while you're cleaning it too flimsy . only good thing i use " scratch remover " small scratches my digital camera , cell phone , psp , other electronics . not buy this unless you like ruining cd . last word : i hate maxell .	-1

i agree previous reviewer - there lot static interference these things . we actually hardly ever use them reason - our house small enough we hear music other room through walls doorways , least it doesn't sound like am radio stormy day . also , they huge " wall warts " - big converters (?) cords . finding inconspicuous place plug them impossible , since all inconspicuous places behind furniture , which can't put close wall anymore size things plugs . i guess you get what you pay - i would paid more if i known how bad these would	1

i use this mic recording my vocals guitar ( both together ) computer this mic absolutely wonderful job . plugged ' mic ' input normal consumer soundcard ( ectiva , which i ) , it gives very good quality recordings , considering its price . even atmosphere , air blowing or foot taps or vehicles passing ( not very loud though ) , it catches no noise . it truely uni-directional , i.e. it record only sound , which you produce front it , certain narrow angle . it almost competes mics like shure sm57 or condenser mics etc . you see it yourself here my soundpage , where each every recording made using this mic ( vocals guitar both simultaneously recorded through this mic ) here - www.soundclick.com/gn-rahulthe kinks you may notice * not * because this mic . it only result my very less ram ( only 128 ) running audacity win 98 se . computers ram more than 256 mb , this mic record like breeze . perfect recording acoustic guitar yours course your vocals . works great karaoke mic too . what else you want ? it requires no xlr cables all expensive stuff . it record all drums etc you too . shure sm57 or any 100 $ something mic , you get 10s this . go it ! great	1

i just received my zen micro leather pouch , i must say it good case . i really like magnetic closure feature . you just fold top flap down bottom flap up magnet holds it place . first i worried magnet would mess up my credit cards key-cards my wallet , but it hasn't anything bad them i doubt it . i think fold made way it because when you wearing pouch your belt , it provides easier access controls . you easily flop down flap turn down volume your zen micro if you need talk someone hurry . i agree poorab respect top hole little small , ( where you plug your head-phones , usb , access hold/power switch ) . top screen little hard see case place . this makes it little hard read battery meter . all all , i like looks case , i think it let me carry protect my new zen microphoto just way i want it	1

i one external sony burner ( drx530ul)with great experience branded dvd medias , but not genetic ones . still i happy it it seems you always find good deals these days blank dvd discs . dvd burner came my other ( sony ) computer all sudden started destory my +rw discs recently after nearly zero usage one year ( somehow i use computer more often , one external burner attached ) so i get internal one replace . ( way i probably should reviewed oem burner zero star but decided not bother ) . i went research found this which great reputation since it out , many noted this model burns most including genetic dvd medias . so i went it ( plus i orignally wanting get sony match computer ) it hasn't disappointed me over month usage . great product highly recommend it . got dvd-ram but yet got time test . tried out several branded/genetic rw discs , all great my 5+ year dvd player ( toshiba)can play them well	1

i would give this 5 stars but few things : - included earbuds uncomfortable fall out my ears during exercise- syncing sometimes buggy- you load all podcasts manually- podcasts seem ordered date player , no matter how you arrange them itunesrecent releases itunes solved some , but not all , sync issues . also , i read some workarounds podcast ordering problem , but they involve rebuilding your library , furthermore what i've read they're just temporary fixes . apple needs fix this . still , small form factor , cool design , easy-to-use controls make this great product . i sold my 4g 40gb ipod right after i got this , i no regrets .	1
i love it two different modes- you shuffle your playlist or just listen it order you put play list your computer . i also like fact you don't fuss batteries , charge lasts really long time . it very compact , clip holds well . it doesn't take long synch my computer i thought it would , it doesn't take very long charge ( couple hours ) especially compared how long charge lasts ( my sister-in-law using hers least hour every day over month still hasn't recharge it ) . this product gets two thumbs up me . only downside you may want consider ipod nano instead if you want more than 250 songs there	1
this all-in-one printer revolutionized my home office . only $100 , i high quality printed documents , copies , scans photos home exceed capabilities many small businesses . pros : print quality excellent fast . black text works well , several people commented high quality color photos printed just plain white paper . scan quality quite good , easy use . photocopy functions easy use , color copy surprising bonus . many offices very expensive professional printers don't copy color , yet this little $100 machine copies color so well it nearly impossible tell original copy . other nice features include very helpful utilities software included , particularly arcsoft photo studio . i like fact it only needs two ink cartridges instead five so it easy maintain . nice touch handy little slider props unit open during maintenance . cons : my largest complaint this unit high cost replacement ink cartridges , which cost $25-30 each high quality retail replacements . only few months i've spent more than twice cost whole printer just ink . it seems it requires ink changes more quickly too than other canon hp printers i used . other issues , size little wide awkward it feels slightly off-balance weight . print tray should longer support paper -- instead , paper bends backwards awkwardly slide out place . i also wish it could hold more paper . overall : aside cost ink frequency cartridge replacements , i am very happy this printer . previously , i thought home photocopy machine unnecessary ( somewhat decadent ) luxury , but i've surprised many times how very useful it . technology amazing ! printing , scanning copying everything advertised high quality speed . i really like this machine	1

radio arrived right beginning i could tell sound far superior realistic table radio i using . old radio very muddy sounding while tivoli very clear . instruments background when listening realistic now front center . improvement dramatic i'm glad i spent money . added bonus , it 1/8 input jack so i use my ipod it . here few misc nuggets info . amazon comments said am radio reception bad , well you add fm reception if you rely internal antenna . one area realistic beats tivoli hands down . good news tivoli comes external antenna you plug made huge improvement . it comes unusually long extension cord . wrapped up it almost 1/2 size radio itself ! fairly inconvenient when trying keep it tucked behind radio table top . i also read base emphasized too much but so far i it seems fine me . perhaps because i listen jazz which not boom boom some music . one last interesting item , radio very small but also very heavy side speaker . apparently there quite magnet there ! if i critisize it any way i would mention again huge power cord i would also like some type tone control . so , conclude i would say it one darned expensive table top radio $120 ( now sale $100 course ) but it sounds very very good such small box . fact , my wife commented it didn't sound like sound coming little radio all . i don't know i would go far but it fairly open given such small source . dav	1

i received this speaker gift xmas . when i first plugged it , i experienced same problem other people complained ... voices seemed weak difficult understand . i turned db level all way up it became tolerable , but still not very good . i then happened across website discussed speaker placement . it suggested placing center speaker directly above or below tv ( duh ) , but also said make sure it reasonably level tweeters side speakers ( within foot ) . i made this adjustment wow ! it like night day . sound incredible ! those you who problems might want try something these lines , those you checking this speaker out stores should make sure everything aligned properly when you listen . hope helps	1
before buying this product you absolutely go web site try find out if they support your printer . their web site absolutely atrocious . it so slow constantly refreshes so it almost useless . they link back box list compatible printers so go directly it . i hp g85 officejet multi-function printer setup not work all . tech support useless . they kept trying ask me what brand computers i network what my isp . none this mattered except marketing department . it drove me nuts . after 5 phone calls i finally got hold technical support person confirmed my printer not compatible . separately , even if you compatible printer you should aware serious bug software if you use 128 bit wep security your wireless network like we . unless your network uses key 1 ( 4 ) you cannot hook print server into your wireless network . there radio buttons support other keys but they not work . tech support acknowledged issue . all all horrible experience . it shame because their wireless routers almost decent	-1

mousepad side things , this double-sided mat high quality all way around . it aluminum surfaces attached each side thin , but sturdy aluminum plate . i use speed side since it smoother , razer deathadder i also recently purchased . amazon sold out these -- razer store them . wrist rest also just high quality . it actually uses memory foam cushion which much more comfortable than cheap gel material typically found mouse wrist rests . it also dip middle making it very comfortable long gaming sessions . keep this mind if you're considering gaming mousepad . wrist rest optional , but it adds stability ( it large rubber mat + rest , mousepad sits top mat part )	1
unit satisfying advirtised all ways . i thought max volume limitation peak not close what unit could produce , ( maybe least 20% more without distortion ) volume control not go farther than allowed uni t.t he clock dark useless , it not bright enough see any distance . lastly , their no audio out port allow any singals 3 audio sourses play well through excelent speakers shelf size transmited source , it computer or sound sytem . headphone output could used computer input use , but this signal amplified . strange how this missing audio out port some lesser systems , not this one . ( there audio port , but isn'nt sort useless , if this unit 3 good audio sources ? )the unit size fine office , liv room or den not sound sytem giant party , only background music . treble control would also useful , additon bass boost least 10 % , but i suppose bass background more pleasant than treble boosted signals . overall , unit job my studio , price far above others qualtiy , size performance . i assume equalizer would driven price up , well higher max volume level . ( i would paid extra $20 . ) you get what you paid , this system fully advirtised corrrectly	1

cowon iaudio x5 heir iriver player - high-end , get-out-and-push type player people who fussy their music , who don't mind managing it closely . sound excellent , this main selling point . many players referred " portable stereos " . this machine truly . where sound ipod extremely good , iaudio clarity lively presence sets it apart . iaudio boasts some sophisticated audio enhancement technology , but honest , plain sound so good you really won't need fiddle it all . good headphones you hear cough violin bow , or pick out each instruments brass section . it worth ripping your music higher bit rate enjoy improvement , or use uncompressed flac instead mp3 or ogg . luckily , there 60 gb drive your large , high-quality music files sit . controls easy enough manage , though it take little while get used them . all content organized file structure , just like folders computer . when connected computer x5 shows up extra drive , so you copy back forth easily . you transfer any type file you like using file manager , if you don't mind using expensive player storage device , you carry your work files back forth well . music , user interface also file-based , x5 not keep internal database like ipod or iriver . it read id3 tags tell you what file , though it also appears ignore unicode tags . this means you're confined albums ( or folders ) , possibly file names . so , if you want follow particular thread or particular genre , this means extra work . best way listen non-album-based way compile playlists , either creating them computer programs such winamp , or through mastering somewhat quirky dynamic playlists . ( dynamic playlist function doesn't recurse correctly , so you add one album time . ) terms amenities , cowon provides set software tools you use rip transfer content , though you'll probably your own favorites , which you continue use . unlike ipod , you're not constrained your choice software . most useful cowon utility would video converter . device itself attractive , light sturdy . external connections handled proprietary ( easy-to-lose ) detachable connector block . you might want order extra put it away , case these things ever turn out hard find . alternatively , cowon makes dock , which most convenient way set things up . it inexpensive , though it optional ordered separately . screen small , but very colorful pleasing , you choice what information appears during playback . my personal opinion movies belong big screen , so perhaps someone else comment video capabilities . demo looks convincing enough , but again , my interest iaudio ... well ... audio . i bought x5 after many ( happy ) years ipods , no other reason than see what else out there . it always good try something new , sometimes you're pleasantly surprised when you depart norm . iaudio takes some getting used , but overall , it impressive enjoyable machine . i like fact it different , wow - it really sound good !	1

when my toshiba vcr remote starting giving me problems , i decided look into universal replacement . i don't care their usual bulkiness , so this one stood out because its slim-line design . reviews positive price unbelievably low , so i took chance . it even nicer than i'd hoped . it slim , so it handles easily ; it light , buttons well placed . its programmability learning capability allow it anything your other remotes capable , you pretty much place these functions whatever keys you wish ( read instructions first--it easy . i believe reviewer who complained unit only controlling limited number functions not fully read instructions utilized programming/learning capability . i'm impressed what it , which includes everything my vcr remote ) . keys reusable devices ; , key that set up particular function one device totally free new setting when you switch device mode . it isn't backlit , which not particular problem me , but might feature someone else needs . i bought second one . i purchased " 6 device " , then bought " 8 " second , i tell you only difference them two additional device controls --- there no other added functions " 8 " --- but , it didn't need any ( well , maybe backlighting thing ) . i haven't it long , so i can't speak durability , although i dropped it couple occasions it unfazed . it actually seems very sturdy . i guess i'm trying figure out why such low-priced remote so nice . i can't . if you're looking simple , but effective , universal remote , or just replacement or extra one , you won't disappointed this purchase .	1
i've this bag almost year now i couldn't happier it . i don't use it college it little too big me everyday use(but then , i'm 5 feet tall ) . this great bag if you're planning overnight trip ( or week long trip ) don't want bothered lot luggage . i like take my laptop everywhere i go this bag i take my weekend trips . it keeps laptop secure there plenty room few sets clothes other odds ends . it not plastic supporters that shown picture . but it small partition main compartment , which hold big book(you push this partition back if don't want use it ) . it takes weight off your shoulders . pros : great designholds just anythingfeels light your shouldershas waist strap ( if ever you want one)can double up laptop-cum-overnight-bagcons : this only things i think - it little too big everyday college use ( it might work if you're tall like carry all your books you)overall , i give it 5 stars because only con it doesn't really bother me	1

i'll never buy branded power adapter laptop original manufacturer anymore . i like extra plug - one keep home one keep my laptop bag so i don't constantly grab cord . since price less than buying real sony , hp , or whatever ac adapter , multiple plugs it more flexible , this great choice . when you outgrow your laptop , you still use it . note : don't buy car/airplane adapter only . their little bit cheaper , but most time you'll still want carry ac adapter so you'd end up stuffing both regular power adapter car/airline adapter into your bag . better just buy one " all-in-one " like this keep your original power cord home extra . i haven't used in-line splitter charge cellphone or pda . i'm not sure i find useful since i carry my actual cellphone charger cable anyway - i wouldn't trust not it	1

i got this special amazon ($99 +free shipping ) , which only reason i purchased it . klipsch , i think , little crazy their expectation this system worth $299 . why i think this ? well , terms bang buck , this system falls short - especially when you consider unless you digital source this essentially 2.1 system . 2.1 realm , you find many systems higher per channel wattage than this far less cost . if cost okay , you certainly find more feature packed systems price . any number well-equipped bookshelf systems come mind , including some excellent offerings onkyo denon . i can't comment 5.1 capabilities . if you don't need features , prefer quality volume , then read . audio performance redeeming factor , there gmx d- 5.1 holds its own against traditional audio systems , trounces most other computer audio products . 3 " main driver satellite , this system reasonable chance midrange performance . midrange , while admirable , still sounds anemic comparison my reference speakers due falloff mid-bass frequencies . satellites rely sub help here , which course leads muddy imaging particularly noticeable male vocals . tweeter blends well midrange gives good high frequency definition without too directional , though it might too prominent frequencies above 8khz some listeners . sub gives exceptional performance audiophile , provided you aren't kind person who accepts nothing less than pair 12 your car . notes distinct completely lack rumbling or booming quality ubiquitous low priced . 1 components . extension admirable 6.5 " driver , though output limited south 40hz . system claims 108db spl , while i'm sure possible , anything above 102db it starts losing its charm . this undoubtedly due 1% thd found 10 wpc rated output . 2%thd sub much less noticeable . fit finish exceptional , particularly subwoofer . satellites distinct " ikea-new-age-lamp " feel them , but sub very traditional matte black solid construction . i don't any problems overgrown hockey puck control panel . it fits nicely my desk , though it isn't ideal small workspace . it fit atop sub , should you choose place accessible area . $100 , this system performs exceptionally , overall sound quality far better than most comparably featured systems . advantage diminishes regular price , gmx d- 5.1 melds into pack .	1

when you look picture sony mdr-j10 headphones , you probably think " great idea ! " i certainly , i thought they'd answer my annoyances earbuds falling out while i run . well , that partly true . over-ear design ingenious , there no slippage whatsoever , which refreshing . but design also its most major flaw : most headphone speakers which project directly into your inner ear , but placement speakers this set such they face forward into tragus ( projection cartilage sticks out your ear ) , which means sound inherently distorted . you adjust placement somewhat but , me , it feels like i'm simply choosing less annoying variation distorted sound . what more , overall sound bit tinny weak my tastes . i realize these very inexpensive headphones , but even running , i can't cope such thin-sounding music . after trying these , i switched back earbuds i already owned found it less annoying they fell out occasionally -- after all , they sound great when they stay , which more than i say sony mdr-j10 headphones .	-1

i mixed feelings this product . idea behind it fine -- keep all your cds/dvds one place , away too much handling . problem sony implementation mediocre best . user interface * terrible * ; so bad you almost can't believe they'd release product like this . you need keyboard anything reasonable , " load info dvd " feature barely works . when it , it wrong uneditable . remote control so poorly laid out it almost comical . most important button , get list your dvds , labeled " folders " tiny bad location . plus once all your dvds loaded , then what ? you only support one tv ... i other tvs dvd player car , so i either unload them ( device forgets everything ) , or copy all dvds i need use multiple machines . if you not sure whether get this , i'd consider buying your movies itunes using appletv , or some other similar model . you might also consider any fair use provisions let you keep copy dvds you rightfully own permanent insertion into this device ( although interface still absolutely horrible ) . if remote user interface actually functional elegant , i'd probably feel differently this product	1

purchasing this cable set , you limiting your options . you now must use your a/v receiver sound whenever you play game because you loose analog sound connection you 400 ( analog sound comes out same port video ) . spend 10 dollars you save inexpensive optical cable you now best both worlds , you option using tv sound or a/v receiver same quality video . i say video quality my 62 " hdtv improved dramatically addition component ( red , green , blue ) video gamelink 400 over composite ( one video cable ) connection comes ps2 . however if you're kind person who thinks 450 must better because it bigger number than 400 , it probably won't matter you anyway ..	-1

i bit apprehensive after reading all these negative reviews , but i thought i'd give it try myself , return it if it didn't work ou t.t urns out i am pleased . main thing i bought it watch downloaded avi movie files my tv over my wireless network , it job perfectly . i surprised quality picture . no video pauses or skipping issues . i haven't it lose network once . it simple set up . while it wasn't detecting my wireless network , but then i realized it wasn't units fault , it my wireless network . i just needed reboot router . after it effortless . if main thing you purchasing this video playback , then buy it . it works great . but if your main objective music or photos , it somewhat sub-par . its not unusable , it just could use some improvement those areas i'm sure there better units out there music player . i think lot negative reviews result people setup problems giving up , or people who wanted use it mainly photos or music .	1
usual , sandisk give us great memory card , used all memorystick pro compatible products , like my sony cli� peg-nz90 my sony cybershot dscs60 .	1
after reading other reviews , i decided go ahead get these . especially what they cost , they get job . like reviewer stated , make sure hammer carpet spikes into base before doing anything else . take your time assembling them . drive screws just enough stick out top bottom pieces then line them up holes supports before driving them rest way . otherwise , you risk splitting wood ( or whatever you call what they made out ) . after assembly , careful when moving them carpet or you easily snap spikes off ( it happened me ) . my stands partially hidden behind some furniture so they not noticable . if yours going out open , you may want spring higher end model	1
garmin , edge 305 heart rate/cadence , set standard literally eliminated competition . only thing others this point copy attempt duplicate . we ( 2 ) hr cad . both used flats los angeles county hills orange/san diego county . gps never failed work . actually nothing edge 305 failed work 1000 miles each . you program screen display multiple items glance see all your desired information . i monitor speed , distance , elapsed ride time , time day , hr , cad calories . heck , edge 305 better than bike ! training software also outstanding . only negatives nothing actual computer performance my opinion include : * price-this toy aint cheap . * size-relatively big bike computer , but very light . * battery-our units both safe four ( 4 ) six ( 6 ) hours .	1

i really trying hard love this headset because sound awesome . but ( this big but ) - i couldn't get satisfactory response microphone . problem seemed it never close enough your mouth due it completely separate unit . you supposed clip it your shirt or mount it your monitor enclosed clip device . mic separate it so far away i either set my sensitivity up so high it picked up everything room , or else i yell get it hear me ( then it still picked up lot background noise ) . i take set back get one attached microphone since i mainly play online games my brother-in-law he simply couldn't hear me all this microphone . ( i tried every combination settings various control panels , both game within windows creative control panels . ) pros : - awesome sound- very comfortable- three piece unit ( so you use headphones your mp3 player)cons : - separate microphone poor qualityhighly recommended if you don't rely voice chat gaming ( unless you play your closet )	1
this adaptor fantastic . we actually get better speed -- 115 mbps -- than what we get ethernet adaptor directly , which limited 100 mbps . it pick up signals least six houses away don't even show up my laptop , which intel 2200bg card . easy install even when switching new computer . our nine months old we're still very pleased . definitely good bang buck	1
i decided dust off my old technics direct drive turntable play some records family room kids . i connected it my system , rather high-end naim audio preamp amp kef speakers , it sounded just like you'd expect typical turntable would sound when mated high end audiophile type stereo system . i some research found shure cartridge ( m94 type purchased several years ago ) really didn't get very good reviews , so before buying new turntable i figured i'd try just upgrading cartridge . i chose this one because all rave reviews because reviewers went out their way say how bright " cd like " this cartridge made their records sound . this exactly what i wanted because my system already excels base midrange , i didn't need cartridge emphasizes what my system already good , but rather what it not so good . so i bought this cartridge carefully set it up according instructions . careful get overhang close you specs your turntable ! i washed off played old andrews sisters greatest hits record 70 . horns jumped out me old swing music just rocked my world ! difference this cartridge made like night day . now i've got cheap old turntable wired snooty high-end british system it actually sounding pretty good .	1
i wanted like this product . i really wanted like this product . but i am severely disappointed . when i purchased iaudio this past summer , i quickly learned my unit problems . when i moved mp3 file onto player , 85% time there would these weird skips electronic noise associated it . sometimes deleting reinstalling file helped . often it didn't . so i contacted their customer service , updated firmware instructed . problem still there . so i returned it cowon , they insisted player fine . i sincerely doubt random electronic noise feature , but once they say there isn't problem i don't know what else . so they sent it back me . i've tried it out again , problems remain . lark tonight , i looked them up better business bureau website . their rating . go figure . i would not recommend this product	1
i bought one , used only 2 days , then decided return it . turnaround time too long . reading speed well transfering data pc extremely low . not suffer it any more . return it . same time , i ordered cpen 20 . it much better than infoscan	-1

this unit works great . good buy money . i gave it 4 stars because my situation i use static ip addresses rather than dhcp dynamic addresses . unit intended users dhcp where your system obtains ip addresses auttomatically . there no written warning or instructions it won't work static ip addresses . i called linksys tech support tech very helpful . even though they no written documentation static ip , he knew how it he worked me through it ( which i wrote down all steps ) . most regular home computers use dhcp would no problems this	1

i picked up this receiver $200 plus $40 shipping . price it hard go wrong unless receiver just doesn't work . good thing receiver work works well . auto calibrate function excellent it kept me go through menu enter distances other characteristics speakers . just start calibration , walk out room come back few minutes . component video switching work well although consumer electronics companies ( sony particular ) made huge mess connectivity standards . there so many issues what works what anymore . too many connection types , drm , etc . i would really like plug any device into receiver send all video out tv . truth i can't plug s-video my dvd player composite my tivo into receiver it shown s-video my tv . everything input must s-video or composite but not combination two . but back receiver . it good number audio modes movies , music games . music doesn't sound very good me but could something my speakers . i set my small speakers " large " receiver so they would output more bass surrounds . i 250w sub but getting more low frequency sounds satellite speakers helps fill out midrange . this more issue small speakers than it receiver . i couldn't comment correctly audio performance unless i large set stereo speakers . i couldn't get any output pre-out jacks receiver . this disappointing because i specific use them mind . i also couldn't program remote my tv or dvd player . i fine this issue because i bought universal remote my entire system . one other issue i receiver i didn't like am/fm/xm all selected input same button . makes use universal remote much harder . i would rather button select fm input select xm . , i never know whether i'll getting am/fm or xm when i hit tuner button . i also remove analog audio inputs my dvd player order receiver use digital coax connection instead . i didn't expect receiver default worst audio connection available . overall , i'd recommend this receiver someone who looking buy one this price range . it good selection inputs , good sound performs expected	1

patrick miller " sauropod " already said it better but here take : . if you going buy receiver always go manufacturer web site , click support download owners manual . it tell you far more than amazon or any web site . i this jvc , sony , yamaha onkyo . . also decide if your real priority sound or if you really care video upconversion .. video upconversion really provinceof dvd player or tv . i not think it important receiver . . anyway my priority sound quality . tv boring me . manuals i downloaded all different receivers showed onkyo much more thorough technical specifications . others not , though they hiding something . also very noteworthy , if you take close look , this bottom line onkyo very similar amplifier specs top line model . it also vast majority sound processing modes . so this choice .. i tempted buy jvc because it only one five band eq unlike all others which only bass treble . jvc also more attractive functional remote control sound level each speaker without using onscreen menu . jvc also nice feature allowed usb connections computer . jvc would won if they better amp better speaker connectors back - they only ones used cheap push clamp connectors .. yamaha also good deal around $300 because it preamp out connections but it too seemed lacking .. i figured $200 today delivered this good deal money i saved i could use buy one new receivers hdmi 1.3 year when they relatively debugged ..	1
if your looking small necklace style mp3 player you cant go wrong iaudio t2 . i use it everyday work most time i dont even know i'm wearing it . it size makes it very unabtrusive no cables get tangled up . battery life decent 10-12 hours per charge . it its minor problems though . it sounds very good , but supplied headphones could better . thats also problem , if you use pair headphones you lose its necklace ability . navigating takes some getting used well . dont let negatives turn you off however . it very good product	1

i read some reviews this reason i'm writing this . i purchased two these units almost 3 years ago they operated flawlessly me . i them connect together no-delay feature there no gap music . soon song ends one cd deck song starts other . i 390 cd each unit . during christmas holidays they full , 400 each . reason i take christmas cd out sometimes i like play both units full random , all disc , shuffle . who wants christmas music all year long . both units operate advertised . so if you like me couldn't decide which cd put smaller cd changer ( i 5 disc changer ) , or though cd you wanted hear . now problem solved , i access 800 cd .	1

these speakers rate 5 stars ! very clear midrange treble . tight relatively deep bass . these speakers very good imaging sound ' dynamic ' . efficient so not lot volume needed make them play loud . speakers sound best ' loudness ' but require no other treble or bass adjustments . they listened least 1 hour per day . i am average hearing . speakers mounted stands which 4 feet off floor . these speakers receive my full endorsement great sound . bic dv62cls ( center speaker ) reported leading consumer magazine others whose opinion respected sound even better deeper bass but twice price	1
note : this copy review i posted red model this radio . old ( silver ) grundig/eton s-350 phased out .

these speakers produce terrific sound . they best bookshelf speakers i ever heard . sound projected through these speakers crystal clear . i hear same superior clarity volume 6 rooms away i hear when i'm right front speakers . this thanks highly developed bose direct/reflecting speaker technology . these speakers tend give impression surround sound home theater system . time after time my guests awe how much these speakers sound like top line large speaker system . these speakers produce such life-like sound people pass my house tend believe instead listening music , i recorded artist my home performing live . my only complaint bose 301 direct reflecting speakers subwoofers little weaker than i prefer . however this expected speaker such compact design . these speakers allow you listen your favorite songs whole new light . you read more bose 301 other bose products http://www.bose.co	1

i've using this mic couple years record round-table conferences , hearing room situations phone depositions - sometimes distances 15-20 feet or more ! only wear tear i've noticed sticky underside mic , which helps keep it place surface , partly torn off . not really problem . sound quality equal , if not better than , more expensive mics i , some costing over $a200 . added bonus labtec 333 no battery required , which means : ) you don't remember turn mic or off ; ) no fretting replacing batteries or not sure if they running low ; ) no unwanted feedback into some equipment , sometimes caused powered mics . pricewise , i personally don't think there better mic market .	1
i've this phone nearly year now , it hardly used , 3 hours per week most battery died both units . i replace batteries since it not usable all	1
i like look my macbook pro , so i keep it ( fairly ) clean am very careful it . however , keyboard one those problem areas hard clean , particularly notebook computer . i looked several more intrusive ( adhesive ) scratch-resistant solutions , but i found protouch best option me . because my main focus keeping system clean , i wanted able remove it , clean it off , put it back , while knowing whatever dust , gunk , etc ., it collecting wasn't getting into my keys . protouch works fabulously this purpose . silicone not quite transparent , but pretty good job letting macbook pro color shine through . some reviewers complained mbp keyboard difficult see cover some conditions . i no such problems , least far protouch concerned . mbp keyboard , because its keys designed allow light through , hard see low-light conditions -- this unavoidable , not really fault cover . remember clean it regularly , though , or oils such protouch transfer screen . it reversible good cleaning monitor , but still disappointing	1
i submitted review earlier ( follows ) . however , i've become very disappointed operation this unit . specifically , it stops showing remote temperature frequently . nothing wrong remote . i remedy problem removing one battery main unit , then replace it wait it correct itself . ** end edit ** original review follows still applies . rri installed unit just after denver christmas 2006 blizzard . i used standard batteries remote but still able read -11 deg . later , unit stopped transmitting ( see other person review ) . i replaced remote batteries it worked fine since then . i might go lithium batteries next time . real drawback , my view , smooth , curved display cover . it reflects light all directions makes it difficult read unless you move around or move very close . product would better flat display cover and/or etched cover ( reduce reflection )	1
i using this mouse work since it came out . after many miles use , scroll wheel finally started fail . i now spin wheel several times before screen actually scrolls . best feature this mouse battery life . coworker who swears his logitech mouse would change his batteries every couple months , but i usually got least ten months out mine . i even took dating batteries when i installed them , just rub it . this mouse bit heavy not slide well some , but overall i would recommend it . going try rechargable logitech next time around	1

i use this receiver couple months now , both stereo music home theather application . i am no fan surround systems all cable mass , but i wanted clear , powerful sound system when watching dvd satisfactory stereo music reproduction . i am really happy 3380 , it powerful , easy connect dynamic sound . i use harman kardon hd 755 cd player audio source harman kardon dvd 37 video source . i not advise use dvd player audio player , though hk presents dvd 37 dvd audio/video player high quality 24 bit 192 khz dacs , etc . when you play audio cd , sound cd player definetely better than harman kardon dvd 37 or samsung dvd player i . i am planning buy hd 970 cd player future upgrade . i just wish they used better connectors speaker cables , they look bit cheap , but hey , this receiver steal this price .	1

i've 2820 month now taken several trips , some where i've known route few where we charting new ground . most part street pilot performed well we got destination . however , when i used it guide me locations i'd previously it didn't always take me way i thought it should . eventually street pilot recaluated route would catch up way i going which during past travels i determined fastest way . regardless it performed very well . one case we tried program garmin location it didn't recognize , even though when we got there it all streets etc . provided acurate directions other locations spot . i e-mailed cartography department advised them what i saw they prompt responding solution when i programmed it , it got me location i looking . i noticed if your programming alternate route use cities data points route garmin wants take you center city you use data point . i'm sure there way program garmin so it doesn't , but i haven't time figure out exactly how level trip programming . if fact there isn't way you'll just get used hearing speaker continually say " recalculating route " . thats just minor annoyance benefit street pilot . sometime you may need search cities near where you want go get directions . i looking tierre verde florida , but needed type st. petersburg . regardless it worked cartography department quick respond . overall i'm impressed garmin my next purchase xm receiver manuver me around traffic tie ups . this product gets my recommendation .	1
i am returning it . bluetooth signal keeps fading out every 45 seconds or so . when it worked , it great , but not single song went without dead air problem 3-4 seconds then it would reconnect start playing again . i contacted logitech customer support they sent me email 3 days later suggetions completely different product . then i called long distance them stayed hold 14 minutes only told it sounded like it defective i should return it . not very satisfying customer service experience ; i high hopes this product ; i may order one later see if my luck any better then .	-1

this warranty purchased through amazon , but it actually distributed company . when you search tv warranties amazon , you see 4 warranties appear same , but different prices . i called company sells these warranties asked what difference . they told me there no difference $119 warranty $499 warranty ; they cover exact same thing . girl i spoke even asked her manager he said there no difference . warranties tricky item review , because it all looks good until you actually need it . so , this one , i suppose only time tell . one difference amazon warranty electronic store warranty amazon one not replace first bulb tv ; but i figure if i need replace bulb within those four years i still saving $100 because i get new bulb around $200 .	-1

my home theatre reasonable system any measure better than most . however , my wife re-arranged living room furniture one stroke my cherished system made redundant . my two rear wall mounted speakers now my left no possibility mounted somewhere else . it time look polk yamaha products . unable audition polk surroundbar yamaha ysp-1000 a/b comparison , i consequently decided purchase both , idea i would eventually keep one sell other . i now both units 10 weeks when doing my a/b comparisons , both systems set up so one speaker sitting just above other , playing same material instant a/b switching via remote control . note - it takes quite few readings instruction manuals eventually understand how set them both up properly . after comparing lord rings , pirates caribbean , pink floyd pulse variety cds music videos , my assessment : 1/ . both products produce satisfying sound field effective watching movies ( albeit very different ways ) . 2/ . my living room ( which pretty " live " ) my equipment polk , they both sound remarkably similar . this big surprise me . cds some music videos , most noticeable differences sound mostly due subwoofer performance . 3/ . either system produce effects equal 5 channel system discrete rear speakers ? course answer " no " . neither these systems produce rear surround effects distinct those generated rear surround speakers . but so many ways this question misses real point issues these products successfully address : 4/ . let me rephrase question : both systems produce big sound field envelopes you , similar what one might experience real cinema ? answer " yes " you hear convincing surround sound effects intended movie producers , immerse you into movie thus enhance your enjoyment ? once again answer " yes " . 5/ . if you want decent home theatre sound but cannot install multi-speaker surround system or you simply don't want , then these products solution work . 6/ . after reading forums net , i idea polk going sound better than ysp when it came music . actually cds etc , they both sound same , similar tone , both produce big sound , go loud each other ( very loud indeed ) . nothing distinguish one really better than other , assuming polk coupled quality surround amp sub . surprise here yamaha it myriad " tiny " 2 watt amplifiers comfortable really loud sound levels . 7/ . which better ? both plus minus points so it isn't clear cut . yamaha ysp-1000 matching yst-sw225b 150w subwoofer : -plus points : -+ guaranteed great sounding home theatre system . yamaha engineers made sure . + in-built power amplification ( this termed ' active ' speaker generally desirable configuration)+ decent pre-amplifier functionality eg volume control ( db level displayed ) , bass treble control , audio video input selection ( selectable 4 sources ) , auto-room equalisation , plenty surround sound modes , ir signal pass-through , remote control capable macros etc . fact ysp-1000 remarkable amount technology literally stuffed into it . + more effective producing distinct surround sound effects than polk , especially when set up it " ideal " configuration . ie centred against wall square room . + ysp effectively compensate corner position ( contrary notion ysp works well only when ideal environment)+ remote control other manufacturers products . + all you need extra dvd player tv . minus points : - requires side rear walls . - looks bulky industrial , my opinion not attractive addition any living room . - titanium colour ( more like dark grey ) not good match most silver big screen tvs . - remote bit frustrating times , too easy wrong control mode , eg you find yourself changing tv channels when you may intended change surround mode . - no hdmi input/output- cannot transcode composite component video signals . you committed all composite or all component input / output video signal pathway . ( not really problem if every device you connect ysp video inputs composite video out . )- on-screen menues only available composite video . so if you decide go all component video pathway best picture quality , you then lose your ysp on-screen menues . - no s-video inputs - probably impossible owner tell if any 40 speakers/amplifiers inside cabinet failed need replacing . - should dvd player built . polk surroundbar : -plus points : + looks great , visually complementing most big screen tv sets very nicely . + not require side rear walls your listening room . + similar yamaha respect it capability produce big , convincing sound field . + would make excellent choice " all-in-one " right/centre/left front speaker conventional surround system . minus points : -- requires investment 5 channel home theatre amplifier plus subwoofer- not guaranteed great sounding home theatre system . polk full potential could easily compromised `weak link " resulting poor choice ancillary equipment . - surround effects never really localised , rather you hear them originating hazy , general area , comapared yamaha which creates more convincing localisation effect . 8/ . conclusion : good looks - polk surroudbarfor rooms without side or rear walls - polk surroundbarfor square or rectangular rooms , even ysp corner - yamaha yspfor " most bang your dollar " - yamaha . ysp both sound good ( remarkably similar ) probably end up costing same set up once you add necessary ancilliary equipment polk . my particular situation i am trying rid my living room many boxes possible . consequently , if polk managed squeeze pre-amp power amp into their surroundbar charged accordingly , then polk would my first choice . it just looks much better than ysp unit . unfortunately they haven't , so yamaha stays i'm now selling off polk my existing denon amp , bw sub anthony gallo speakers	1
if you've seen this piece local stores you've probably heard they come assembled . well , amazon version requires assembly . while it wasn't too difficult or time consuming ( maybe two hours including disposal/organization packing materials ) , it would nice know it . aside assembly , quality look cabinet great . definitely worth sales tax savings get it through amazon - plus you get feeling accomplishment once you've put thing together	1

this single device could potentially everything i want .... if it all worked . ( rev ) . specs great which what made me buy it , but like most d-link hardware , it very poorly executed rushed market . major issues : 1 ) occasional ' freezing ' random disconnects several moments while browsing folders2 ) no option automatically boot back up after power failure3 ) upnp-av not sort alphabetically . this makes playing entire folder alphabetical ( or chronological ) order impossible . 4 ) tech support seems focused turning around emails ( albeit slowly ) , not doing any actual tech support . 5 ) extremely noisy fan ... i mean ridiculously noisy ! 6 ) no option edit email server port number email alerts7 ) overall poor quality , should lot more testing before released public . not bad price , but if you don't need all these features one device , look elsewhere	1
we bought this microphone facilitate recording meeting minutes . it works well conference room setting w/ say , 10 12 people . we connect it dell laptop microphone jack . using mid-boost built into sony mic helps lot . we also use free version audacity software record meeting directly computer . audacity allows you rip it . mp3 format directly long term archiving which very handy . it also makes it easy distribute minutes widely . product works well these conditions i'd recommend it	1

this television outstanding picture quality considering it price . you can't find better value than this tv this price range . my xbox 360 looks fantastic over vga . some older lcds you worry ghosting lag , but i not encountered any problems it . now complaints ... ready realize how bad standard def looks ! once you've seen things hd , you won't able look your grainy sd signals same again . also , channel changing bit laggy ( minor annoyance . ) menu also bit wonky difficulty navigate , but it it job fine . i would like few more controls over picture . i like you update bios via usb	1

i am not technophile , but after 8 weeks looking all options pricepoints , i knew much more than people retail stores . i first bought 46 " sony aquos it terrible variety reasons , most notably it really bad vertical horizontal banding , extent i started noticing flaw tvs wall retail stores - there simply no excuse kind thing leave factory . there other user-unfriendly issues too so aquos went back . i've this 6 weeks it great . swivel plus , though i disregarded my purchase . on-screen navigation friendly logical , puts controls your hands , versus some dynamic brightness default parameters aquos which bothersome . i haven't time figure everything out it yet , but it hooked up my 10 year old onkyo stereo , it all great ! amazon service delivery went fine . buddy mine analyst major bank followed amazon years , pushed me go ahead take leap big ticket item purchase . i am amazon fan until they cause me otherwise	1

first all , thanks amazon not listing dimensions this ... it 38mm deep , not 25mm like other 120mm antec fan my case . only reason i bought it cause i gift cards needed one , so i thought why not put antec fan my antec case . wrong , it waste my gift cards . it just too loud . i sonata case this loudest thing there ... it even hooked up psu fan controller power cords , which supplys minimal power . it just too expensive noise . dont even think connecting it regular 4-pin connector , i tried this it sounded like jet engine my room ! it probably woke up my neighbors	1
i bought this magellan 3000t took it still box vacation melbourne fl . i read directions plane it seened very easy set up . so i go set it up my rental car . i take out power cord it doesn't look right . side plug goes into magellan isn't round shape like it should . it shaped like trapezoid like end cable goes usb computer magellan . i accidently plugged it into usb port magellan . i'm lucky i didn't fry thing . well i called magellan customer service i spoke someone country ( outsourcing ) accent hard understand . i explained box came wrong charger . representitive hard time believing me . i read serial number charger cord her she placed me hold . she confirmed i received wrong cord . she said she would ups it me i would receive it 5-7 business days . i explained her i vacation needed use it now wanted it overnighted me . she refused . after getting rather firm her ( put it nicely ) , she put me hold again . she returned after 3 minutes said she would send it ups 2 day my hotel . i agreed would ok . well tuesday friday it still not there . i checked out hotel monday called customer service soon i got home . she gave me tracking number which indicated it delivered friday . i told her hotel sais they never received it . i called hotel again they checked again said they don't it . well magellan customer service tells me i sould track it down ups . i told her go track it down herself it would easier me return magellan place i bought it . just purely bad customer service . i lug this thing back forth couldn't even use it . i also got lost driving disney drove 40 minutes out my way . i am completely fed up magellan . i only gave it 2 stars instead 1 because maybe it would worked well if i could turned it , but i'll never know . well i ordered tip my igo charge magellan it works fine . price i paid ($250 ) i'll overlook my frustation say pretty nifty , if you don't mind paying extra few bucks charger . first time i tried update software program locked up . second time charm . i see others complain it not able play music function gps same time , who cares . i bought this so i won't get lost . i ipod listen music . why people so hung up electronics multi functional .	1

this 3rd gps unit i owned i am bit disappointed . first off , " intergrated traffic monitoring " means unit shipped garmins add-on gtm12 device . this device not integrated needs attached 370 operation . bluetooth integration useful , but volume quality built-in speaker not great , making it difficult hear callers . units detour feature also more limited than other units i owned . instance it not allow user view chosen route exclude road . you only able exclude road you currently driving . other than , maps fairly up date , poi database lot information screen pretty decent most light . finally , like most other units i used , it tendancy pick routes not optimal . example it may route you through middle city because it shortest distance ( mileage wise)to destination . this fails take into account multiple traffic lights inherent congestion add huge amount time trip could much quicker if route chosen . if you must nuvi , save your money buy 350 ... added features 370 not worth added cost	1
nano needs some kind case any other ipod prevent scratches wear tear . this case all . it comes stick screen protector you should put . this case durability security your nano its worth price . i got this case 6 months ago i havent taken it off since . only downside you take off case use it dock connector ... but thats it . it looks cool	1

this product would answer all my problems if it weren't few fatal flaws ; 1 ) it not support ' multifunction ' keyboards ... their technical support informed me this includes any keyboards include volume control , internet buttons , etc . you know , kind come most modern pcs sold today . i don't use those buttons keyboards cheap - i'd willing just buy new one except : 2 ) mice wheel buttons not supported ( according their tech support , this also constitutes ' multifunction ' device ) ... so if you gamer ( or just like wheel button ) , prepare replace your gaming mouse plain vanilla 2-button mouse . 3 ) their tech support pretty awful ; they seem checklist devices unsupported ( despite pretty standard most pcs market today ) , seem more interested finding reason why your configuration unsupported ( thus ending call ) than actually working you . my mouse working both pcs but just little choppy one , but once support person latched onto fact it wheel , they unwilling waste second talking what might causing problem if anything all could fix it . it too bad , it even slick looking little device . i give it two stars because it indeed switch back forth two monitors	1

first , i purchased my 276c september 04 which means i've using 3 months . it purchased replace my garmin gpsiii i used around 6 years . gpsiii still works great but no detail maps available no turn turn directions , but basic lat/long it still works perfect . i compared 276c garmin quest , magellan roadmate 700 , garmin street pilot series . i wanted it portable . meaning i could use it car , boat , or walking/hiking . basically i wanted able use it just anywhere , just like i used my gpsiii . this quickly narrowed my search down 276c quest . others mentioned above strictly automotive gps units . besides size , i couldn't find anything quest over 276c . 276c certainly bigger but i liked additional screen real-estate . 276c purchased automotive adapter everything i want it it well . however , i 3 complaints keep it getting perfect score my book . these not really any particular order importance . #1 proprietary memory stick only go up 256mbthis memory stick holds all map data helps you find addresses specific sites . one comes automotive kit only 128mb . you can't just go get one these anywhere because it proprietary design . 128mb one i enough storage download all map data austin , texas las vegas , nevada . we drove vegas austin november 276c worked great . i wish it wasn't proprietary design or i wish they least offered larger model would hold entire us . #2 cheap , cheap , cheap car adapter . i read this review site before i bought mine . they right . threading holds fuse place plastic . pulling unit out car power plug puts stress threads . mine broke last week but quickly replaced authorized garmin dealer . this item you can't just buy anywhere because car adapter built speaker . i don't expect new adapter last long either . i move mine cars several times week . #3 file this one under very picky . if address your destination one way street 276c try route you around block so you come back down one way street . this fine except when location really corner one way street entrance side street . unit literally route you right past side entrance next street allow you go up few blocks so you come right back down location one way street . i don't know if automotive only gps units would handle this situation any better . that it . we drove over 3000 miles our trip november used 276c extensively whole way . regards , alan	1

note : this copy review i posted wr-100b , which appears nearly same ( check both listings best price ) . i live oregon , which not noted severe storms , but i really caught " off guard " last week when severe thunderstorm large amount hail blew through . severe weather occur almost anywhere ! shortly after storm , i ordered one these weather alert radios keep me more aware any local hazard could pose threat . radio itself quite sensitive , provides reception several more distant weather stations not picked up less sensitive receivers such general purpose ( am/fm/tv/wx ) sony 410 ( see my review sony ) . big deal here weather alert function ... radio set silent until it receives specially coded message noaa weather station . radio programmed respond " codes " one area or several , so you adjust your " zone protection " suit your needs . when warning affects area you programmed ( setting specific same codes ) detected , loud alarm or flashing light or voice alert sound ( your choice ) . if it desired hear weather report , just push " weather " button unit listen ... very much like those old radio shack " weather cubes " very popular 20 years ago , but better reception . everyone should one ( or more ) these	1

i find it strange memorex dvd-rw reviews here favorable , while same time memorex dvd+rw reviews complain bad media . last year i bought memorex ram disk well memorex dvd-rw disks use my toshiba d-kr2 . i believe i only one bad disk out 10 or so i used . they lasted over full year through dozens dozens recordings eventually degraded , no complaints here time i probably would given them 4 stars . however i recently bought pack 5 memorex dvd-rw only 1 5 formated ( hence rating here ) . i also recently bought pack fuji ram disk first two i tried not work failed several tries formating . unfortunately , i bought these best buy which notarious their lack customer service they refused accept returns these . so , what going here ? why we letting these manufacturers get away selling products sometimes work some machines fail most time others ? where six sigma attitude when you need it ?	-1

grundig g1000a good beginner sw radio . it relatively cheaper than other grundig models , such e5 , e10 , e100 intended demographic lightweight , travel , light usage , and/or beginner sw radio . grundig g1000a wonderful overall simple figure out . you just chuck guide away , except shortwave section , you figure out all dials within 10 minutes , alarm time switches just like any standard alarm clock , use dial right frequency , one left volume . there connections left off switch ( which very tiny ) right . dials well placed good grip , making them easy turn . off switch easily accessible . it may little hard adapt if you've used previous radio different positions dials , but it isn't hard adjust . helpful alarm clock sleep option built . sleep option makes it possible so radio automatically turn off within set amount time 1 1:59 minutes . alarm turns radio , so you listen whatever . important : you must first disable alarm pressing alarm on/off switch then if you want turn off radio , then you . this neccesary because radio not turn off because alarm still " going off . " people just getting hang sw radio , there guide helpful sw frequencies per band it . audiolistic point view , speaker this radio not so great . if you really wanted get great sound , you would just get some good headphones or better speakers . but remember , you listening radio , which specially fit programs such bbc npr , which don't lot music or anything requires high quality speaker . i give it 4/5 because it not over top radio . it works just fine meets all my expectations , but personally , i use 5/5 something totally blew me away .	1

after thoroughly researching , i walked into circuit city expecting buy sony 26 " model kdl-26s2010 . however , after comparing 26 " kdl-26s2010 32 " kdl-32s2010 , 32 " model better value . consideration feature called wcg-ccfl described spec section . after side side comparison 32 " kdl-32s2010 ( no wcg-ccfl ) 32 " kdlv32xbr2 ( wcg-ccfl ) , wcg-ccfl produced noticeably superior picture , mainly due higher contrast ratio deeper blacks . i didn't mind paying slightly higher price improved picture . also , salesman suggested i compare sony comparable samsung several hundred dollars less expensive . samsung picture appear slightly better me , but sound little thin compared sony i also liked sony aesthetics much better . one other point others might find helpful ... i get cable service but they only offer 2 4 major networks hd . so , i purchased philips hd antenna(model phdtv3 ) apx $50 ab switch alternate cable air sources . after autoprogramming two sources separately , i now receive 17 hd stations over air ... free . switching cable air 3 step process involves selecting input or ab switch , selecting cable or air menu settings then selecting digital/analog remote control . this sounds little confusing , but it actually easy . worth effort i now view hd programming all 4 networks , 2 cable 2 over air ( not mention other 15 " air " hd channels ) . finally , i strongly suggest hooking up surround sound system so your ears just entertained your eyes .	1

system where i store backups archives failed . i needed some way access data 300gb drive there . not time or inclination troubleshoot system , so elected try nexstar lx external enclosure . use week now . installation - could not easier . manual comprehensive includes photos could better , but adequate . includes screenshots software setup explanation each screen . step-by-step good complete . nothing missed , nothing left question . space inside enclosure tight . but , there enough room install drive route cables . one photo illustrates exactly how fold data ribbon so it fits snugly neatly . functionality - good thing : includes usb 2.0 port so you use it like normal usb external drive . plugged it , powered it up ( ext power supply ) using ( good thing ) power switch . stood right up under winxp pro sp2 ntfs formatting . so i able grab critical backups data temporarily move them drive my system . beyond compare ( http://www.scootersoftware.com/)was great here . when complete , used tray icon remove drive power down . removed usb cable installed network cable . note : while powered down , i made point entering nexstar lx mac address my router mac address filter table . this not covered docs . so if you any peculiar network settings , like this , docs not address them . when i turned drive , i followed instructions open web browser page enter \\storage url address line . opened up login dialog box configuration pages . not really much here . i try exiting after i completed see if it would recognize ntfs formatting . it would not . so i re-enter nexstar config utility format drive . took couple seconds 300gb drive so guessing it " quick " reformat . i used included smb server screen create folders . again , could not easier . just experiment , i password protected one . still very easy . use - folders created i ready start using network copy/move files nexstar lx drive . i set up shares systems my network use folders nexstar . easy , worked very well . i used beyond compare copy files folders my internal drive over nexstar check everything " same " . i'm pretty much ready settle down normal use . fact i manually weekly backups work notebook last night it like using shared drive my desktop backups . folders recognized , backups moved swiftly everything worked advertised . notes - when i using usb connection , fan so loud , i sure i would need hearing protection same rooom it . i'd read this other reviews . i removed cover see if would help . it not . course , i move case around change usb network cables connection . after i , it whisper quiet . case plastic . i little leary this . but it sturdy not really " chintsy " . very nice finish ( i black case ) . i wonder if i not shift something around when i moved case unplug usb connect catv may rubbing fan . now it no louder than simpletech usb drive next it . if it continues perform it now , i'll very happy solution . addendum : 03 nov 06 - i originally wrote this 26 aug 06 . since then , nexstar lx performed flawlessly . , it very quiet . i left default setting let drive sleep when not use . so when i first access drive there momentary delay while it spins up . once it , it runs just fine . i am backing up several different categories files ( my shareware library , mp3s , images , etc ) almost every night week cobian . this combination i dreamt . i could not more pleased . i could not recommend it higher .	1

i'm not big writing reviews , but i certainly enjoy appreciate reading them , so i figure it only fair i give back bit . let me preface this review , saying i'm hardly videophile . i lot research before making this purchase spent lot time lurking avs forums , but before , no idea what black crush , mura , handshaking , clouding , stuck pixels , banding , etc . etc . let alone how identify them . personally , i happen think lot folks over avs perhaps too critical . my amateur eyes i , however , very satisfied set recommend it anyone looking high-quality , reasonably priced lcd ( kudos amazon once again offering great service basement prices ) . proscons excellent picture audio quality - rich , vibrant colors , good contrast sharpness . i used sound video disk callibration tool tv really seems nice job little tweaking factory settings . standard definition broadcasts , while they can't touch their hd brethren , more than adequate my purposes . we farily inexpensive polk surround sound system set up , but speakers tv sound pretty good themselves ! stylish looks - tv looks great living room comes useful stand those who arent interested wall mounting . intuitive onscreen menu remote interface - tweaking factory picture settings must , tv makes it pretty easy task so . i also bought logitech harmony 880 universal remote use most time now ( which i also recommend ) but included remote solid . i wish it buttons go directly source you want use ( hdmi1 , hdmi2 , etc . ) . only thing i don't like set - it more my setup than flaw tv - there glare fish tank our living room . lcds usually better than plasmas glare department but this one specific panel which gives screen pretty ' pop ' but also heightens reflections . it only noticeable me during dark scenes , but when i notice it , sometimes i trouble refocusing picture . also , set seem some trouble details dark images ( black crush i referenced earlier ) . over avs forums , there lot complaints hdmi handshaking problems where screen flicker or drop out every so often , but i haven't any issues . i've connected time warner hd-dvr box sa oppo upconverting dvd player ( recent amazon purchase which im satisfied ) using cheap hdmi cables ( yes , also purchased amazon - no wonder they just reported great quarter ! ) . i not however yet ps3 ( its wish list ! ) which seems where most handshaking problems coming . anyway , wrap up , i'm very pleased purchase . it great option those who looking lcd set around this size that future-proofed hdmi 1.3 1080p	1

this tv lot going it . nice looks , good picture . if you want replace 27 " tube tv , this set you , 4:3 image 27 " this set ( unstretched ) , you won't damage it watching black bars . course filling screen movies hdtv gorgeous . here some many positives : +strong digital tuner ( brings every digital channel la radioshack table top antenna pointed through multiple walls ! )+amazing hdtv picture digital tuner+many inputs means plenty options ( i mine hooked up my laptop via vga , my satellite via rca , hdtv antenna via coax)+satellite hooked up over 50 ' rca ( composite ) cable looks clean progressive dvd . means very good color decoder scaler . +good dvd upscaling , though i notice slight jaggies when compared hooking up computer set native resolution display letting computer scaling . considering how much more processing power computer , you can't fault tv . but if you htpc , dvds look their best played through . but there minuses : -red bias color decoder means you turn color setting down below optimal compensate . looks good , but could better . i may go into service menu see if this fixed manually . -horrible analog tuner . satellite sent over channel 3 , which looks great other tv sets , looks bad this set , but same picture sent via composite rca looks amazing . -fussy menus , could more logical , functional . -no direct input addressing . -no direct digital tv addressing . you must use auto setup , which time consuming , add channels it missed if you didn't your antenna pointed well . then you go back delete channels you don't want second time . -can't get black blacks without compressing darks . this typical lcd problem , though all companies claim fixed it . none seem yet . -smart stretch pretty " dumb " it noticeable spot where picture stretches . not fluid like panasonic smart stretch , course , some brands don't it all , but still could improved . after owning panasonic plasma setting up my sister panny plasma panny lcd projector , i know how smart stretch supposed look ... ;) -why remote so huge !!! why it so limited what it operate ? you program satellite tuners , example , but not directv or dishnetwork , two largest us providers . why some important buttons , like sleep , hidden behind door unlit ? light button doesn't glow dark , sleep button unlit . it if sharp doesn't understand why remote lit begin . -buttons top set means if you set top dresser or other tall piece furniture , you can't see buttons all . would better side set . but none those minuses worth looking elsewhere , sharp outclasses all others , especially this price . so buy this tv what it best , don't expect black blacks or good analog tuner , you'll happy	1

lc37d43u my second sharp aquos this year i say i cannot think any reason purchase any other brand lcd television . when i purchased other one ( 26 " )8 months ago i not hd yet only bought tv because physically it fit my needs so when i got hd boxes comcast last month it sort gradual transition . 37d purchased replace 32 " crt my basement . i prepared hd box getting rid damn coax cable plugging hdmi cable when tv arrived set it discovery hd channel . plugged tv into power strip , hit power button almost fell over how gorgeous picture . almost every other person reviewing lcd hd , i say sd tough look when switching hd channel , but 5 minutes after channel change picture standard channel still looks substantially better than crt ! i also want mention 6ms refresh rate . i know lot people don't put any credence this , but i see lot complaints ghosting reviews i read other ( mostly 8ms)lcd . i watched 20 minutes hockey game last night which substantially more fast paced than any football game you could watch it clear , vivid completely lacking any ghosting or weird imagery ! 6ms refresh rate ?? i'm no expert , but it seems like valid feature me ! pros : -2 hdmi inputs ( finally i take advantage this my dvd player)-easy use remote-default settings options any configurable criteria . mess around picture , volume or input settings make mistake ? hit reset button start over ... beautiful !! -sturdy constructioncons : -switching hd sd sd hd channels takes little longer than i would like image needs resize , but switching hd hd sd sd fast you would normally expect . this may normal , but i not see it 26 " . -the remote not any codes i could find control motorola cable box comcast hands out hd . ( if anyone out there knows fix this i would appreciate it)again , this my second sharp lcd 9 months i would recommend this brand this model anyone wanting solid , quality lcd tv !	1
i way too many tvs my home ( including two other samsungs ) but i needed small tv guest bedroom . our cable provider provides all local tv channels ( including all hdtv channels ) basic cable , clear -- without se t-t op box . catch , course , you need tv built-in atsc tuner recieve those channels . this one few small tvs i've seen atsc , although most it end year . setup incredibly easy - plug power , connect antenna ( or cable ) let tv its thing . my samsung found all available channels added them its memory 10 minutes . i am also impressed this tv flexibility -- it accept just any type input signal , including hdmi ( 3 ! inputs ) , component , good old composite video . picture quality very good , built-in speakers surprisingly good . i also like samsung new all-white case design . i older 23 " samsung ( also white ) my office , this set much nicer looking .	1

many radio fans familiar legendary grundig satellit line shortwave radios , dating early sixties ... e1 satellit 900 , even it advertised magazines 10 prototypes ... eton took over finally released it early august 2005 ... after satellit 800 mess , i wasn't expecting much , but after couple days ... its winner , just ordered second one sharper image they seem only one them ... here few observations ... e1 arrived almost hour ago , playing it ever since ... if you radio enthusiast , stop whatever you doing , order one before stores run out ... this one very special radio ... i now understand why pc two already ... whatever shortcomings eton marketing dept certainly made up engineering production depts ... most you already know " features " , so i'll comment my impressions things i've noticed ... - fit finish ... beautifully detailed , operating radio ... i see no fit finish issues all ! - sound ... full treble bass not distort sound normal listening levels ... would describe it " crisp punch " . - display ... awesome ! ( sorry jay , nothing compare this one ! ) . very clear bold dark readable digits evenly backlit light gray background , dark gray digits -- unlike tiny scrawny faded v21 digits . when off , there clock well over 1.5 " tall digits ... turning it puts tiny clock upper right corner , station number shrinks 3/4 " . i should mention there continuously variable contrast knob located under battery door ... station visible across room ! - tuning ... smooooooth tuning ( no notches ! :) depending band , 3 different " speeds " -- slower speeds add digits after decimal point , greater accuracy . - dx switch boosts 10db -- enough bring one my favorite low power big band fm stations ... really makes noticeable difference ! - all jacks left side except xm antenna jack which all itself right side ... interestingly , xm jack located what appears removable section radio two visible screws backside -- maybe future upgrades ??? - almost every feature some type adjustment via screens ... example , you adjust amount time snooze/sleep switch , well so many more features . i'm sure i discover much more tonite when i get more time play ... who knows what i find owner manual ( very clearly laid out i might add ) or dvd ... hardly wait xm antenna see what other tricks this radio up its sleeve ! ray	1

yes , you use ordinary mini-dv tapes this camcorder but there two good reasons paying more : 1 . video encoding format hdv cameras ( mpeg2-hd ) problems recording fast motion . this leads " drop-outs " but you reduce these using better tapes . 2 . different tapes different lubricants . if you use different tapes your camcorder , you end up jamming your tape transport . decide one product best suits your needs stick it . this tape special lubricant so it probably not good idea mix ' match it even other sony tapes	1
i bought this card my tj25 , supposedly supported device . but problems this card make it nearly useless : - it comes web browser doesn't work . - even if browser work , it would only work 30 days before you buy full version . - only downloadable browser works card eudora , which doesn't anything except display text ( you can't even fill web forms it , so webmail , searches , etc . impossible ) . - card designed work netfront clie mail , software comes internet-enabled clie devices ... obviously not what you would if you buying card . these programs not available separately . - card wouldn't connect either my wireless network or neighbors ' , even though my powerbook no trouble connecting either , no additional configuration required . - while attempting connect , card would often stop responding , then lock up handheld . bottom line : if you want web-enabled pda , buy web-enabled pda . don't buy this	-1

just received radio yesterday , am returning radio today ! pluses .... adequate lcd display good illumination while ac adapter . good thumbwheel tuning 1 khz increments . adequate speaker fidelity small radio . however , volume slew buttons set " numbered " volume levels , settings 5-6 , there big noticeable increase volume(not good ) , while tuning shortwave bands , every approx 100khz increment , there appears " null " area , where signal meter reads signal received , but quiet speaker . also , fm , if hands near radio , signal breaks up(for weaker signals , not strong ones ) , compared my grundig 400-pe , which i feel sensitivity not good hiss bothersome , eton e-5 seems worse still !!! i am returning this today , obtaining sony 7600gr instead . eton e-5 , not bad , but certainly not worth 3 stars or above , especially , if comparing it similar size radio , then comparing it my sony 2010 .	1

i wanted simple printer so i could print few prints time time hand out . sale $50 , this seemed like right one . i already included zoombrowser photo stitch software installed my prior purchase canon a95 camera , so i just needed install driver . note this requires usb cable ( not included ) printer . human nature , i tried print without reading zoombrowser instructions , got lovely plain sky-blue print words " my album " it - but no photo :-) then , out came stunning second print which totally blank but some faint horizontal lines - this residual click my first attempt . ok , ok , so i looked pdf printing guide 15 seconds , followed instructions . got beautiful first print queen mary ship . got gorgeous second print flags ( red/white/blue , green ) againt clear blue sky , third print very nice field flowers near mt lassen ( ironically original proof print this 20 years ago scanned onto my computer just today get rid paper prints ... ) so , i've blown through provided " trial " 5 sheets paper film cartridge , 3 very nice prints ( postcard address lines , stamp area canon logo back - paper comes way . ) ends paper remain white but perforations 1/2 inch end so you remove them after printing . i can't compare printing software any other brand , but setting up plain phot o-o nly print takes 10 seconds menu choices . if you want add backgounds , titles/text , etc , available well . ( got pack paper/film , put humorous captions kind funny-bad office christmas pix ... ) printing directly my a95 takes same time computer - 1 min 45 sec . actual operation involves paper passed out printer 4 times ( 3 color passes protective layer ) so it important back printer not obstructed , particularly power cord which hangs down near edge slot . finished print deposited top paper cassette front . unit looks feels substantial its small size , comes well packed ( survived ny ca shipping ) , decent documentation , 1-year warranty .	1

i gave my son garmin 60c christmas last year . tinkered it couple days before handing it over . it worked well . course i wanted one myself , but cash cash , so i've putting it off . ( side note - i wanted borrow it trip this past spring , when they went get it , it stolen their car map-pocket . it seems these high-theft items ; keep'em short leash . ) my wife hadn't gotten me any " big " christmas gift , so i told her i knew what i wanted , started shopping . i debated explorist 500 600 . chose 600 , its altimeter thermometer . probably could lived without them , but hey , it christmas ! it came yesterday , so i charged it bit , then it no trouble finding 4 satellites under my deciduous tree cover . i go out street garmin find satellites . took it out spin today . spot-on navigation i ran errands . it tracked back almost exact spot i marked home , though it me driving down wrong side street portion my route duplicate - so it off few feet . ( maybe it still thinks it britain ? )now - why only 4 stars ? 1 ) usb connector attach unit either way . there no instructions anywhere say which way it should go . i called 800 # spoke someone ( new delhi ) who heard this lot . she told me what , pc immediately recognized gps file system - removable disk drive , advertised . i really find their website information near-zero . something elementary this should covered website after 3rd call , eh ? 2 ) i bought mapsend 3d topo software . i am interested elevations . it detailed street maps . but - they're not routable ! if you want routable streets ( where unit route you streets not just crow flight direct path ) following car , then either you get both map products , or choose . it rather frustrating . sales information provided amazon magellan sites not make this critical lack very clear . it tells you what you , but not what you can't there no product comparison see what differences . mapsend topo box , it says very clearly , " navteq roads streets data - like found most expensive car navigation systems ( non-routable ) " . er , excuse me , then it not quite like found expensive car systems , it ? i concur other reviewers who find software selection verbiage ( amazon magellan ) more obfuscating than informative . why can't someone create simple comparison chart all various map packages	1
so far , so good ! only takes up 1u our rack . this product arrived good shape time . setup breeze . right now we only 2 servers connected it , but switching them no problem , so i don't foresee problem when we add 4 more . -kevi	1

when i got my hands pmc-120 i thought this going best player but when i started play it all glitches started come into my way . i agree other reviews it first generation-device feel it . music : when i tried put music my pmc it syncronized my mp3s wmp 10 no problem ( very fast ) . if u looking grab drop ( copy/paste ) your music mp3 device , this not you because when i it got everything one same folder read " unknown artist album " . so you put all your mp3s via wmp 10 , wich no problem me because it it very fast . problems i encountered it only one " portable playlist " sometimes when im playing mp3 navegating through other albums controls respond 1 2 seconds later after pushing button . one cool thing it shows cd covers without put them . this via wmp10 . sound very good crisp , equalizer setups fair . but you defenetly cant tell difference diffrent eq setups built speacker wich very small horrible sound . pictures : this basically grab drop procedure get your pics device you arrenge them folders or subfolders . you not transfer directly your camera so if you travelling dont pc transfer your pics this little baby wont job you . video : ok , now this where it starts get frustrating me ... i wanted portable media device i would only grab drop my movies divx xvid . i knew this device only reads wmv but it " supports " divx , xvid , mpeg , etc . this " support " deppends what wmp10 play . so this means you sincronyze ( via wmp10 ) your movies no matter format it converts them into wmp movies same time it just transferes it fits it into your pmc secreen size . i this mind when i bought it fine me untill i tried it first time : wmp10 wouldnt convert my xvid movies after few hours trial error surfing web my problem i correct video codecs compatibles wmp10 . so after uninstalling installing i good go so i converted 1:45 hr long movie only 25 minutes . but this short moment joy suddenly interrupted fact wmp10 fits widescreen movies into pmc makes all images long thin almost unwatchable !!!! you cant change this because wmp this automatically . my answer using other software converting my widescreen movies into wmv files . problem it takes almost running time movies convert ... i tried lot different softwares still havent found one it faster wmp10 . other hand if you full screen video you just use wmp10 it it very fast good quality . you connect your device tv but resolution very low so i think this option useless pmc . so veredict : pmc-120 good multimedia player minor glitches . it little bulky but personally i think size not big . i think good side size issue comes its big 3.6 inch screen wich great watch films this me kicks arse compared ipod video . if you want play directly your divx or xvid movies your player buy porduct like iriver pmp series or archos players wich way , way , way more expensive . so i think price what it pmc-120 gets two thumbs up .	1
very good player very reasonable price .	1

when i paid somewhere $20-$30 couple months ago optifix pro kit , i made wrongful assumption high price tag would entail good craftsmanship contrast some cheaper radial cleaners i've owned before . package description made it seem promising enough i've mostly good experiences memorex past , so i just put it test immediately after taking product home . after reading instruction guide carefully before use , i'm positive product used properly , but unfortunately , optifix pro just couldn't deliver goods . fact , not only could it nothing restore any discs i inserted , it worsened scratches it supposed repair ! what more frustrating - two discs it served further damage out print therefore irreplacable . i hope fellow cd collectors sympathize my message steer clear this particular memorex product	-1
appearances description , this appears identical my sddr-92 ( no a15 ) except shape button . this sandisk excellent unit - compact reasonably slim , detachable usb cord . it perfect carrying pocket your laptop case ( unlike my dazzle which fine desk top , but awkwardly shaped compact storage ) . unit reliable fast , , unlike 8-in-1 or 12-in-1 units which use up four hard-drive letters , this unit only uses one hard-drive letter . it supports reading , writing , deleting , etc ., works either usb 2.0 or usb 1.1 . if you not care button software , this unit installs plug-n-play , without needing driver cd ( least win 2000 xp ) . it simply appears removable hard-drive letter explorer . i not install button software because i am not fan extra transfer mechanisms photo organizers my computer . i would rather full , manual control how when things happen , where files put . i think this 5-star unit , but i downgrade my own unit 4 1/2 stars because its overzealous packaging arrogant installation instructions . both instructions , sticky label unit ( which i still not able fully remove ) , it proclaims you must install button software before connecting unit . i ignored warning , unit worked fine without any installation needed . one important requirements card reader portability . since not everyone takes kindly your installing software their computer , card must able work just plugging it into usb port . sandisk sddr-92 meets this requirement , although it proclaims not . this good choice compactflash reader/writer .	1

i noticed there several reviews various products here , but this review panasonic dmr-es10s ( silver ) . i am not technological wizard impatient , so my husband set this up me . i've it 5 months now love it . this tv upstairs . i bought it because i trouble our old rca dvd recorder ( unreliable ) , but that review . once setup it complete , unit very easy use . i read lots reviews before buying realized cons others not concern me , i.e. we don't hdtv yet so 16:9 ratio not important . all i needed something record things my tivo unit dvr could record multiple dvd formats ( dvd-r , +r , dvd ram , etc . ) . featues i like : i like ample space unit allows actually typing name show ( unlike rca which only let you few characters ) . i really use flexible recording feature exactly fit movie or fit lots shows . i play around this feature figure out how work it while recording multiple shows one disk ( manual wasn't useful part ) , but i use it all time . picture really good , even 6 hour recording time , which i use my decorating shows . change thumbnail feature also great . it allows you select what picture displays when you browse through programs . this wonderful feature important me , esp decorating shows , where i thumbnail feature room i like . after reading some reviews here it seems my unit lot cool features which would great someone who into electronics . i am basic girl , so i don't need lot bells whistles . i just need it what i want without any hassles without reading 400-page manual . my only quibble some buttons remote kind small , even my smaller female hands . rca i put tv downstairs starting mess up lot now , so i purchasing new unit . i've read reviews dmr-es20 , but since i am happy this unit i am going buy one	1

i 512 simpletech card , loved it . i got this 1gb card week ago it worked great . 512 card used very heavily nearly 2 years , so i purchased simpletech again . card maxs out meter which suggests how many pictures i remaining take , unless it highest setting . it says i fit roughly 950 pictures this 3.0 mp camera highest settings , but i not able take many yet ! batteries only last 300 pictures , so i probably don't need card this big . it nice videos though , it hold 15-20 minutes video 640x480 15fps . it also seems write very quickly . much quicker than my lexar card . most users , i would suggest 2x512 cards rather than 1x1gb . don't keep all your eggs 1 basket	1

power ups ! everything you need know . first all why you want power ups ? there some very good reasons . ( 1 ) you never want your machine go down incorrectly because blackout . ( 2 ) you want work clean power only . ( 3 ) you want monitor your pc power . ( 4 ) you want prevent your pc damaged due power problem like lighting strike want surge protection . first rule ups never trust insurance claim . get your pc insured elsewhere . these companies tendency not support their insurance claims . i pc running some very high specifications over six usb devices , lcd monitor , printer ethernet equipment , everything same time . i never gone above 325w usage average 250w 300w when managing high spec game doing lots background tasks . even though i 400w power supply unit ( psu ) i upgrading 500w psu because it better quality model . way i monitor how many watts i use ups software hardware . so question you need ask how many watts you using . short answer this you don't know until you install ups software tells you how many watts you use because appears only way you monitor your wattage this time . you need estimate what it . i would say high-end domestic pc ( not server ) would use 300w max if it one every device you think off turned . soon we add things like pc , or several printers , or several monitors , then we start overload 325w ups . this brings us first thing we need learn any ups - overloading balancing . overload feature warning system turns when you overloaded ups capacity . overloading two things . it theory eventually damage ups it voids warranty . most ups 325w but there 800w - 1000w even greater models out there home networks use more than one pc setup but honest you probably going get ups per pc setup rather than expensive bigger ups network . so check ups rating . what ups you choose depends how much you want load it . next thing you need check ups if it comes usb connection . if it this big plus because it means you control it your pc ups comes software . now if ups this feature then you loads stuff like turning off ups sound alarms , controlling how your ups handles blackout , how long it uses battery before shutdown or hibernation , if it sounds alarm or not , if it run self tests , data collection monitoring , notifications sensitivity settings . if ups not come usb connection software then you probably should looking ups designed computer use rather than ups non-computer equipment . most ups led indicators tell you status unit . next thing understand testing your ups not breaking it out box , connecting it mains , plugging your pc then turning off house power circuit breaker . you must charge ups first ! so read instructions . usually you must attach battery ups ( plug it firmly ! ) wait before using it . then perform test using software first ! then you consider trying simulate blackout your home see if pc stays up . usually ups programmed shutdown your pc if blackout lasts few seconds . nearly all ups models usb connection customized shutdown event or how long pc should hold ups battery . most ups devices allow you connect modem phone line into device then run phone line into your modem . this important because power surges ups not this protection damage pc through unprotected phone line running into modem usually runs pc somehow . this nasty problem degree security ups provide . if it doesn't this function then it not going provide 100% surge protection pc on-line . networking ups pc pc without ups also increase risk surge protection problems . it not recommend you network ups pc non-ups pc unless surge protection warranty not issue . one last thing some ups input regions ups surge protection other input regions not surge protected . also some models batteries need replaced after few years if you end up using them lot . this everything you need know ups before you choose one . it basically now downloading technical specs ups making sure it provides you what you need . two top brands apc belkin	1
you may well pitch instructions because they're worthless ( only reason i'm not giving 5-star rating ads tech video xpress ) . i ready pitch product well , after losing two evenings trying figure out how get it work . ultimately , i gave up relying solely program it came , i instead opted try it my windows movie maker . yahoo ! perseverance paid off ! once i switched movie maker , this tool worked great ! date , i've converted dozen videos content computer files i able burn dvds . i just leave my xpress hooked up back my television so i don't try remember later how hook it up again . doing , i connect my laptop xpress start video converting process within 3-4 minutes . my movie maker program takes over entire process . ads tech video xpress especially useful me because i teach college telecourse often show edited video clips my students . before purchasing xpress , i crudely edited videos i reluctant use ; my videos lots amateur stop/start points . using movie maker xpress , i able download these videos my laptop , then easily edit them so transitions stop start points became smooth seamless . pretty cool . i'm glad i took chance this product ! below hook-up program instructions i've written myself easy reference later . hopefully they'll more help you than instructions come this product : first , hook up video xpress equipment follows : 1 . s-cable ( buy one , since it doesn't come videoxpress ) goes back your television videoxpress . 2 . use red/white/yellow cords running into back vcr/dvd hooked up your televion follows : - all three plug into " video out " column- all three plug into videoxpress tool other end . 3 . usb plug videoxpress tool plugs into back computer . next , open instant video xpress program verify settings follows : - " ntsc " video standard setting- " 640 480 " " 60 fps ( vga ) " video format- " dvd , vcr , tv " video source- " video composite " video inputunder program advanced settings : - low motion ( tv , vcd , dvd)- cpu support : " sse3 " - stereo system : " mts " - video decoder : " video standard : ntsc_m " under properties within program advanced settings : - stream format : video format : " ntsc_m " - frame rate : " 59.940 " - color space/compression : " yuy2 " - outputs size : " 640x480 " finally , close instant video xpress program .

i this exact iriver when i loaned it out , it got lost . so he offered replace it even " better " mp3 player would show photos , etc . i asked exact replacement because i love everything this mp3 player , it fits my needs perfectly . features i love it both voice radio record you also record your stereo or cassette or whatever audio source using line-in feature . it tons space more than i've ever used , small size sound quality great ! i seen some people write they didn't like buttons or problems turning it off accidentally , but i personally never problem , long i slide hold button over lock position . i like it gives cord hang it around my neck , or put it my arm .. however i rarely use armband . only reason i gave 4 stars instead 5 because you cannot view photos it , even tho you store transfer them . i personally don't need feature , but others may prefer it . i love my iriver	1

labels sticky one side , printable other , but that all this product going it . software nightmare . print previews only vaguely represent finished product , program frequently randomly alters your image . i wound up using labels , but creating documents ms publisher . what shame	-1

after reading some previous reviews , i wanted state this player definitely plays back multichannel dvd-audio discs . if you're only hearing sound out 2 speakers , then there must setting you need change setup menu . also , i've burned many dvd-r various dvd burners ( not panasonic branded ) they've all played back flawlessly this panasonic dvd-f87s player . haven't any problems this player i've owned it 18 months now .	1

i've read other reviews this product people complaining losing their data when batteries changed . this not true if you're carefull . first all , my ebookman came bright blue warning flier stating your ebookman needs turned off when you change batteries . pretty simple , huh ? also , don't wait your battery completely die before you change it . main menu screen battery meter bottom right hand corner , i just switch out batteries when meter reaches 10% . i primarily use my ebookman read ebooks i love it	1
i work small business we can't afford risks data theft . this unit put my mind ease , especially since i work very sensitive data . if you love gadgets , this extremely cool product . its sleek within seconds destroys your data . its very compact heavy duty , so its durable easily fit home office , well any place work . you just insert disc within seconds thousand tiny imprints made both sides disc making disc unreadable . this great product because it securely destroys data without shred disc shattered broken pieces plastic everywhere . anyone who owned or operated disc shredder , they very messy . this excellent alternative . so quick easy use , anyone operate it . this should household requirement , much any other appliance your home . i received my norazza data destroyer within couple days placing my order which very fast service . i strongly recommend this product personal well business use !!!	1

hardware breeze install . took 20 minuets including bay . same software , no problems . sound quality much improved over my old live card . battlefield 2 game play much improved my 2.4 /radeon 9700 pro/512 . before i would freeze framing during start rooms , during game play intense situations . now x-fi i none , game runs much smoother overall . dvd movies sound much improved . music also much improved . only problem ive burning expanded mp3 1 didnt convert well out 5 so far . software interface also bit lack luster , but functional . card worth price , hopefully upgrades improve interface .	1
costco here too . 180 great price , but hissing become annoying . it sound like larger capacitor .... its constant ... constant . i hear it walking through room passing within 8-10 feet unit . noise dissapears when tray open , only . i really like it , but hiss getting me . i notice its sale here $129 . maybe ill shop around , spend bit more	1

i've logitech g15 several months now it many features which i use regularly . paint doesn't seem wear off even if i rub or scratch keys . installation somewhat time consuming because keyboard drivers each part rather than one driver entire thing . pros- lights look great screen easily readable third party lcd apps highly customizable i use chat trillian access my buddy list screen . ( keystrokes go directly screen when you hit button reply , then i send it hitting enter ) i view winamp visualization song title , view my playlist , change various volume controls use standard playback functions i view network activity macros easy program key feel awesome compared my old keyboard . they nice solid click them , but pressure necessary keystroke length both small . cons- included lcd apps terrible useless me long setup more g-keys than you'll ever use minimal game support lcd apps take up valuable ram ( although not much ) keyboard profiler takes up ram must run maintain full functionality invisible lettering when lights off light brightness levels pointless . options : off-can't see it ! 1-visable but dim . 2-slightly more visible but still dim . usb ports usb 1.1 " gaming mode switch " ... i never hit windows key while gaming even though i usually use ctrl alt frequently . i think you'd really fumbling keys need feature wrist rest flimsy default lcd setting cycle through apps ( which i hate ) if i don't shut down properly , lcd profiler resets all its settings default . included pop3 checker doesn't ssl , you need get some ridiculous add which sucks up more resources . mail checker app+ ssl thing ends up little too resource heavy me appreciate . other words , its big pain get gmail working included checker . if you play lot world warcraft or really like tweak your settings streamline your interface , you might enjoy all macros . screen more useful non-gaming purposes , so don't buy it intent improve your hl2 experience ( since lcd doesn't display anything hl2 anyway ) . there many 3rd party lcd apps out there you probably find one make you love screen . warned , unless you use 3rd party apps , you probably disappointed lcd functionality . bottom line- recently priced spiked up these keyboards , i wouldn't pay new higher price one . this isn't kind item i would say i can't live without . its mainly luxury , unless you're serious computer geek ( like myself ) , you probably won't even know how utilize more advanced features . hardware solid powerful if you know how use it . included software cd ended up my trash .	1

this excellent machine . i bought two them . there few things you need . i 100% satisfaction using fujifilm dvd-r up 8x . i success fujifilm dvd+r up 8x . i`ve also tremendous success tdk dvd+r up 4x 8x . some other brands may not work . one thing i`ve learned this machine you baby it little . don`t go recording 3 or 4 -r or +r dvds every day . give it rest recordings . one or two per day okay . definitely give it room breathe . if you stack your machines top each other , put something so they breathe . sure not block ventilation holes sides . you definitely need buy panasonic dvd player play back your dvds - other brand dvd players may not play your recordings properly . one greatest things this machine it records dvd-ram . they re-recordable many , many times each program erased when watched . you even edit recordings dvd-ram . cut out commercials fit more disc or remove commercials when you watch program . only works dvd-ram . i over 50 dvd-ram discs ( panasonic brand ) - they sure take up less space than vcr tapes ! get one or two these recorders panasonic dvd player you`ve got it made ! throw away your vcrs forever ! just remember baby them	1

we bought this printer go canon g2 we bought . excellent choice . first i must say if you considering buying it anyone other than amazon [ . com ] , don't . i dealt amazon [ . com ] years they best what they , no one comes close . printer so easy setup , not like some other printers . we using window xp , it went like breeze.in lees than 30 minutes i printing pictures .... i am still learning all features , but quality pictuers good if not better than any other .. it fast fast , printed 2 4x6 pictures less than 4 minutes , i found you need buy quality paper . i used canon 4x6 bordless paper first until i ran out , then i switched brand , big mistake . use right paper you amazed	1

i trying find way easily carry lot camera equipment quite some time . i tried backpacks , shoulder bags , duffel bags , but none them really worked all well . then i saw lowepro street field system completely customizable pouches , vests , belts , accessories . it works great , you only get pouches you need so there no waisted space you organize them however you want according how often they used ( put frequently used items easier access places . ) variety alone this system worth investment , but quality ease use also very high which big plus . you get case any lens , camera body , or accessory you . i even cases my cell phone water bottle . one word caution , sure measure your lens lens hood backwards if you use them make sure entire thing fit into pouch , because sometimes lens fit , but then lens lens hood not . i often carry 5-6 lenses , extension tubes , teleconverters , extra memory cards batteries , bunch cleaning supplies other gadgets , which weights ton . but when they evenly distributed this vest/belt lowepro system it actually very manageable . only down side everyone staring you because you thousands dollars camera equipment strapped your body . but if you overlook , this way go . i used this system many zoos without ever problems , fact just unzipping single lens switching seems safer me than opening entire bag equipment every time you want switch lenses . many cases also come built rain/snow cover so if weather changes all your equipment not destroyed . you also put just few pouches normal belt when you just going take photos back yard or don't need take all your equipment , which nice . i really can't say enough how much easier this makes traveling lot equipment , if you hopelessly searching better solution , consider this , you won't regret it .	1
it really cheap , cheapes around . also it works fine , no complaints . but it looks little weird , packaging sticker card . maybe nock off ? since it says made china , but it works none less .	1
i used this mouse 3 months my laptop . look/feel general use fine short periods time ( ~ lt ; 1 hour ) . however , i am currently shopping replacement this mouse one problem : intermittently , after clicking/double-clicking , mouse go into " move left " mode ... continue move until it reaches edge screen . sometimes it move upper-left . this so inconsistent unpredictable . i often ( least 10 times 30 minute period ) give mouse wiggle stop it continuing . frustrating if you trying click through multi-level menu , instance . example if you working any cad-type or image editing project where you need insert line one segement time ( mouse move when it feels like it ) . it ok while , but now it annoying ... going buy replacement . if i buy replacement product because how product performs early stage its life , it gets no more than 2 stars . it could just this one particular mouse , but then points lack qa manufacturer end ... again , 2 stars	1

if you want budget home theater system under $200 there probably not many systems better then sony ht-ddw700 . this system ideal small rooms such bed room or tiny living room . considering price , sound quality actually better then expected me . tiny cube speakers presents pretty good clarity . they may look like cheap computer speakers but they aren't bit heavier then they look . center channel may little underpowered since dialog during dvd movies sound tad soft little too low . surround effects during movies dolby digital dts very good though . if set up properly speakers handle surround effects very well . some minor complaints speaker wire attached speakers very thin . they fixed can't replaced . also , if you want heart stopping bass then this system might not you . 8 " subwoofer okay considering price system . it currently better then any other sub included home theater system under $200 . it isn't powered , very light ( only 9 lbs ) you pretty close actually feel bass . volume would cranked up extremely high sub actually rattle your walls . receiver comes 1 optical 1 coxial digital input 4 rca analog inputs . it should enough most cases . extra digtal input or two wouldn't hurt but again system under $200 . setup couldn't easier . you just hook up included microphone , place it your listening postion press button remote . system automatically sets up speaker distance , delay volume levels . receiver comes basic pro logic ii music move modes upmix your stereo sources . it also other sound fields effects enhace sound but they don't really seem enhance sound much if all . basically , if you want home theater system small room under $200 then there isn't much better then sony ht-ddw70	1
caselogic set standard media storage , this continues tradition . few tweaks needed , however . i am certain i soon fill 20 slots . therefore , it would helpful clear plastic sleeve spine inserting title or index avoid open each case search specific disk . graphics sleeves small enough considerable trimming original case graphics needed . actually , i would prefer dvd companies would make their graphics more easily adaptable album rather than other way around	1

there not really lot say this product - it protects your nano , material good quality , it not too thick ( doesn't bulk up nano too much ) not too thin ( provides enough protection ) . i wanted this go jogging my ipod - it fills function perfectly , strap comfortable . only flaw i found ( this not bother me , but i know it might bother others - hence 4 instead 5 stars ) , material act bit dust collector - if you put it dusty packet , it collect lot dust .	1

i bought blue logger both street atlas 2005 sa2005 hh my dell x50v . no problem blue logger gps but my complaints follows : 1 . delorme not include blue logger manager software hh . now they want sell it separately additional $39 . very weird marketing strategy indeed . 2 . software pocket pc very difficult use , not very intuitive . it seems hand held software developed afterthought software pc . it poorly designed , appeared not fully tested normal users prior releasing market . 3 . it very cumbersome slow determine route . even 620 mhz axim , it slow . worse yet , route often wrong . example , this afternoon i use sa2005 determine route friend house . i followed route , i would come dead end street back track 10 miles get correct route my destination . luckily , i decided use my paper map . later , i tried microsoft mapping internet it actually gave me correct routing . last week location , sa2005 found wrong location given address which would take me 4 miles off . luckily , i knew where it ignored routing sa2005 hh . 4 . many other mapping softwares hh allow one use it 1 hand often finger . but not sa2005 hh . after 2 weeks using it , i found myself going back my old paper map . example , if i not calculated route just simply use gps map travel , software only show street i but no name given no street name shown upcoming cross streets . it not help when you lost . 5 . sa2005 maps seems several years old not very up date . i guess that why delorme not want clearly advertise this issue . i am seriously considering giving up sa2005 consider this my $50 learning mistake , looking microsoft street trip 2005 or later 1q 2005 , iguidance who supposed latest map . i am not alone this several other users also complained delorme user forum . i wish i read forum before buying delorme software . well , live learn .	1

i am audio quality freak ! i love flac ape , 64-bit decoding , cowon jet audio sound re-production over windows media player any day week . i picked this up evil blue yellow box store town , i'm blown away . i never found sound card i extremely happy sound reproduction through headphones until now . generic c-media drivers xp/vista work best , no need equalize or install turtle beach drivers . using set panasonic rp-ht355 headphones , ( course , i bypassed potentiometer headphones because they all add resistance ) this sound absolutely breathtaking . read review these headphones if you looking great sound budge t.t he only other device put out this sound quality my alesis multi-mix firewire sound mixer . but this pro-audio device , it $300 unit ! volume 15% - 20% , loudness option checked advanced properties , this usb sound card more than reproduce enough sound through headphones make it feel like your studio artist performing . works great native vista drivers too ! far negative reviews go , they probably bad headphones , or received bad unit , there no way this device puts out anything but crystal clear sound . i make sure no windows sounds using device primary sound driver , keep all little clicks windows navigation sounds out , set jet-audio direct sound output this card when available . hot swap great xp vista beta2 . i've used these same headphones ... creative sb live 5.1 , audigy ls , soundmax integrated hd audio ( asus a8r-mvp crossfire onboard audio ) , alesis multimix firewire 8 sound cards . only sound card i would say sounds equal or better alesis . buy this - you not sorry	1

i got this my razr v3xx . i haven't put too much it yet , but once i get my stereo bluetooth headset , i plan load up disk use phone alternate mp3 player . one thing i've problem - it not easy get disk out adapter . first time i tried , i began wonder if it wasn't stuck there good , but eventually it came out . it goes out phone slot much easier . since i usb cable connects phone computer , i just might leave disk phone not mess it . while 2 gb capacity seems like lot today , wait few years . then we'll probably wondering how we ever survived mere 2 gb	1

i've sc101 almost year . when it works , it super . when it doesn't , support poor you really your own . i've three different issues affecting data three different machines accessing it over past months . none issues discussed troubleshooting guide , nor faq , email tech support completely unhelpful . i've able salvage my data each time ( yes , ultimately i it backed up could recover if needed ) , but stability support device makes it impossible me recommend it anyone who feels they average home user . ( i am fairly technical user never this kind trouble pc product .	1
i now own three different pairs clip-on earphones : koss , altec-lansing , sony . sony best , these reasons : 1 . they position speaker so it facing forward rather than towards center your head . this way , you get direct sound your eardrum , consequently sound louder ( saves your batteries ) , you get better high-frequency response ( sound doesn't turn corner get your eardrum ) . it just sounds better than others . 2 . stiff plastic design ( no moving parts ) makes them very easy get off , easy tell left right . they don't move around once they your ears . 3 . cord sliding part which allows you secure wires up under your chin , effectively giving you single wire your neck sound source . handy keeping wires out your zippers collar , , i think , handy running , keep everything secure . 4 . no foam irritate your ear distance your eardrum sound . too bad they orange . but orange almost fleshtone , so it isn't too bad ( white guy ) . other clip-on might look niftier ( altecs some chrome which looks way cool ) , but they don't work well . these great clip-ons . just buy them . this price , i'll buy second pair .	1
i'd read reviews amazon elsewhere , therefore knew what expect . product good price , expected . speaker wires too thin . physical set up easy but tuning speakers not . upscaling 1080i very impressive using hdmi ; haven't tried component . remote control easy use but not always intuitive ( how i turn off subtitles without punching multiple buttons ? ) . works well my samsung dlp 1080p . packaging downright unacceptable . box styrofoam packaging too thin . dvd player/receiver placed box top everything else , little protection its wide ( 17 " x18 " ) top . box damaged dvd player dent it causes tray grate stick . brings me return/refund policy . amazon amazing customer service - very prompt , polite , professional , etc . however , they're not able replace just dvd player/receiver unit . entire system replaced i.e. entire 60lb+ package travel back forth . now it turns out they're out stock this product therefore only able offer refunds , price-match when it come back stock . that good hear but still means entire system repacked , shipped back them , get refund then wait without system till they're able ship one out . i understand how they'd see this equitable them customer but it too cumbersome	1
i've used kit it works well , especially outlets overseas 220/240 volt systems . one complaint archos requires one purchase so many extras when basic one like ac charger should included original 504/604 together usb port charger . my second problem ac adapter still takes long time charge archos battery - almost long usb port . said , i'm glad i bought it or i could not charged my archos easily	1
fantastic portable gps unit . crystal clear , bright , wide screen display best market . current leg directions displayed band across top screen ( like other nuvis ) white letters green background ... reminiscent big interstate signs ... nice touch . built-in speaker loud clear enough i haven't even considered using fm transmitter , although you certainly . very fast route recalculation . low profile , super adherent , windshield mount excellent . i going look into other mounts , but discovered its great when mounted low , center windshield . this almost makes it seem like its mounted dashboard . 660 wide screen conceals mount completely , so you don't even see it . ok , 660 bit pricey , but why settle something you may not satisfied ? it .... now	1
this clock just what i looking . only thing i would wanted stereo speakers . but other one i looking ( boston ) really didn't enough bells whistles sound much bassy . i find it hard see clock compared others	1
i clock week , i ordered two more like it . i tried digital wall clock because i couldn't stand ticking mechanical clocks hands . digits this clock clear . radio-synchronization works perfectly . i recently compared it greenwich time using internet , it second . there some weak points . instruction booklet very small type . reading glasses handy . display needs certain amount light able read it wider angles . radio synchronization didn't kick until morning after i set it , but working fine ever since . clock also looks nice . all all , it serves its function very well	1
very comfortable use but exceedingly odiferous coming out plastic sleeve . better after exposed air several days	1
i bought these my dvd player . they work wonderfully ! old analog cables came dvd player looked alright but [ didn't measure up } . these monster cables definately enhance sound my dvd movies , especially dialogue . old cables i made my movies sound bit muffled . but monster cables intensified clarity dvd player my reciever . those us who cannot afford 5 speaker digital surround sound , i would definately recommend these cables if you use regular 2 channel stereo your movies or cds	1
i ordered this mistake- i used them anyway- i just say i've gotten better batteries dollar store- dont waste you hard earned money	-1
item doesn't work properly . video quality okay . there loud background static type noise both tv computer video card when i attempted record show . background noise makes product useless	-1
i mounted these my ceiling just behind my sofa . i intended these just rear channel speakers , but i they sounded good enough i am sending my stereo through them now . installation simple i them out box playing music under 20 minutes . biggest hassel cutting hole trying avoid insulation ! i am considering buying pair put back patio would recommend these even my best friends	1
amazing product , right out box . i would write more but i'm watching penn teller bs ! it right now	1
these affordable , great-sounding monitors , ideal beginning home studio budget . first pair i bought disturbing problems : one channel not functioning , volume button improperly attached , so it recessed into cabinet , i almost went refund rather than exchange , but i patient , amazon sent new pair immediately . i'm happy them . i'm singer songwriter , they're perfect what i . you get what you're paying here : dubious manufacturing quality , but great sound . we'll see how they hold up .	1
i knew it smaller than standard sd card , but i shocked see how tiny it actually when i first opened package . i am using this my lg chocolate phone store photos music . it works great . it comes sd adapter card so you use it standard sd slot . very useful transferring data onto card since most pcs not support micro sd	1
t've using panasonic dvd ram over two years cannot imagine not it . i installed lg4082 my pc because it reads all formats albeit verrrrrrry slowwwwwly . i make dvds pc play them my tv if i choose vise versa . you use ram second hard drive . record your imformation then edit it way you want it ; transfer it h.d. , then transfer finished data permanent -r disc . i used record whole week one hour shows then weekend edit out chaff file main points . programs late lamented " call help " " screensavers " late lamented techtv channel . i also use ram disc record everything i watch case i miss something want replay . who needs tivo ? i tried r/w system but it just seems little too finicky me . i 10 r/w discs now i 8 r/w coasters . r/w bad habit finalizing disc even if your recording fails some reason you end up blank disc your recorder thinks full or non recordable . i think i'll stick dvd ram now , it winner	1
i two subwoofers home theater system . my sw200s saved subwoofers three times ( while giving up their lives ) . first time after large ice storm ( feb 03 ) . second time aftermath hurricane ( isabel ) . third time after small ice storm accompanied high winds ( feb 05 ) . each time power conked out came back ( big surge )	1
price , these headphones surprisingly good all respects except sound quality . although i'm not qualified give critical audio review ( but nobody who qualified would review these ) , i think most people would agree me their frequency response goes fairly low , but they excessive middle/upper bass peak . high end doesn't seem go high advertised ( i didn't notice any " air " ) , there seems pronounced peak range corresponding cymbals vocal sibiliance . when listening popular radio ( which i get variety source material ) , which boosts these same bands , combination nauseating . i hoping they'd flatten out after breaking couple days , although bass got deeper cleaner , low-end peak remained , high end didn't improve . they reproduce simple sounds quite nicely , but complex passages become blur . but then , phones everything well probably cost five times much , or more . it would interesting see what philips could twice price . i experimented reversing absolute polarity ( which required chopping off connector reconnecting " hots " " grounds " " grounds " " hots " ) , but sound got worse , so it already optimal my system , unfortunately . instead in-line volume control , which seems useless this day remotely-controlled volume , philips should provide in-line absolute-polarity switch . fact , all headphones should such control ( some grado phones them ) . correct polarity isn't always immediately apparent untrained ear , so give yourself some time ( possibly weeks typical listening ) , keep open mind . you'll eventually find you prefer one polarity over other . i reversed polarity speakers dirt-cheap tv , sound improved considerably , so it help even most basic sound system . it also possible polarity change source source . some high-end preamps ( such some audio research ) absolute polarity control compensate such differences . it probably good idea turn volume down or mute preamp before " flipping " polarity avoid possibility blowing out anything down line , although i wouldn't surprised if ar polarity control automatically mutes preamp before reversing polarity . some disc players also such control , because it cheap easy digital realm . summary , i would say these headphones great deal unless you need something critical listening or popular radio .	1
i got chance borrow friend mine go 910 i highly recommend it people looking get gps their car . i didn't need any instructions it easiest thing use(and i'm no tech genious !!! ) . i think it updated latest maps it took me exactly where i needed go -- no problems . i no complaints this product am now looking purchase one myself !!!	1

i am air force trained techie over 15 years . i lot experience computers electronics . after lot research i went hollux gpslim236 . initially i very pleased device until it started problems . first it would never lock satellites . ( yellow light stayed ) i found out unit went into sirf protocol mode . i find program called sirf demo get it out sirf protocol placed it into usable protocol nmea . next device started problems blue tooth connection . ( blue light would never turn ) . i would turn device off 50 times before magic blue light would turn , then sometimes it would only turn constant not blink . i could bypass 40 times turning it off bouncing device off my steering wheel . this ridiculous thing get it work . i emailed tech support tried call them all no response . now it most finicky device i ever . i am often tempted throw this piece junk out window it . i must strongly recommend you stay away this device probably hollux all together . now i buy gps	-1

needed fast aa charger charge up nimh batteries my camera flash unit , bit shopping research . found this unit decided give it try . comes 6 aa 2 aaa , so they get you started right off few batteries use , which nice . unpacked everything ( plastic package difficult open up , so careful ) plugged it . there cooling fan built which moves air across batteries during charging , so just make sure you don't rest charger where airflow blocked ( e.g. carpet ) . within stated 15 minutes , batteries tested out 1.2 volts my voltmeter . put batteries my flash took several dozen pictures night without any problems . yet really give them extreme durability test , but overall seems like it working fine so far . some additional comments - if you're looking buy this charger charge existing nimh batteries you may already own , aware charger some " intelligence " - , if battery " bad " , charger not charge these batteries . light turn , then start flashing indicating there problem batteries not charging . out 4 existing older nimh batteries i own , only 2 them charged this charger . i suspect brand new batteries not this problem . it charged my old batteries also within 15 minutes , these old batts tested out 1.2 volts again my voltmeter . based this trial , it not appear you need use ic3 batteries get ~ 15 minute charge times . package not indicate this requirement , either . i note other competing chargers market only give you 15 min charge times if you use special ic3 batteries . non-ic3 batts supposedly give you 30+ min charge times . not so this charger , my experience so far . nowhere package it tell you what input voltages charger supports , so i flipped it over read label unit . it requires 100 120 volt input , so if you plan using this overseas , you should bring voltage converter you . us voltage input only . unit little bulky , so if you going vacation , you'll probably pack it your luggage , not your camera case ( my existing 14 hour overnight charger small enough toted my camera case today ) . it comes cable plug into wall socket or adapter car use . instructions say if you charge batteries car , it take longer than 15 minutes . i not tried this yet don't know exactly how long it take . overall , i am happy purchase would recommend this unit anyone looking turn aa charge times around quickly , particularly any professional photographers who use these their external flash units	1
sure , there may other racks put looks over function , but if you need deep shelves large openings your phat gear , this value buy . i bought this thing house my home theater gear 200 cd changer . cd changer alone 19 inches deep 7 inches tall just won't fit into fancy stand sporting wire blind or shabby 4-6 inch shelf spacing . av receiver pretty big , too ... almost big changer -- it gets pretty hot boot . open rack design keeps air flowing helps prevent any meltdowns . so , if you " real " gear want inexpensive solution , sanus afa models may you .	1

me , this truly plug play device delivers goods ... set up literally two minutes . i simply needed more signal strength , some my machines suffered marginal signal . now , all them receive excellent signal . signal strength needs , i really think this device something should tried first before going alternative -- wireless range expanders/extenders . wireless range expanders , which require configuration routers , work very well once set up correctly . but many people i consider tech-savvy ( including myself ) pulled their hair out making them work . bottom line , this trick actiontec router came my fios service . $90 , it pricey , but time savings well worth it . think additional time saved if you ever change your router or network ! some people here mentioned problems this booster , but i still think this first method try ... worse case scenario , you always return it :	1

phone easy install . it pretty much plug play . it takes day or two get used . it not like our cell phones where we so spoiled everything one button dialing or one button access everything but cit400 meets all i looking ... lightweight , easy use , clear audio , comfortable ear hands , speaker phone great !, good signal far distances ( other rooms ) , ringtone not obnoxious , most importantly , my clients cannot tell difference b/t this phone any other landline . only things i would ask linksys work ... call waiting ... beep so annoying . after call waiting rings abour 4-5 times person calling already hung up , beep continues go off every few seconds . i havent called linksys see if there anything this but i've read manual it not anywhere . also , i hate when i call this phone , it shows up other people caller id ... " 00-12345 " ... i dont think it linksys , i think this skype issue . sometimes it shows up " unknown " ... regardless , i dont want my business calls show up international number . i would rather " unknown " show up or best would my number appeared caller id . all all , this product more than meets its expectations value great	1

i picked up 327v just before new year . i found it large electronics chain store just under four hundred dollars . i knew it not built tuner , but i didn't need one what i want use this . i got it large screen computer display , watching my dvds my bedroom . overall , i must say this unit exceeded my expectations . picture quality excellent dvds . i haven't hooked it up computer yet , because it requires vga cable not come it ( i cable way ) . anyway , i only two minor complaints this unit . one bright blue led lit power button when unit off . it too bright my bedroom , so i've cover it tape . other complaint " universal " remote i my home theater receiver not able control this monitor . " learning " remote required , least most cases . this monitor too new codes programmed into most universal remotes . i purchased wall mount kit mount this unit wall , i think it looks excellent there . mount vesa 100mm 200mm pattern , which doesn't seem like common size . many mounts i saw either 100mm 100mm or 200mm 200mm . some even smaller 75mm 75mm . i finally find one right type , it very easy install wall , least me . i used built speakers think they sound great what they , but i'm waiting until i get my home theater speakers set up so i enjoy home theater experience . i know larger screen makes better home theater , but my bedroom too small make practical proposition . this screen feels like it just right size this room , approximately 14 ' 16 ' . i would recommend this monitor anyone looking something this size , long they don't need built tuner . if you satellite box , cable box , or vcr , it work tuner . order get hdtv functionality , you need hdtv capable tuner ( which most , if not all , vcrs not ) . since it no tuner , i don't understand why it buttons changing channels . this simply observation , not meant complaint this monitor	1

this keyboard folds out well i liked feel keys . however , ir connector needs direct connection ir port pda . ipaq , this port bottom handheld . 210 degree arm not rotate this area . order proper connectivity , you turn handheld its side . this then requires software program download ( not freeware i find ) rotate your screen landscape view , unless you read sideways without getting headache . before buying this product , check your handheld see if your ir port 4-8 o'clock - if so , this may difficult keyboard use	1

i purchased garmin forerunner 201 amazon , believing i buying reliable piece gear . it doesn't work properly any built up area , i.e. city , where most us live , or areas too many trees , i.e. where we city dwellers like go when we leave city . basically it leaves stretches your running route out , but stop watch carries ticking . so if you're like me , take satisfaction turning out fast-paced runs ( or what passes fast-paced us amateurs ) , 201 only source frustration . it'll time your run perfectly , just like any stop-watch ( duh ! ) , but then leave out some distance you ran , so you get mile mile average yo-yos very suspicious way . particularly when you've put out steady effort . it'll miss out bits your course different places day-by-day basis . you'll find yourself " adapting " info device gives you : how precision ? interval training feature even worst . you dial some mile repeats , timed interval , set off full blast . minutes tick mile never ends ! that when you find there gaps " mile " you're running , you're killing yourself when you've actually mile , should your rest period . i kid you not , i wouldn't dare sell gps device works 70% time i'm not speaking heavily built up areas , i run spaces where closest buildings least 60-90 feet away ... but this not worst it . i though i getting well made piece equipment . i live brazil , so i bought it off amazon , friend kindly brought it over me us . less than 1 year , it started turning on/off itself , crazy dysfunctional way , rendering it totally unusable . currently it doesn't stay more than 1 minute time . it now runs it battery flat itself . even though i'd scrupulously careful w/ it , not taking it out rain , drying off moisture sweat after every run religiously . some you may say i should used warranty , but when you mailing costs brazil-us , if thing fixed or replaced , 100% customs duty when it gets sent back here , you'd give up , just i . i'm not paying twice piece gear never worked properly first place . my conclusion : try some other model , or even brand . i'd not lay my hard-earned cash this gizmo again	-1
this worst thing . never buy this one !!! there serious noise , big problem ..	-1
these headphones , i got over 5 months ago , i use them both my mac pc . great sound quality , better than bose , no joke . surround sound amazing gameing , its cheating when compaired stereo since now , when i get sniped , i hear gunshot rear right , i turn my rear right theres sniper ... haha i love them , i bring them road trips , school , everywhere . people like " they dont look cool " i dont care ... although they bulky not too portable , great quality price . these phones better , they would noise canceling , smaller , more portable , better adapter 2.5 mm jacks , i always loose little black thing , my ipod , great sound quality , but sometimes when ipod stops musci cuz sensor thinks jack unplugged ... but this happenes like once per 30 mins , no biggie , just press play again . other than non portablility fact little adapter gets lost eaisly due my clumbseyness , there best headhones i ever purchased . dont discouraged non name brand . these headphones circles around bose since they essentially 4 speakers eash ear , sub , 1 frount , 1 rear , 1 center , they all distribute music audio well , since sub takes lows , center takes midrange , take tweeters , all mixed into one , sound ausome . where bose only 1 great speaker work , these headphones like compairing new dual core dual processor g5 4 processors single g5 imac , great performance , but 4 brains ( speakers ) better than one !!	1

if you're looking high-end , look clifford alarms , they now owned same parent company viper but they offer more user-programming options . hardware comparable quality , cliffords just offer more features . i clifford my sedan viper my truck . viper actually louder siren , but unlike clifford if i want adjust sensitivity glass breakage detector i take it back dealer whereas clifford i just it through remote . tip : make sure whoever installs your viper puts it " active arming " mode instead " passive arming " which drive you crazy because it automatically arm alarm every time you close all vehicle doors . i understand it higher up viper alarms simply added features like remote start 2-way remotes , but you not getting any upgraded hardware . these still way better than no-name cheapo alarms coming out now best buy other places . don't cut corners install , it involves cutting into your car electrical system so you want somebody who knows what they're doing	1

it seems run well cool , no doubt because its well thought out packaging . seagate reputation producing good drives . i bought this portable " master drive " use among two or more computers . why carry more than you ? i thought , save space , i would get few retractable usb cables avoid necessity always carrying more clutter cables . surprise !!! seagate uses extremely special purpose usb cable connect its usb receptacle . none my other cables work it . firstly , receptacle so far recessed into drive casing ordinary usb cable cannot reach into it . secondly , if you cut away some plastic surrounding male end cable , it fit into receptacle but ( surprise ! ) it not work . why ? i not know . i tried several other cables worked other drives devices but none worked seagate . i tried searching similar cables internet but , after searching exhaustively , found nothing . you contact seagate buy its special purpose cables ( $9.25 + tax/shipping each ) . pretext odd shaped cable some computers need second usb jack additional power . course , this rare it strikes me simply profit enhancement dodge . result : 8% higher cost more cable clutter	1

i used sw radios many years many manufacturers : sony , grundig , sangean , radio shack ( made sangean ) . this model eton stands up them all , elegantly designed , logical easy use , great sound . manual short sweet , well written . once you know drill , all settings easy fast . quite intuitive well . there amazing 500 possible presets , though i barely scape up 30 i would use regularly . sound all bands rich . fm superb . there even ' antenna trim ' usable sw bands which rare all but most expensive radios . design feel elegant solid . all buttons knobs positive , affirmative action . two criticisms : e10 goes through sets four batteries little eight hours , entire memory wiped out when batteries get low . but , all all , great radio price	1
good , but just short great . key action nice light , low-travel makes it very easy your fingers really fly across keys , pretty quietly , too . i like fact they trying make keyboards more spill resistant , because i killed more than one keyboard spilling drink it . i no idea how well spill-resistance , though , i am not willfully go testing it out or anything . profile very thin , footprint also smaller than average . personally , i would not minded keyboard little bit wider , because order save space , microsoft re-arranged insert-delete-home-end-pgup pgdn keys two vertical lines instead more common two horizontal lines . i use those keys quite bit text file navigation while programming , learning how use this new configuration touch took me week or so , which kind annoying . small niggle lack usb adapter . doubt , it helps keep price down , but i would really love able use this keyboard my ibook well my pc , but order , i'll buy third-party adapter . , always , inclusion extra keys top keyboard almost useless . i say almost , because i actually use calculator key often enough , but rest nothing but waste space . despite these complaints , i still think one thing microsoft still well hardware . their keyboards mice pretty solid . basic , no frills keyboard , this much better than you would usually get so cheap .	1

number radio stations not yet bought up clear channel , still aimed somewhat graying population , steadily decreasing , we looking radio ability receive one last stations houston area we enjoyed listening , but , because its location 40 miles away liberty , texas , impossible pick up our home . we thought it possible , because plain-jane radio our f-150 picked up station very clearly pasadena we drove work baytown . we tried couple other radios advertised their ability what we wanted , able reach out farther separate stations situated closely radio dial , but no success all . i don't remember where i first heard boston acoustic radio , but it appeared able what we wanted , i continued search out everything it i could , using google . limited experience amazon.com, i knew many vendors sell their merchandise discount here , , " voila . " there it , lowest price i found anywhere . radio arrived almost soon if i'd bought it mall , we nothing but happy it since . my son , who more critical ear than me , told me sound really good . we now get hear enjoy khsn-fm 99.9 mhz , " shine-all-nine " here pasadena . unsuspected bonus , we're also able pick up more powerful am stations(at night , when weather right ) located around middle country , st. louis(kmox-am 1120 ) , shreveport(kwkh-am 1130 ) , nashville , gallatin , tennessee . bottom line -- high quality am-fm radio , very decent price . i like it	1
com'on folks ... let real here . coby cv-h42 headphones may decent sound pair cheap headphones , but com'on ... they're only $5 or less . i've tried them non-amplified computer monitior work , they sound decent . bass average best . if these 40mm driver , then i'd hate hear what smaller one coby set would sound like . i've also tried them my at-home 5.1 amplified pc set-up they distort way too easily . bass distorts almost slightest bit bass . i concur those who say it roll dice get good working pair , left-speaker my set bit weak . i mean let face it ... these some pretty cheap headphones ... if you want cheap , but great sounding pair headphones , you better look set $15+ range . take instance koss ktx-pro 1 titaniums $18 here amazon . they're sold upwards $45 retailers like radio shack . all glowing reviews , they're hellava set headphones . i gave this set 2-stars only because they're decent cheap pair , but audiophiles , stear clear	1

first all - i really enjoy listening xm radio , which what made me consider buying this extension device receiver . it truly good way further utilize roady2 , allowing you listen either xm , or tune local fm stations ( why anyone would want this , i don't know - maybe emergency or something ) . unit fairly simple set up . you first need charge battery putting it into place plugging included ac adapter . it takes 2 hours charge then you ready use unit . you slide roady2 into device until it plugs . ( if you set up roady2 home adapter or auto adapter - you must first remove backing plate roady2 - it snap off little leverage ( light ) straight edge screwdriver . ) after you installed roady2 unit , you good go . first , volume tuning controls side unit little vexing use , but some practice helps you readily raise or lower volume or tune fm radio stations . additional help , there small wheel volume control right ear section headphones . headphone acts your antenna unit whole thing then works very well . i am pleased this unit , but i would advise shopping price , it vary much $100.00 low high . all all , nice addition further utilize roady2	1

maximum archival life cds , it good idea keep them both jewel case , outer container well . after doing fairly extensive web search , i discovered selection boxes hold cds , while contained within jewel case , actually rather limited . many these cases $30-$60 range , actually hold fewer cds than these cases o.o downside , these cases rather plain appearing business-like . but i didn't want flaming pink , anyway . also , their style not lend them portable . files used daily , or something you want carry around you , it may good idea get something more durable carrying handle , made metal or heavy plastic . these boxes made out coated cardboard , fact clearly stated description . but they quite sturdy , if used only occasionally , should last many years . but these cases could damaged , if they accidentally soaked water , or kept extremely damp environment . archival storage occasional access , this best deal i could find , especially considering almost-nominal price . if you lot cds , fill several-to-many containers , only access them occasionally ; these boxes good choice . i probably buy some more , i continue generate cds need stored .	1

i used acronis true image 9 year . i never needed it until today when i cloned my laptop drive external usb drive , put new 100 gb drive laptop , put acronis boot disk , then cloned usb drive back laptop . voila ! perfect . perfectly functioning drive .... but now i 100 gb not 40 gb . i problems getting backup images complete error-free ( sure you defrag your hd first before you image if it needs it ) . i also problems images when i use ' check-verify integrity image ' utility . one time it tells me image corrupt , i run it again it says its fine . screensavers may culprit here .... disable them when making image . if you're going make image ' set it forget it ' .... don't try working your machine while it images . acronis says you this but i don't see point ' driving car trying photograph it same time ( get it ? )' .... it doesn't make sense . use image time spend some quality time your kids , wife , or etc . it took me 39 minutes clone 37.2 gb data onto new 100gb drive . i agree several other users : clone only . cloned drive backups beautiful . you open it explorer , peruse your files folders just like your primary drive , all order check sure data there . here tip : use acronis ti clone your drive . then use program like storage crypt 2.0 encrypt this drive .... then put it your car glove box , your garage , safe deposit box , your tool shed ... anywhere but your house ( don't forget clone occasionally ) . when your house burns down , gets hit tornado ( i live kansas ) , or thieves steal your equipment , you hidden encrypted backup clone drive your data . heck , you replace laptop ; it data you cannot replace . drive encrypted it stolen not show up when connected computer unless you know what program encrypted it what password de-crypt it so it shows up windows explorer . i give it 4 stars because ' image ' function not reliable . but cloning superb	1

i owned pair etymotic er6is pair shure e2s , which both very good quality earbuds , but i say , this far best pair in-ear-monitors i ever owned . you really hear difference earbuds single drivers these dual driver monitors . lows highs don't interfere each other , which may may difficult understand , but you when you hear them . no matter how low bass , highs still constant unaffected ... vice versa . however , my opinion , difference audio quality these earbuds pair less price ( like shure e2cs , example ) , what some may consider , subtle . but , true audiophile , this difference just enough justify spending so much pair buds . i took these through few brief tests when i got them , playing several mp3s rather bass heavy known produce poor sound previously owned earbuds ... i smiled . ues played bass clearly highs bright uninterrupted , way they meant heard . construction quality materials , they could use some work . cord tad bit cheap i'm curious see how long it lasts before shorting out , but brings me absolutely genius idea they created . user replaceable cord . everyone knows , cords short out . there no headphone not short out . my guess , drivers last quite some time , but no matter what , cord short out . well , $20 , you get brand new cord . old one simply unplugs buds ... but don't worry just yet , because they very generous 2 year warranty . what more could you ask ? short , i recommend buying these earbuds . they best i've ever owned , if you very picky ears , they'll appreciate them	1

i bought this printer because my wife wanted printer she could print out photo her new canon digital camera . since camera canon pictbridge , no computer needed this printer . you print directly camera which quick easy . this printer only photo , but it prints out great looking 4 6 pictures very fast . quality excellent , i don't believe you distinguish them pictures printed photo lab . i didn't actually measure how long it took print picture , but it very fast . good guesstimate would appox 60-80 seconds . it not use ink , but process called dye sublimation . according photo printer experts , photos dye-sublimation printer much more durable fade much more slowly than photos inkjet printer . dye-sublimation printing process performed three times , one time each cyan , magenta , yellow dyes , then repeated fourth time apply protective coating print . protective coating applied during fourth pass laminate blocks uv ( ultraviolet ) light , makes dye-sub print waterproof , scratch-resistant fade-resistant . so , this printer give you instant gratification lab quality prints last lifetime without fading ! this printer very compact , so you actually take it you if you want . there optional battery so you print out pictures anytime , anywhere . most people this won't necessary , but those professional individuals who might currently using older " polaroid " instant camera , this allows you take big step up picture quality ! i believe using this printer your digital camera would also less expensive . print cartridges photo paper sold set . i found amazon best prices . only drawback ( which isn't really negative ) cost print cartridges photo paper . it slightly higher than average . quality prints convenience however should taken into consideration . instant gratification quality comes slight premium , i fully believe it worth it . we purchased 100 pack amazon around $23.00 shipping . works out $0.23 ea . only $0.06 more local photo lab . ( doesn't include gas , wear tear car time traveling local photo mega mart . probably washes if you really want analyze it death .... )	1

i primarily use this unit while walking out side during lunch break . hence review based usage nature headphone . good1 . it stays put . staying put reason , i purchsed headphone first place . 2 . you barely feel it . 3 . cord some built untagling feature . unlike cord regular headphone , cord resistant tangling , making knots etc . 4 . you still hear out side sound . this huge plus me while walking out side . i want hear noises cars bikes street . bad1 . sound quality good , but not superb . this no big deal me . i am actually trying walk quality music sound not paramount concern me .	1
i bought those few months ago i using them regular basis while flying . my opinion sound fine life time battery very acceptable . compact folding very convenient it comes few useful accessories . however , fit my ears not optimal ( it seems recurring subject reviews ) , eventually it hurt little . i would recommend headphones female or somebody smaller ears . hope helps	1

this remote truly amazing . after years handling three four remotes time , worrying batteries , misplacing them i finally say i've found remote control replaces rest . even so called universal remote controls i always go back device original remote certain functions . but beauty rm-vl600 it learn those functions very simple programming steps . i only view first two pages manual get my remote up running allowing me control my sony tv , dvd player , receiver scientific atlanta cable box echo star sat dish . long last one single remote it all ! if wasn't enough , you program 16 step sequences each ( 4 ) four macro buttons ( or system control buttons ) . i able turn off my tv , receiver sat dish push just one button . what really sweetens whole deal price . other learning remotes start around $80 , but this one under $25 ! now that just icing cake !	1

toshiba second generation unit , hd a2 , very attractive , glossy front silver trim . although console dimensions much smaller more streamlined than a1 , we lose analog audio outputs . its width height comparable typical dvd player , however , its depth little longer , few inches back . no biggie . remote medium sized , black plastic plenty function buttons , but not very intuitive their placement . start up minute or less , which not very annoying if you power unit , then go get snack or take bio break , etc . hd dvd take 30 seconds play . again , neglible wait ample rewards . i own sony 50 inch 50a2000 sxrd 1080p display , which no problems handshaking toshiba via hdmi output . i purchased 9 hd dvd watched 6 so far . every title except one ( terminator 3 - it nice , but expecting more relatively new film , since dvd looked so good ) ranged impressive stunning . thing('82 ) breathtaking . detail kurt russel beard , eye color , etc . popped . mutiny bounty looked like oil painting . willy wonka beautiful . lee marvin never looked so good dirty dozen ( minor film grain ) . it wonderful thing movie hd all extras one side disc , so far . i not seem miss player capable 1080p vs . 1080i , but technology drops price , i may further investigate matter . some(the ht guys ) say , lcd displays inherently progressive scan , so your set may making 1080i signal appear 1080p or close enough my liking . i wasn't willing pay extra $100 a20 find out , so please excuse my conjecture . hd dvd menus really fun , allowing one view them while movie still playing . yes , scan features fast-forwarding , rewinding little sluggish , but so first dvd players . price 1st ... or 2nd . i usually am playing hd dvd wowed picture resolution , not zip through it . some hd dvd titles offer zoom function , allowing you focus 2 , 4 or 8 times closer , however , it doesn't seem ready prime time . if you try pan around screen while zoom , player audio jitter lose sync , which reset stopping machine then hitting play again . again , i am not usually zooming around . i want theater experience my home , but it system limitation . upon reading numerous reviews regarding a2 upscaling potential regular dvd , i understandably curious . i own 2 upconverting dvd players , one panasonic one sony . both use hdmi connections . although panasonic seems brighter more colorful than sony , panasonic seems more combing noise . perhaps , i am not critcial , but it seemed close shave toshiba a2 my other upconverting players far regular dvd , so i can't say i blown away matter . i really like fact toshiba a2 digital clock , adjustable led display dimmer , very nice statistic data via display button(codec type , time , duration , chapters , available audio formats ) i am very happy pcm audio output my optical connection . i not hdmi switching my amp yet . bottom line : if you hdtv you want show off its 1080 resolution reasonable price you can't wait decent combo player or just want " wowed " budget , i wholeheartedly recommend this machine your home theater	1
aspiring triathlete self-admitted gadget freak , i'm always looking something new track my progress . this little device fantastic . i contemplating upgrading my polar hrm one " footpod " tracks speed/distance - but i'm glad i bought this instead . pro con's:pro's:1 . incredibly easy use , program , manipulate . my overriding thought since i got it polar could learn alot garmin . i've my polar s450 3 years still can't get it everything it supposed . 2 . lightweight , wristwatch style configuration imperceptible while wearing it . fact , it lighter than my polar hrm , which i wear other wrist . 3 . incredibly accurate . used it while biking other day ... distance other measurements right my cyclocomputer . 4 . very user-friendly software interface , uploading run takes seconds , without any additional user involvement other than plugging it into computer . 5 . price - very , very reasonable . con's:only one , it stretch ... can't use it while swimming . triathlete , i would liked able accurately measure my distance speed during open water swims . now i kinda wish i'd bought 405 ( built hr monitor ) . maybe when polar wears out ! great tool terrific value	1
this small gps receiver same length width my usb flash drive twice thick . but despite small size , this unit far ahead hp bluetooth gps receiver i previously used . it get satellite fix usually within 10-15 seconds . it even get satellite fix while indoors ( course not any real value but it just shows how sensitive unit ) . i put it my shirt pocket while driving still maintain signal . it small enough attach it my car keyring ( it slot loop type fob ) . way , i am using iguidance gps software my cingular 8125 mobile phone . it hold charge 8 hours charged car charger ( included ) or even usb port my laptop . usb cable , i use it gps receiver my laptop which not built-in bluetooth . so why only 4 stars ? well , it this strange instruction : ' it prohibited operate this system while driving your car ' huh ??? must ' lost translation ' episode taiwanese documentation . otherwise , i recommend this unit if you want very small but very capable gps bt receiver .	1
i purchased my samsung 56 " dlp nearly two years ( 6/05 ) ago even though i paid higher price than other reviewers it still great value . it surpassed all my expectations . watching discovery hd planet earth series or other similar high definition programming makes me glad i made investment . i not experienced any problems date bulb , fan , or color wheel tv average 8 hours day . only shortcoming appears everyone list non-user-friendly pip .	1

sennheiser got it right . these simple . they comfortable , even long runs . they great sound . they stay put while i am running . gravity enemy other headphones i've used , always making them slip out ear or away position optimal sound . because design these earpieces conecting band , gravity actually holds them place . i never fidget them . also , since there only one lead wire , it stays out way without trying engineer solution . these best i've tried	1
i love these cases . i bought one set try out thinpaking my dvds , then ordered 4 more rest . i currently own 157 dvds , so far i've moved 97 over these cases ( rest mostly box sets or already thinpaked ) . its very easy adjust covers fit these thinner cases , just trim 1-2 mms two sides , then slide it . i recommend using straight edge blade ruler or other straight guide get best results . every new dvd i get immediately get moved these cases future . my entertainment center no longer double stacked looks much neater	1
this cd player works well sounds great . all functions what you would expect shuffle actually plays randomly . i highly recommend this unit ; it cannot beat price	1
first downside:i've found bluetooth pretty much worthless . if you get link hold it works fine but i've never seen phone gps stay linked entire trip . unit lots buttons options , however so many buttons you cannot possibly hold unit without inadvertently hitting one them . now upside : gps works fantastic performing its main function , getting you where you need go . i replaced my roadmate 700 this unit i tell you i am impressed operation 6000t . i not expecting 6000t much better then 700 but i wrong . this unit picks up your position very quickly i yet see it drop signal while traveling . it everything my 700 but it it even faster better . considering i paid $1100 back when i purchased 700 i paid less then $500 6000t , i don't see how you go wrong this unit . it shame they couldn't get bluetooth right but when you take everything into account , i'm happy i decided go this gps .	1
i using this product month , so far i am happy it . drive so small amount data i carry arund , so i am afraid lose it . , secure ii gives me great sense security . secure ii 9mb . it saved drive just like any other files you save , not protected anyway accidental deletion . so you careful not delete it other unwanted files or reformatting . first thing i make backup entire folder my pc . secure ii runs without any installation your computer . it create vault areas flash drive . example , if you make vault area called myspace size 500mb , you find file myspace . lxv ( size 500mb ) created secure ii folder . even if vault empty , lxv file takes up 500mb available space flash drive goes down 1.5 gb . anything you save vault absorbed reserved 500mb space not reduce remaining space ( 1.5 gb this case ) . using file explorer , all file names , or any related data , saved vault not shown , it shows only myspace . lxv . vault only accessible when computer you insert drive logged administrator . i created vault my home computer tried open it work computer which i don't administrative privilege . vault access dimmed out secure ii , i could not retrieve files inside . product calls win2000 xp system requirement . i tried it windows me machine , flash drive itself worked fine but secure ii not run seeking dll file . i one complaint physical design . hole strap ( which not come product ) put cap , not body . you come home notice you've lost drive data stored it , but cap still securely attached string your brief case .	1
how many pictures it store ? it most commonly asked question digital camera enthusiast but usually question most difficult get straight answer . well , considering i worked memory industry over 7 years i help clarify this perplexing question so unbiased i since changed industries . simpletech sti-sd/256 256mb securedigital card sd , like most 256mb cards , store average 284 pictures when used 2 megapixel camera , 213 images when used 3 megapixel camera , 128 pictures when used 4 megapixel camera , 102 images when used 5 megapixel camera , 80 pictures when used 6 megapixel camera . these numbers based off assumption you going shoot your images highest quality jpeg setting available camera understand they estimates may off much 10 percent due numerous factors including complexity scene shot compression algorithm used your specific camera . i truly hope this review helpful you determining whether this card right capacity your specific needs	1

i bought this cable connect my playstation 3 hdtv set only dvi ( i think it dvi-i ) but no hdmi . this cable works beautifully . image quality really good . price just can't beat . you should aware while hdmi carries both audio video , dvi video only , so you still need route audio your tv somehow . example , i use optical digital audio cable ( together expensive converter box my old hdtv set doesn't optical input )	1

i originally looking $[ ... ] radios , but i concerned product durability quality fm/am reception . after reading some good reviews this sangean dt-300-vw , i decided jump higher price range try it . it great product , durable well worth price . i've used it 5-days week , more than 18 months now . i'm little hard it because i use it outside 30 minute jogs 45 minute bike rides . after all use , there just little static when adjusting volume control . 900mah rechargable batteries last more than couple weeks me . unit shuts off before batteries go completely dead , if you replace both batteries one time , you won't lose station settings . power lock good use either during activity , or when you store radio . i mostly listen fm music stations , am talk radio . reception fine both . clock alarm useful features . i keep case unit protection , but don't use belt-loop because it easily breaks off . unit small enough me hold my hand while jogging , or place my waist band while bike riding . i hate in-ear bud headphones , so i just purchased some regular external ones seperately	1
product exactly you would expect . drivers installed easily winxp(haven't tried vista yet ) , it compatible both software applications i wanted it . i use it primarily netstumbler , i've only one hiccup , but it com port conflict , so i can't really blame it device . your money , you can't go wrong	1
got mine two weeks ago all i say it just works beautifully . setup snap , no webpages or reading manual find out what default ip address , or anything like . i configured this thing 5 minutes literally ( i'm geek though ) not touched it since then . i'm using all features , cable router , wireless , sharing two disks printing ( using small belkin 4 port usb hub ) all this functionality just transparent my mac . wireless signal quality surprisingly good considering there no antennas hanging out device . also , disk sharing feature works quite fast over wireless , but you really feel difference if you wired though ( i'm using ) . it couple minor drawbacks my opinion , ( 1 ) lack gige , i don't care it but dealbreaker some guys ( 2 ) pricey if you just want router . although , if you think all features it makes sense spend few extra $	1

i recently purchased this item here , i so very impressed . it drastically improved quality my dvd player . you know difference quality when you switch watching regular tapes ( vhs ) dvd ? well , it same " step " when you watch dvds s-video , watching dvds s-video . my son said his playstation 2 looked 10 times better this s-video cord . it definatetly worth money ! highly recomended	1

my review this based my rating forerunner 201 unit itself . this just bracket , it works fine . however , you don't really need it if you don't mind simply wearing 201 your wrist . one caveat it , course , easier see unit when you riding if it mounted bike versus strapped your wrist . my recommendation if you going use 201 both running biking , don't buy this bracket because you simply wear 201 , plus then you don't deal trying remove wristband or making tight squeeze fit into bike bracket . but , if you buying 201 only biking , this may useful because then you could simply ditch wrist strap keep this mounted bike all times .	1
transferring first album my pc took roughly 5 hours . second took 3.5 hours , third 2 hours fourth 1.5 hours . learning software interface took inordinate amount time , even though i've interface programmer . after learning software , it appears every album cost hour record , mark songs , name songs write songs mp3 . if i want edit out song parts or eliminate pops/clicks , it take longer . it really time consuming software doesn't make it simple or intuitive . turntable reasonable quality . it just regular turntable built-in pre-amp . you turn pre-amp `on ' when recording your pc , turn if `off ' if you want use turntable your regular stereo	1

retrospect , i am not sure how well this worked . reviewer stated below , after couple years , when using my cordless phone , i started hear static , then eventually , i heard very loud , annoying pulse tone which person i called also heard . assuming line noise due my phone/dsl line , i called my telephone service provider check line . i thinking changing my dsl line filters or buying new phone ( assuming some problem my panasonic 2.6 ghz phone ) . when i figured out this device responsible , zapper went immediately into garbage . not sure what started problems ( bad battery ?, latent defect ? ) . end , am not sure how effective this device i still received plenty unsolicited calls . any case , this device not worth trouble cost .	-1

life long bose basher here , good reason ! many years ago ( 1990 ) i bought bose acoustimas system . it stereo store it sounded amazing - i bought one took it home it sounded tinny , flat cheap . i found out bose charges ton pay their marketing . they still use paper speaker drivers ! i returned acoustimass system years later tried 1-2-3 system ( 2 years ago ) i hooked up new system underwhelmed . my sony 60 " xbr tv speakers sounded just good . i returned it bose store , sweraing never buy bose product . ( i buy some tri-port headphones which very muddy bloated sounding)well , 2 weeks ago i bose store i saw wave music system new acoustic wave system . guy store told me new ( larger ) acoustic wave system their best stereo system . i bought one $1079 took it home . it sounded horrible . harsh , flat not spacious ( this larger acoustic wave ) all ! i felt ripped off . it ugly , cheap looking sounded horrible . my tivoli model 1 sounded better . not loud but better . off bose store i go return it . ( let me also say 3 years ago i owned $ 25,000 stereo only system super high end tube amps , pre amps , $5k cd player , etc . it my dream system i sell last year i some money issues . i really missed my system . ) so i return bose look little , smaller wave music system . it sounded spacious , big depth it very pleasing . it sounded much better than their so called " best " system . i shocked bose would make $1079 product sounded bad much worse than their $500 system . i decided take home graphite give themn one last chance . took it home , set it up wow ! it looked great my table . very nice look i love it no buttons it . plugged it .... this what i looking ! deep , big , spacious , room filling sound just enough bass . it sounded amazing piano music , jazz , classical , vocals , big band ... i then threw some rock consisting ac/dc , kiss even metallica . it sounded very good . not good other music but still bass , sounded very very good . i finally happy bose product ! add this alarm function , auto dimming display small size you think $500 deal . i bought large backlit remote $39 go it next day . bose wave music system great sounding system . those who bash this new version never heard it , period . remember , i came $ 25,000 system nothing made me happy until this system . not this any way better or even comparable my $25k system , but it kills larger acoustic wave , tivoli model 1 , boston acoustics $500 set cambride set . ( yes , i tried them all)if you wanted wave system but afraid bad reviews , don't . this new version wonderful fills my house rich , clear , deep sound . throw some ricky lee jones , diana krall , frank sinatra amazed huge sound coming this litle box	1

this mouse perfect size . buttons side easy press once you get used them . now whenever i use anyone elses mouse i'm always trying find those buttons ! they're very handy . also this mouse moves very smoothly . pros : smooth tracking , buttons scroll wheel aren't loud , perfect precision , colors look fantastic when they glow ( they aren't keep you up night bright ) , white very clean looking not get dirty or chip easy all . cons : gold usb plug doesn't work when i start up my computer sometimes so i unplug mouse , plug it back , then it works . also tray icon enabled buttons sides work but it doesn't really bother me ... over all i give this mouse 5 star rating because its very easy use , its not huge mouse . i smaller hands they fit perfectly here considering most mice made ( logitech , microsoft ) so huge . i buy razer mouse if this one ever goes out	1

this must some sort joke - release this mouse sale . it looks nice , hot-link buttons function well . pointing tool , though , it utterly useless . it so sensitive slighest move sends your pointer corner screen . first i thought maybe i needed adjust new mouse , or better yet , perhaps adjust sensitivity . option 1 : you cannot adjust sensitivity . option 2 ... option 2 : maybe it just me ? unfortunately not . when mouse sits , untouched , my desk , pointer slowly drifting across my monitor screen . sometimes when i try use it select something , it impossible . i junked this pos , went back my older dell/logitech mouse .	-1

excellent idea , fatally flawed implementation . it appears limitation midi controller - drums fail sound intermittantly . since this appears design issue , except my request support ion-audio.com:i found problem my new ion ied05 electronic drum set - drums appear conflict , perhaps midi interface ( update : definitely controller ) , perhaps within alesis controller . when playing drums , pad fail sound intermittantly ( occasionally , whole system mute momentarily ) . i hope this isn't first you've heard this issue , fix available . course , i've checked connections , checked sure i'm hitting pads squarely center , tried swapping pads ( though issue affects all them , not just snare ) , etc . if fact , i often reproduce problem simply , repeatedly striking any two pads together , one split-second after other . when it happens , second appears mute first , before first fully produces tone . ________________________until/unless this issue resolved , you'll find set cause repeated frustration , whether learning , practice or performance . ________________________4/15/05 update : after sending kit back ( twice ) , received brand new replacement - which same flaw . ion support all they could - this serious design problem . final verdict - alesys drum machine seems operate fine ( triggering keyboard via midi , no drop-outs ) , but trigger-to-midi device ( ion branded black box labelled iet01 ) must problem . perhaps ok kit learning , but fatally flawed way lead no end frustration , renders kit unsuitable performance	-1
beats me , i just got it yesterday but i'll update this review time passes . i hp they seem prone heat prostrate so i decided get this yesterday , especially since last year factory installed blower spent too much time kicking into emergency mode than i liked . this computer automatically turns factory fan up high when air temperature reaches 72 degrees it loud . vcool i bought staples only one third loud when turned up high . pros : high rpm . three speed selector switch . glows blue when turned -- pretty but who cares . low apparently is/almost , silent . high one third loud factory fan running full blast . apparently blows air it sucks-in straight up . also i seem remember some this air blown down -- not much . i'm not sure temperature difference , however my computerfan usually goes high speed six times day , today it turned only once . price fair -- no s/h charges . cons : so far , only one : they should included instructions device instead assuming everybody reach them internet down load . i hope i hooked mine up correctly . i'll add or take away this review when i know more -- bye ! it april 18 -- all well .	1

this would received 5 if it weren't horrible customer service cowon . buyer beware , set your expectations very low their support . all times i treated them respect , never cursed or acted irate , which i must say very difficult considering way they treated me , new customer . 1 ) only way " speak " support through online chat or email . they not working phone numbers support . 2 ) i received 1 player , doa . replacement player also doa . it literally took 4 weeks before i received working player since they not offer cross shipping defective products ( they email ups ground shipping label , once unit arrives it sits their queue 5 business days , then they send replacement via ups ground)3 ) it not matter how professional you treat support team , they treat you like you inconveniencing them . 4 ) they not let you speak supervisor , they only relay your chat them5 ) check better business bureau rating , its currently fi really don't like so negative cowon but this whole experience left me wishing they didn't such technological superior product . i encouraged them alter their treatment their customers , never received response . even sent them letter , no response . their players great , customer support worst i ever encountered	1

okay , so i just bought jbl scs- 145.5 speaker system they absolutely horrible ! i'm sorry say , but center speaker ridiculously underpowered/barely audible other satellite speakers ( which also weak tend get distorted higher volumes or lot audio going through them ) . subwoofer * very * good , however , so i guess price tag justified subwoofer ( that why i gave it 2 stars ) , but other speakers pretty much useless . just case anyone wanted know how these , i'd recommend staying away them maybe spending slightly more getting better system	1

i've read some different opinions these ' phones people said they don't fit your head ( this ridiculous since they're adjustable ) or they very easy break , which my experience it exact opposite . i've caught cord things numerous times , somebody knock them off my desk , somebody even sat them they still remain same when i first purchased them . no scratches , cracks , disconnections or breaks any kind . i would actually inform people these quite sturdy durable instead making it seem though they snap first wrong move . sound quality just amazing price others noted , they're much better all-around headphones than sony brand same price range . i tested both long periods time gave them each fair amount burn-in . end sennheisers much bigger bang your buck . them sounding like tin cans or even more laughable : sounding better when they're cupped your hands , those statements just entirely false reviewer already pointed out . sound becomes much worse when this because it takes away sonic accuracy spatial experience . maybe reviewer who said this needs some new equipment or better understanding way these headphones supposed work . when you buy open headphones ( which , way , reproduce better sound than closed pair ) you should know what you're getting fact people able hear what you're listening if they're close enough . quality much better , that difference it reason they made this way . if you're looking privacy , grab sony v6 . all all these well worth price tag definitely bring smile your face if they're your first , second , or even third dip into audiophile territory . however , you must keep moving up line if your expectations become too high . headphones this range only so much these most certainly get job tag attached them . sure give them fair chance lot burn-in before you judge them	1

actually it took me quite while find this little gem internet . my google amazon searches weren't turning up hdtv receivers mac . i stumble eyetv products amazon search but i confused analog versus digital capabilities . there also matter ' it work my macmini g4 ' . after extensive review eyetv site , it appeared miglia tvmini hdtv what i looking . i must admit i still unsure if g4 good enough exercise all its capabilities . well i bought it anyway . it took me 15 minutes set it up i receiving hdtv 9 channels . wow , easy . recording capabilities worked just fine . here useful site : http://www.antennaweb.org/this site tells you what digital tv stations your area how strong signal . my area it said simple omni directional antenna would work most stations , not all . they right target . little antenna comes free miglia tvmini hdtv works pretty good . i get few drop outs several stations just predicted , but most them come just fine . still , i'm looking get better antenna . i just got get extra channel . philips phdtv3 looks like good choice . i'll try it see . good job miglia	1

i just needed small inexpensive radio good stereo headphone jack listen work better reception than my iriver music player this guy fit bill perfectly . amazon carries suprisingly few compact fm radios digital tuning aren't garbage . no matter , this exactly what i needed . reception far better than my music player , even antenna unextended , battery life phenomenal . i've this few months , listening it average few hours week i am still my first pair batteries . my only complaint it others noted , tuner volume knobs hyper-sensitive . full range volume barely audible too loud occurs over like eighth rotation knob . fine tuning stations chore because it go 101.10 mhz 101.15 mhz pretty much just breathing it ( it 0.05 mhz digital tuning resolution ) . since tuning knob side , it gets budged slighly every time you remove it included sleeve so you need re-fine-tune it receive your station everytime you take it sleeve which gets kind frustrating . overall quality radio many features belie its low price . four stars based its fm tuner capability alone	1

i've my old logitech mouse more years than i remember . past few weeks wheel started acting up i finally decided it time order new mouse . this one looked lot like old one so i ordered it . i plugged it it worked right away . so far so good . wheel worked great ! plus . pointer true wire long enough suit my needs . i thought i'd died gone heaven , but then annoying clicking mouse brought me back around . click , click , click .... i decided i could get used over time . then i realized this mouse not one buttons old one . simple push button i'd go back screen internet . new mouse round thing looks like button , but it doesn't anything -- it just decoration place show logitech logo . i'm so disappointed not " back " button any longer . i so spoiled years . i needed new mouse this one wasn't too expensive , so i'll keep it . not altogether pleased it though -- thus " 4 " star rating .	1

this tv huge . i originally planning purchasing 50-55 inch tv $2k price range . there lot value this tv . hdtv looks awesome . it even looks better than dvds playing through over component cables . this tv doesn't 1080p support ( it 1080i though ) , but you're not really missing anything because most hdtv programs aren't transmitted higher than 720p ( which this tv fully supports ) . this tv also supports cablecards if your cable provider them available . other semi-problem mentioned earlier there wasn't enough high end inputs ( hdmi , dvi ) , it true though there enough component inputs if you prefer . anynet function tv guide feature useless me , but it always nice extra features . one neatest features plugging my computer into tv through d-sub ( 15 pin monitor ) input . though some care made so you don't accidentally set resolution something can't displayed properly tv . it pretty finicky when it comes what resolutions displayed unlike regular monitor . one other minor issue i viewing angle . tv doesn't come stand , so some thought put into placement this tv . optimal viewing , you want able eye level center tv . overall , i am very satisfied this tv purchase recommend it very good dlp solution those don't need 1080p or lot higher end digital inputs . edit - newer 61 " 1080p model ( hl-r6168w ) samsung might more value only few hundred dollars more prices posted amazon today ( 4.3.06 )	1

bought over 2 months ago , i've yet get tired this little piece ingenuity . i looking multi-usb hub got targus notebook chillhub because it hub plus those fans . hub it works great even when connected only my laptop those low-end attachments like flash drives , etc . if i need more usb power and/or want utilize fans cool my notebook ( which it quietly well ) , i plug ac adapter . granted it bit smaller than my laptop sometimes slipped when i moved it , but i fixed small piece two-sided tape one corner . even if it didn't ( or i didn't use ) fans , its good keeping laptop off flat surfaces so heat doesn't get chance build up more destructive levels . my only beef adapter ( hence 4 stars ) , which should unplugged outlet it still pulls power even when disconnected chillhub . when adapter plugged , it gets very warm even when fans not . i'm not too sure it'll last lifetime chillhub . i also don't like its shape -- its size it made too wide taking over next plug well . overall , though , i'm very happy my purchase , which , time , almost half price found staples	1
i never enjoy reading long reviews so i'll get straight point . idrops works but like all stratch removers it needs time many applications . 5-10 minor stratches , 15-20 medium , 20+ deep ones ... don't worry this bottle literally thousand applications ... cloth you use idrops very important ... i recommend eyeglass microfiber cloth ... 1.50 walmart ... i tried using soft tissue paper it actually added more scratches ... okay , actual process ... 1 . use 2-4 drops time screen2 . take your microfiber cloth slow hard pressure go across screen3 . this 15 seconds stop ( after time it starts dry up dry idrops actually starts sratch your screen)4 . its important remember when you redo steps again you use different part cloth cause dry part restratches it . okay now thats it , it seems bit nit-picky but hey thats what it takes . you might end up running out room your cloth apply idrops so just wash it hot water throughly wring it throw it microwave minute go it again . make sure its dry . it could whole hour before you finally finish especially deep stratches . idrops looks like it makes your stratches little more faded each time . well thats all i got . enjoy your new looking screen . god bles	1

sandisk 4 gb cruzer mini sturdy reliable usb flash drive very reputable company . i've using 1 gb 4 gb over year back up transfer data various systems , no problems . drive requires no special drivers unless you using windows 98 . there green led base drive lights when it accessed . package includes 2 extra endcaps neck strap , drive ships 3 software applications installed . if you don't want use applications you just delete them recover small amount space they use . cruzerlock 2 data security software encryption , free version . i found its interface bit cumbersome , but it job . time-limited trial versions pocketcache ( backup software ) cruzersync ( outlook my documents folder synchronization ) software also installed drive . pocketcache some nice features , including tracking multiple history versions file , cruzersync makes backup email , favorites , etc . easier ; however version shipped my drive only works outlook , not outlook express . you find more information software going sandisk website viewing cruzer applications page . if you read more reviews net you'll find some complaints drive slow . there faster ones out there ( they cost more ) including sandisk titanium , but it never issue me . this drive compatible older usb 1.1 machines , still gives acceptable performance even speed . some people complain it easy lose endcaps ( 3 caps included ) . if you snap cap base while you're using drive , it lot harder lose . drives very sturdy - i accidentally stepped one without any damage . i've read two stories users accidently running drive through washer leaving it pocket . once it dried out , it worked fine no loss data . only negative point i've experienced if you want use neck strap , it difficult thread through eyelet drive . but bit patience , it doable , it only needs once . aware there lot counterfeit copies this product market . most negative reviews losing data , or drive malfunctioning traced counterfeit . sure buy reputable company like amazon or newegg , if you any doubts check serial number sandisk after you buy . i definitely recommend this drive , buy sandisk products again .	1

first product i ever bought razer one their copperhead mice . it expensive , but i impressed overall design quality product . i've mouse more than year now haven't any problems , even heavy use . when i heard razer branching out into pc audio , i naturally curious . so i decided pick up pair these headphones , their ac-1 sound card . again , they expensive but i felt i would makeup design quality . when i first opened box i found cord melted together few places , like wire insulator hadn't cooled properly before it rapped together plastic twisty . i also found if i pulled these bonds apart , they revealed bare wire . not good . so i sent it back , got replacement . when i opened second pair i found same thing , addition one fancy led lights not working . luckily , i able pull various bonds apart without revealing any bare wire . light still doesn't work though . i am , say least , disappointed razer here . i since read other reviews people complaining similar issues relating quality headphones . ( screws coming loose , volume control loosing responsiveness , etc . ) gamers particular tend use headphones hard don't appreciate when they " break " before their time . if i am going shell out much money headphones , i would like quality product reflect price	1

hp photosmart c5180 printer , hewlett packard brought market very good multifunction device great price point . although it doesn't seem part current hp product line any longer , it still great multifunction device deserves your consideration if you market new printer or multifunction device . you get lot features packed into one unit . printer scanner , there also set memory card slots accept most popular types digital camera memory . control panel features one touch access many functions , including copier functionality . small color lcd lets you adjust printer settings , make copies , configure onboard network interface perform basic photo editing printing functions . unlike any other printer i've seen before , hp includes some document " templates " printer memory . these templates let you make graph paper ruled sheets notebook paper . finally , there included ethernet interface , which lets you connect photosmart c5180 network use it multiple computers . out box setup easy . removing packaging tape inserting ink cartridges first time very straightforward process . inks click easily positively into place . when you've completed basic setup turned unit , you're ready start installing software connecting unit your computer . hp provides two options connectivity -- you use either usb or plug device into ethernet network . i used network connection . hp software found device immediately configured it no intervention my par t.t he included software bundle available pc macintosh computers . added bonus , macintosh version software universal binary -- , it runs both powerpc intel macintosh computers . hp software selection pretty well rounded . you get everything you need organize print photos , make scans adjust printer settings . i found software easy install able use it well within twenty minutes completing installation . if you use network connection , photosmart c5180 basic management web page used quickly check ink levels even perform immediate scan show up image your web browser . ink life excellent print quality very good . photographs printed this printer using special hp photo paper look just like professional prints hold up well handled . text documents not quite crisp those coming laser printer , but they still look very sharp clear . after printing several photos over 200 pages black text documents , only cartridge showed any drop capacity black one . all others still show completely full . unlike many printers , you won't break bank consumables . you buy all six ink tanks 150-pack small photo paper $36 usd . ink also purchased color , $8 usd per color or $12 usd black ink . this helps offset purchase price this printer . unfortunately , there some things not so great unit . starters , pc version software takes long time install . while stability intel version macintosh software nearly perfect , powerpc version didn't nearly so well . i saw lot unexpected crashes or applications disappeared outright , especially when managing photos my powerpc g4 mac mini . some people reported unit scanner not very good . scanner unfortunate tendency produce " noisy " scans , especially items lot dark colors . photocopies made using " black " copy button greenish cast them . i able solve this problem using " color " button copy black white documents instead . printer also moves very swiftly . this isn't problem much it notice caution . you should place unit only very sturdy table or desk , it moves quickly enough some printing modes it could possibly fall off or break what you've placed it . hp technical support could lot better . first one these units i purchased stuck " manufacturing mode " would not act normally . representative i spoke hard understand , didn't seem understand my problem couldn't offer any advice solve problem other than returning printer hp replacement . i returned it directly vendor instead . replacement worked perfectly every respec t.t his unit uses print heads separate ink tanks . while ink easily replenished , i saw no way replacing installed print heads . they look permanently installed , which suggests if they ever fail or become clogged , you may buying new printer . considering hp builds printers usually last very long time , this comes across me surprising decision their part . only time tell sure . finally , there some features i would liked see this unit . topping list would duplex printing module . some higher photosmart models this feature added . it seems like hp planned offer this c5180 well . internal web page " duplexer installed " field , back door completely removed . second would inclusion document feeder . network scanning functionality very handy , but it gets little tedious get up , walk across room change document scanner bed . again , higher end models photosmart lineup include this feature . all things considered , i find hp photosmart c5180 overall good product . it some areas where it needs improvement , but what product doesn't ? i don't think you go wrong this product , much what it very well	1

this ( it super cheap little brother ) some most hyped items audiophile land . i approached super-t skepticism : i mean it 10 wpc amp cheesy outboard power supply . how good could it ? answer very good indeed . my setup athena as-b 1.2 ( super cheap $99 speakers high 90db sensitivity ) , very good speaker wire ( straightwire maestro - yes it worth more than rest system - but it lying around ) g4 ipod losslessly compressed rips music forceful , tuneful , involving . this combo strengths jazz , female vocals , folk , pop , small ensemble classical stuff . hard rock orchestral stuff sounds little small . its zone competency very wide , however - within it bass rich great pace . trebles sweet extended . midrange lush tube-like incredible presence . vocalists sound like they're room i frequently stop what i'm doing ( system my kitchen - so i'm usually cooking ) listen - very good sign . this level musicality this price outstanding . this system blows away my mid-level system dynaco stereo 70 amp , nht model zeros . i swapped dynaco ( classic tube amp 35 wpc ) into kitchen system immediately noticed loss bass impact high end clarity i enjoyed sonic impact . caveats ? first all - it very low powered amp . means you must use very efficient speakers or it not bloom . second , your output only good source . make sure you use source great resolution or you're just wasting your time . i've heard you upgrade power supply get better sound . it wouldn't surprise me . this unit begs tweaked general . i attest it sounds great out box . this isn't true integrated amp . it offers only one input . only controls volume knob power button . me this ideal . you don't need pre-amp ! cheaper sonic impact amp doesn't binding posts ( uses clips ) plastic body smaller power supply smaller on-board caps . it also only $40 - but tweaking manditory unit . i think extra money well spent this one . considering sonic impact/athena as-b 1.2 system less than $250 rivals serious systems - i don't see any competition stay-at-home ipod system purpose-built ipod systems . cd/dvd player would also make excellent front end . this giant killer ? i don't know . i didn't put it up agains arc classic 60 my family room . i don't think it fair put $140 amp up against kilo-buck gear . sub $1000 price range it monster paradigm shifter - even given its limitations . if you listen right music - right ancillary gear , you not disappointed	1
i bought this phone used , ebay , 2 1/2 years ago . i lot reading before i bought it found there known issue battery life handsets . everyone mentioned battery life , there solution . when i bought phone , station 2 handsets $60 ebay . i immediately ordered 2 energizer er-p511 nimh batteries replace panasonic throw aways . i battery life problem my previous panasonic phone set , but , this set never dies ! my family talked hours single charge left handset few interesting places , only found again paging system plenty battery life . 2 hours talk time , it still shows two bars . voice quality not best , but , it not bad either . i use vonage no one tell i'm not traditional line . it definately better than any 2.4 ghz phones out there . range more than i need so i can't complain it . i go corner my back yard opposite side house base station experience minimal static . i've gone so far walk end our street ( cul de sac ) still enough coverage carry conversation , although it weak signal point . overall , i would given phone 5 stars if i didn't provide my own batteries make it useable .	1

we received leadsinger kit last christmas really enjoyed it lot . my family ages : 50 year old dad ( me ) , 44 year old wife/mom , 12 year old son 9 year old daughter . everybody even more fun since getting " classic rock " cartridge because we know lot more songs original vinyl or cd recording reference when we want . only real drawback i think this , or any other " leadsinger " collections there no " master index " songs which tabulates all their collections . this would really help find what you looking , especially if you don't know classification leadsinger uses song . instance , it " classic rock " or hit " 90 " ? one other thing leadsinger could ( this minor ) package plastic case cartridge . cartridges small , not same size any other similar item ( e.g. digital camera flash cards ) , you no place store these leadsinger if your leadsinger mic full cartridges . fun	1
first , let me say i could not review this product completely it quit working after 20 scans ( 30 minutes after charging it first time ) . i chance perform scans 100 , 200 , 400 dpi well black white , 12- 24-bit color . i also able install software import 10 scans into my computer . it scan photos well ( both 200 400 dpi ) , but it tough get images scan perfectly vertical . higher resolution higher color ( 24 bit ) , scanning process took long ( 12 seconds full page ) . when scanning 200 dpi 12-bit color it took 8 seconds per page . also , scanner actually turns off after each scan , thus it takes 15-20 seconds button pushing reboot device before scanning page . importing 7 images device my laptop ( while it still working ) took 4 minutes . ocr software ( paperport ) good , but scan quality ( black white 100 dpi ) too poor allow it functional . 8mb internal memory not enough 128mb or 256mb expansion card definitely needed . what i most shocking very poor craftsmanship . there seams device where plastic glued . one two main buttons recessed into device . also , indicator lights misaligned overlying symbols . i cannot emphasize enough how poorly made this . i am returning it full refund ( 30 day money back 90 day exchange - if bought planon ) . not buy this product ! addendum ( april 20th 2006 ): i very difficult time dealing planon company . return this product within first 30 days get full refund , you must first get authorization which required no fewer than 7 phone calls 5 e-mails . once i finally returned it , they said they credited my charge when they never . upon calling them they said it would " take some time " see credit come through ... 6 weeks ago . they not return phone calls or e-mails order return this it required alot time effort . there business practices ( product quality , customer service , return policy ) poor best . i re-emphasize : not buy this product	-1

aluminum alloy way if you want avoid fan cooling your hard-drive . this well design very sleeks looking case . i seen lacie other external hard drive manufactures using acomdata case . firewire usb 2.0 more compatible older laptop like mine , which only use firewire slow usb 1.1 . yes there on/off switch , which some external too cheap put . there plastic grill front let air through . very easy setup big screws . one issue i noticed since using this case sound insulation . i got noisy seagate hard-drive slim aluminum case no sound insulation , which quiet loud time . my old western digital plastic case quieter hard-drive . so sound level not all fan , it also include hard-drive mechanics . overall it good buy .	1

i recently went through thorough research new phone system , going through research test purchases . main criteria : 1 ) good sound quality ( most decent cost ones okay ) 2 ) very good handset speakerphone quality ( can't stress how important this me , how different quality among brands/handsets ) 3 ) work voicemail ( like sunrocket ) message waiting indicator . if system answering machine it can't voicemail message indicator light . most other features pretty common across models/brands . battery life okay not great most 5.8 ghz systems . best phone i've 900mhz dss sanyo bought 1997 , but they stopped making or selling us . i wasn't looking cheap upto point price wasn't concern . winner : uniden 9465 . any uniden 5.8 ghz digital systems using tcx905 handset same , just different feature sets . i tried panasonic 5.8 ghz high end system , pretty close , handset speakerphone quality slightly worse decider . talking callerid seems like great idea but hopelessly badly implemented panasonic systems . talks too late , after 2 rings taks nonsensically most time . i'm getting classco 9900cw box see how it works . new uniden dect phone build quality atrocious . ge dect phone ( walmart ) horrible . didn't try others , including motorola	1

look price up there . this calculator sophisticated number-crunching gizmo handle 99% standard calculator use . need feature that not available ? good news , this fella programmable . it powers itself freely available light , but yet battery when lighting conditions paltry . its interface lovely thoughtfully conceived , it weighs less than your checkbook , it surprisingly durable : throw it around , let your aunt marge step it , rub it beef give it dog while ... end it'll still work . all , it costs less than pizza . back 1972 , hewlett packard released their hp-35 calculator ( four standard arithmetic functions twelve transcendental functions ) , it cost $395 . don't forget inflation , because translates roughly $2100 2007 . calculator changed world , now here calculator leaves hp-35 dust -- terms speed functionality -- less than 1/100th cost . sure , there lots feature-rich calculators you buy check-out line walgreen only few bucks , so you're probably wondering what makes this calculator so special . if you consider ( ) its price , ( ) its feature set , ( ) its overall utility , this calculator currently apex , folks . * long * way . its there several years . speaking calculator snob , i'm usually unimpressed anything less than classic hp , but far complete package goes , this calculator surprisingly beautiful . i own two them ; one keep my bookbag , one " just case " . this guy , you're getting lot bang very few bucks . it might not graph , it might not perform symbolic math , it might not use rpn or precision-engineered keypad double-injection-molded keys -- above all it certainly not computer -- but it currently best value out there utility scientific calculators nothing else comes close .	1
i really liked this unit ( its transmitter unit twin ) , but only long it actually worked . it works well sending signal my tivo living room my office , where i tv monitor audio running through decent sound system computer . i really like capability use tivo remote office . however , after few months , both transmitter units i've bought died .

i purchased this radio week ago disappointed poor reception . my case , am reception poor . fm reception , built antenna ok , but , radio not go digital unless it strong signal . i recommend antenna like . crane ' fm reflect ' . after i connected crane antenna , fm better than my component fm receiver similar antenna . i am now receiving most all los angeles stations ( 45 miles away ) good digital reception . some stations offer three digital channels , i get those . kenedit added : i connected " terk technology am-1000 advantage passive am indoor antenna " this radio able get standard am reception up quality my other radios . note connecting antenna , connections appear polarized . if you get poor reception terk then switch wires around . sound quality even standard am best i heard any table top radio .	1
optical cable airport express makes huge difference sound quality when compared analog cable comes it . now i barely tell difference playing cd my stereo versus playing through airport express . it makes complete sense why cable would sound far superior : signal received computer airport express digital , if signal travels through analog cable it converted analog , thus losing some quality . optical cable lets digital signal continue all way through your stereo receiver . if you currently airport express hooked up your stereo , yourself favor upgrade cable , just make sure you optical input jack your stereo before buying it	1

i recently puchased this phone replace older uniden cordless phone . i've overall pleased uniden phones our home , so i didn't hesitate buy this one , especially since i difficult time finding white phone this price range didn't answering machine . i'm pleased quality reception . i've none clicking or static other reviewers experienced . sound rather clear . example , my husband called me today his cell phone rural upstate michigan , reception uniden phone excellent . ring volume tone good not annoying . my only complaint phone although it made go wall , it look bit strange . i bought this phone my kitchen , wall mount rather high up wall ( 6 feet ) . phone base small , so it doesn't cover entire mount like my old uniden . result , i only attach phone top hook mount not both mounting hooks , so i make sure it stays straight manually . also , it actually sits cradle , so phone base juts out wall . it not hazard our house , but it visually taking some adjustment could problem if your mount lower wall . also , my last uniden phone came normal phone cord short phone cord wall mounting . note this phone not come short cord . ** update ** - we've now this phone 4 months , i can't wait get rid it . if i talk it more than few minutes , sound receiver goes almost all way out so i can't hear other person talking . then it come back , go out , etc . we love our other uniden phone , but we're definitely getting rid this asap	1

i owned this projector almost year half . let start pros : its projector . it projects . i am using it 9.5 ft screen my bedroom . thats it section . now onto cons : within month , dvd player stopped recognizing any type media placed it ( dvd , dvd-r , cd ) . it not load . i own alternate dvd-player , i just hooked one up ignored problem , hoping would end my difficulties ( shipping back company repair comes out my pocket , eventhough its under warranty , not " television " watch period wasn't beneficial ) . next issue came head 8 months after purchase when turning it one day , motor ran very loudly ( noise-level you speak almost yell when sitting beside person which you conversing ) . color also seemed off ( reds appear muddy brown , image much darker without variating tones , i.e. naturally high contrast ) . this more than takes thrill out watching bloody horror flix . only source reduced buzz when using it computer monitor , but this still very loud , especially start-up . since then , this only way i watch my movies , through dvd-rom my computer projecting horrible image wall . my computer speakers also provide much better sound than built-in system speakers , which very necessary use order hear anything over loud buzzing ( if you close your eyes , you would think it chainsaw)the picture itself also very dim . i two narrow windows my room , both mini-blinds curtain , yet it still difficult daytime watch anything isn't bright cartoon . ( back my love horror movies , this causes dilemma)finally after saving up enough money purchase replacement , i am epson powerlight 76c shipped me . hopefully this projector last longer than optoma . i highly recommend researching other projectors before buying this one . just because it built dvd-player , don't let win you over . it just easy hook-up external dvd-player better projector . i purchased this 9.5 ft screen home shopping network 2200$ . talk pricey ! next time i won't so hasty purchase anything . this piece junk . try epson powerlight 96c . i researched read many good things this projector . it costs less , lumens 2000 , 1000 more than optoma , meaning you watch dark movies during day . hook up your own cheap $20 dvd-player . i guarantee you even cheapest dvd-players last longer than this system built-in one . go quality not cheap hooks	-1

i purchased this agp run 3d software occasionally not really games . i updated bios , directx , video drivers before installing card loading it support software . manual general manual wasn't specific my card . it recommend exiting hardware wizard running ati install . amount software installed overwhelming unnecessary . all you need catalyist drivers . not file player , all-in-one-wonder , remote-wonder , multimedia library , unless you plan watch tv pc . ( i don't ) . card no fan but large heat sink . i sempron 3100+ 1 gb ram , additional cooling fans 300 watts . all system shutting down overheating . i lessen resolution refresh rate no avail . card showed rich cooler built 3d configuration , pc check screen savers worked no problem . but just doing web surfing , playing quicktime , running 3d screensaver causes overheating . no games . video payback choppy . my onboard video came motherboard outperformed card but can't run 3d . test , card couldn't run even most basic 3d game demo even it lowest detail settings . i returned card after . overheating shutdowns went away . it maybe great card larger systems but budget system it performance killer . it overheating issues . support software little prevent system crashes .	1

i given zune gift , recently . this isn't first mp3 player i've owned but it one largest capacity store data i've owned . up front i'll tell you i'm not hardcore ipod junkie , nor am i apple kiss-butt . i believe products work . said i see why people prefer ipod over zune , though i say zune isn't deserving some bashing i've read these boards people who believe it cool bash microsoft products just because they made microsoft . good1 . zune large , bright lcd screen easily seen sunlight . video picture quality good . 2 . sound quality good . factory earphones adequate delivering music though i pair philips earphones far superior only cost $20.3 . box includes data cable you need syncing . 4 . interface super easy use it easy get around zune environment i've not any music skipping problems 1.3 firmware automatically downloaded when i synced my pc . 5 . unit itself feels solid when held , slightly heavy though not too heavy . 6 . software loaded without problem my winxp sp2 system i no problem syncing machine when connected usb port rear pc . i all my non-itunes songs added player within minutes . 7 . zune allows you beam songs , pictures movies other zune players range . first generation player , it gets job nicely i look forward seeing what generation 2 bring . not so good1 . when i connected zune 4 port usb hub pc didn't recognize it there . i connect it back pc usb 2.0 port order get it work . maybe that design , though i'm not sure . once i this i no syncing problems all . 2 . i've never found zune range share anything . leaving wireless seems drain battery faster . i'd recommend turning this feature off until more people buy zune ( if happens ) . 3 . you can't buy music or movies wirelessly . 4 . although zune wireless it not compatible your home or business wireless lan . 5 . you can't browse internet zune . 6 . zune software no problem getting your music onto device , though zune marketplace vastly understocked compared itunes music store . 7 . zune cannot get music purchased through itunes ( this nitpicky , i know , but would so nice ) . there way work around this - you burn your itunes songs disc then turn around rip disc pc mp3s then import them zune , which i would rather than pay money re-purchase music i've already bought once . 8 . there no way re-organize files your zune once they uploaded device . say example i want throw couple pictures into picture folder so when i view my pics i don't scroll down forever day see them . i delete pic zune through pc software , add pic folder i want then sync pc player . folder added zune library order update occur . 9 . there no way change orientation photos or movies when viewed . i would like able flip them counterclockwise or clockwise 90 degrees view them portrait view instead turning player its side view landscape mode . one reason why this important when i set one my pics my zune background , i'd like able see just how much pic cut off since zune doesn't resize pic fit . oh yeah , that thing ... 10 . pics used zune background don't option re-sized fit screen . what i would like see change zune ( more microsoft than anyone else)1 . options re-sizing pics fit zune screen2 . options changing orientation pics movies3 . ability organize my files zune without delete file re-sync . i'd like able this player software both . 4 . since i use usb port back my pc longer sync cable would nice . 5 . put built-in wireless good use . slap compact internet explorer allow viewing web pages email ! you don't need keyboard view read-only content like weather , news sports it would really add player value6 . allow zune able buy music , pics video without connect pc . again , make use wireless capability zune . 7 . something zune marketplace - it just needs overhaul . it needs additional music , movies definite bump cool factor . 8 . make it easier customize outside zune . you this additional customizeable faceplates xbox 360 - same this player . if you hadn't noticed - individuality here stay	1

if you looking ipod alarm system this your machine . reviewer comments good sound quality mark . but it one serious design flaw least how i wanted use it i'm returning mine . i thought it dual ipod/radio alarm system , advertised . it not . radio alarm only second alarm , apparently second sleeper . you cannot select two options . tried work around setting second alarm go off first but you can't not set ipod alarm so when it ( or buzzer ) goes off it shuts down radio . can't understand why they couldn't worked around this issue but beware if you want choice flexibility what you wake .	1

i've this keyboard little over month . i'm college student purchased ppc so i carry my notes important dates , information , etc my pocke t.t ypically , keyboard , intention using ppc notebook , necessary . pro pretty much pinxet mentioned , there not much i add . however his cons somewhat ... insulting intelligence hp customers . bt_kb comes off button . same button you use turn it turns it off . further experiment this , if you press it once , establish connection ipaq then press button second time pop-up appear informing you keyboard disconnected . also , if you press button twice then your ipaq search it , it not find i t.t he little lock keep keyboard flat , pinxet mentioned , useless . " / " button ( also " ? " ) curiously placed right shift ( normal qwerty keyboard it left shift ) . so if you use forward-slash or question mark frequently you adjust your writing get used unusual position key . ( where " / " would normally you fingers type up-arrow key . so what ultimately ends up happening , when you want type question mark , you hold down shift , press up , highligh one line text continue typing removing line text . fortunately ipaq word processor comes undo function . ) my only other concern i seem problems connecting keyboard my cell phone . phone identifies keyboard establishes connection , but beyond i can't seem get keyboard type anything . students anyone intending use ppc pc ( perhaps pocket laptop ) , this keyboard priceless . i use it four five times day . ( such , i would highly recommend purchasing two pairs rechargable batteries it . next time maybe hp built lithium battery , like all other accessories electronics	1

i've my pmc-120 little over 1 month am pretty happy it . there few features microsoft could improved : user customizeable eq , more than one playlist created device , last playlist recall when returning music ( video or tv ) . overall unit functions well great taking all my media road me . once windows media player configured my pc , all my synchronized recorded tv content converted background before i wake up morning . before i leave , i just plug sync minute or so i'm good go . only other nit-pick i would processor or i/o performance seems issue when loading album cover tracks . example , if i change next track increase volume , volume response take 2 - 3 seconds while album cover loaded . this little irritating sometimes when i want skip through several tracks . spite this , i like unit i'm happy it . maybe ms/iriver provide firmware update address lack features above	1

i just needed small inexpensive radio good stereo headphone jack listen work better reception than my iriver music player this guy fit bill perfectly . amazon carries suprisingly few compact fm radios digital tuning aren't garbage . no matter , this exactly what i needed . reception far better than my music player , even antenna unextended , battery life phenomenal . i've this few months , listening it average few hours week i am still my first pair batteries . my only complaint it others noted , tuner volume knobs hyper-sensitive . full range volume barely audible too loud occurs over like eighth rotation knob . fine tuning stations chore because it go 101.10 mhz 101.15 mhz pretty much just breathing it ( it 0.05 mhz digital tuning resolution ) . since tuning knob side , it gets budged slighly every time you remove it included sleeve so you need re-fine-tune it receive your station everytime you take it sleeve which gets kind frustrating . overall quality radio many features belie its low price . four stars based its fm tuner capability alone	1
excellent price ! tiny 1gb holds lot music , pictures documents . just click drag . fast data transfer speed . super-easy use . lanyard keeps it ready .	1
this amazing value . i all set purchase same system ebay when i checked amazon . not only price low any listing auction site , but it included shipping no cos t.t he system very well packed . someone put lot thought into getting this product china my house without damage . setup breeze . no need get your kids show you how connect speakers . well thought out . calibration process using enclosed microphone positively excellen t.t he sound overall very good . probably not up bose , but then consider cost differential . my one complaint disk changer . loading more than one disk verrrry slow . so slow i thought system defective . drag out kid figure it out . this why i gave it 4 stars instead 5 . cocolalla , idah	1
first thing i noticed this item great audio quality although i using same old speakers my car . i originally got his item so i connect it ipod adapter which works flawlessly although i would loved see search feature added . overall , this great model i recommend it highly .	1

when shopping external storage , i wanted something not only provided lot gb my dollar , but would also provide redundancy . after all , external hard drive no more reliable than internal drive your computer , i've far too many hard drive crashes lost data it happen again . this device perfect combination . raid 1 configuration , each unit two disk drives contains exact copy data , so if one fails you need only replace one drive rest easy , because data safely stored secondary disk . i also read western digital send out replacement drive so you replace it yourself , eliminating need send your precious remaining drive some factory somewhere . just keep mind this configuration , you only 500 gb storage since both disks contain same data . i also wanted triple interface . i couple macs firewire 400 ports , i pc usb 2.0 . someday if i buy newer mac it may firewire 800 , this external drive ready them all . it took only minute install software my mac book pro , most time spent doing reboot ( unfortunate drawback , first time i've ever reboot after installing new software ) . noise : there lot negative comments noise , but considering all benefits i went ahead took plunge . boy am i pleased decision ! there brief power-up fan noise when device first connected power , but after it whisper quiet . i type this review , i'm middle moving 20 gb old files drive there no noise whatsoever . there few drawbacks too . marketing literature promotes unit capacity meter built into led indicator . you must drive connected computer driver installed this feature work , making it mostly worthless my case ( where i connect multiple computers , some no drivers installed ) . sometimes drive goes sleep upon long period inactivity , takes 5-10 seconds wake again . this minor annoyance , but nowhere near deal breaker . here my positives negatives : pros- great amount storage price- raid 1 means no more lost data- wd offers advance replacement failed disks- triple interface offers excellent flexibility- whisper quiet , aside brief power-on fan noisecons- capacity meter mostly useless- drive sleeps long inactivity wakes slowlyconclusionoverall i would highly recommend this drive anyone looking external storage built redundancy great price . i feel 100% confident knowing my data properly mirrored digital content ( which i invested money ) also safe years come	1

i just took over 500 pictures this camera while i trip europe . i learned lot it process . it some nice features : it lightweight , durable , easy plug remove zaurus , it really impresses people . you store thousands pictures 480x320 resolution , or ten thousand 128mb sd card . downside , it drains battery quickly , picture quality varies so-so fairly bad . camera unusually picky lighting level - it poorly low light , also poorly mixed bright/dark lighting . if you get lighting right , it take " acceptable " pictures . if you're kind person cares picture quality , you're not going like output much . if you're like me , just taking [ inexpensive ] pictures stick your homepage , it works like charm . i'm glad i bought it	1
