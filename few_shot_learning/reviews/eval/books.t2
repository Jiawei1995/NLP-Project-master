casual book browsers who stumble across braden book , " isaiah effect , " might undoubtedly drawn implications title : there exists some mystical , unifying code which only now fully understood through modern techniques , research , understanding . i , one such browser , briefly read so-called " bible code " which computers now enabled man explore thought subject this book might related . my interest piqued title book description , i delved into pages expecting learn exactly what encompassed isaiah " precise instructions " prayer . i wanted know exactly what braden claimed stumbled upon . what i found this 250 page foray into countless subjects nothing other than pastiche new-thought concepts . mixing religions , example - sort pick-and-choose spirituality which slowly creeping its way into mainstream decades - recycled over over again , drawing endless sources gnostic gospels other lost books . only one chapter braden actually begin describe detail verses book isaiah . instead he relegates books essenes positions higher authority prominence . brief pages which braden actually discuss isaiah , his conclusions speak nothing decoded lost science . his basic premise " effect " people alter their futures choices they make present . such revelation not new interpretation isaiah all . any student bible christianity knows all prophetic books old testament records god warning israel , world , turning away him . braden credit , his discussions effects prayer today society commemorable , albeit somewhat misguided . i agree him people today society need turn away petty details life which they've surrounded themselves . however , i believe braden over-emphasizes role feelings emotion prayer . he fails discuss how humans , their emotions , extremly fallable change quickly winds his anecdotes . braden wants desperately believe true power prayer found all lost science which he uncovered ancient texts . process he fails recognize blueprint prayer known man ever since he created . humbleness before god filling holy spirit true keys prayer - not cosmic emotions human feelings . disappointing read	1
refreshing look software development many pitfalls you need avoid . this book should read everybody involved any software project but simplest . my opinion , standard work . nevertheless , it needs handled care . during ages , sw development managers tried convincing their people break out chaos , plan their work . this book correctly warns opposite effects believing planning solves everything . some people might however read lines no planning all best practice . book confirms what i my successful colleagues found through experience intuition : there optimal point planning upfront . less harms because you don't know where you going , more ( too detailed ) harms because it takes away flexibility it slows you down significantly . new me use queuing theory point out what we see every day : too many features , under-resourcing leads far bigger delays than human mind ever guess .	1

it doesn't sound like people you list reasons " not " read this book , actually read " this " book . there big difference , my opinion , putting positive affirmations your mind , versus witch doctor . quite honestly , it seems positive affirmations could should used " conjuction " medical care . it say anywhere book forego medical care , because you most definitely healed ? no where . so my opinion , one " sound " mind , not view book " cure all " all ills life , but rather positive way " enhance " your life . it just plain stupid avoid getting medical care , when you terminal illness , or any other illness matter . but according what i gather book , you use positive affirmations , " believe " you getting well , help keep yourself positive state , rather than filling your head negative thinking you never get well . studies aside this book proven healthy positive attitude mental outlook , wonders recovering patients , their medical care . your review not address any those people read this book , because two examples people you list , it apparent they didn't read book either , ( not sure what compelled you post here ? ) therefore you not qualified , my opinion , critique this book , they using apparently some form faith healing televangelist , they prescribe drinking snakes blood , too ? anyway , this book no way says forgo medical treatment if you sick , those , probably won't addressing their medical problem . positive affirmations power suggestion help you through your medical crisis ? i imagine it , ( studies prove it ) addition proper medical treatment . anyway , you might want actually read book , instead making comments what happened " so so " who didn't even read it or apply it , including yourself .	1

i didn't especailly high hopes this book . i think there gradual decline quality hh books over years , this one brings it new low . basically , it waaaaaay too long . 850 pages , it monster read , slow one . that not always bad thing - sometimes if you like characters it nice just hang out your friends page after page . but not here . why it necessary describe detail exact movements treecat using sign language ? several paragraphs ? more than once ? why we given pages liturgy religious services ? i think i'd very small minority when i confess i quite like 1662 prayer book , though i can't quite work out why it would revived distant future when it out use here decades ! maybe it easy cut paste , got word count up . then there space combat - strength series , especially first three or four . but there rub - there only so many ways you describe spaceship blowing up . 11th book series i can't only person out there whose eyes beginning glaze over when we get battle sequences . but big problem - spoiler alert ! - way which weber solves love triangle we left last book . honor loves hamish . emily loves hamish . hamish loves honor emily . what ? it turns out there easy solution . after 400 pages agonising ( not mention most previous book ) it seems honor marry them both . bit outre ? seemingly not - apparently such arrangements fall well within accepted norms manticoran law custom . ( although we've never whiff this before . ) but what really gets me reason it didn't happen halfway through last book ( get this ) , gosh , o-o ne thought it . it seems o-o ne ever told mr weber if you shoot someone gun act , gun better hanging wall act i . all-in-all , i only say , please mr weber . it time bring series end . please it soon	-1

this marvelous volume enjoyed book photography lovers alike . object its own right it exhibits level refinement conception execution become rare our age mass-produced books . course , there many specialist photobook publishers but they seem focus exclusively print quality increase perceived value their publications , whilst neglecting vital contribution design book overall appearance ( desirability ) . phaidon-volume , exquisitely judged rhythm layout typography complement vivid reproductions vintage photobook material into very exciting whole . sure , care spent production this book not gratuitous . contrary , it statement reinforces basic conceptual tenets held badger parr . introductory pages we learn not every any book conceived around collection photographs merits included class " photobooks " . photobook - badger parr understand it - more than just sum its parts : pictures , words , design , choice subject all contribute something which transcends meaning photographic portfolio . this all illuminating one could certainly say " photobook " instructive example this synergy various elements . however , i wished editorial team would left it . i think badger parr moving onto much more controversial ground when they hold forth emblematic photobook kind dramatic event , " comparable piece sculpture , play or film " which individual photographs lose their own character things themselves . apart theoretically doubtful , i believe this criterion simply too stringent many vintage photobooks featured this survey not comply it . example , many early books photo albums true sense word : bound collections original prints glued onto white pages . similarly , it difficult see some modernist books - such erhardt " das watt " or mendelsohn " amerika " - anything more than expertly produced photographic portfolio . each these examples there coherence , but it not derive some kind dramatic or narrative logic . it simply unity style which holds photobook together . positioning photobook " novel film " , therefore , raises more questions than it provides us answers . it doesn't really help make sense " ragged sprawling subject , more than its fair share anomalies " . it perhaps more useful investigate how badger parr tried organise their material within confines this volume ( next ) . they seem relied three different lines thought . first chronological ( it history after all ) . survey starts very first publications , early history photography end section " photobook modern life " . this sense , book studied remarkably lively varied panorama how photographers engaged their craft over last 150 years . second organising principle geographical : some individual chapters focus distinct area cultural production ( us , europe japan ; next volume features chapter " worldwide photobook " ) . finally , there " intention " structuring element . photobooks produced serve variety purposes : tell story , tell non-story ( stream-of-consciousness-like books ) , non-tell story ( deconstruct ) , document , persuade , etc . indeed , valuable photobook even limit itself simply showing . most chapters two volumes put some kind " intention " center discussion . i think badger parr conception their own book certain extent odds their conceptual emphasis dramatic nature photobooks . if there drama " photobook " , it mediated words accompany various chapters , not visuals . other words : it conceptual not photographic narrative unfolds . regards visuals , curiously enough daring use white space drop shadows around book page reproductions really make them stand out preciously unique . leafing through book akin walking carefully presented museum exhibits . this sense , " photobook " clearly `shows ' , therefore pulls us away dramatic sweep history . despite these theoretical misgivings there not shade doubt my mind this book deserves five stars . it fabulous book i look forward keen anticipation second final volume .	1

i imagine my mind what it would like coffee luis borges sunday afternoon . borges would wearing suit little cakes hand , cane leaning his armrest , if nothing out ordinary occur . labyrinths useful first book kick off lifetime investigation into borges ' writings . borges truly original author much his intent his achieving it . not quite magic realist , not quite existentialist nor kafkan : no one borges ' equal taking established assumptions turning them into curious , elaborate , eruditely-supported flashing crossroads defy simplification . even most unassuming essays like " fearful sphere pascal , " subtle historical resketching , characteristically erudite , yet sticky complicate subject irresistibly your first reading onward . prickly thorns reach out your existing education subject designed flesh out glaring inconsistencies you read subjec t.t he garden forking paths example prime borges storytelling work . story itself ruse . first reading-through not time you affected most borges , but rather only after you put book down , when borges ' physics begin gnaw your world compact , necessary daily conveniences , even 2005 when we really ought intimately familiar his universe now . i think ultimately borges sets tiny mind bombs set detonate exactly time you seek superimpose newtonian universe upon one his stories , ultimately , later , when you seek superimpose order upon your own human experience . entrance seems same , but it clearly moved time you exit story . you become part puzzle , bedazzling signature borges , his unassailable virtue . everything solid universe daily lived experience becomes compost peacefully unsettled , it originally , before we came fix it up like morticians just before funeral .	1

david mills ' " atheist universe " lucid presentation rationalist viewpoint nature our world how it explained without resorting mysticism unprovable assertions supreme . it , mills carefully lays out reasons why we needn't assume existence god ( or gods ) understand natural phenomena , demolishes numerous assertions teachings religious spiritualist propagandists . his primary target christian fundamentalism , but he makes it clear his critique religious beliefs equally applicable other faiths well . places , his explanations get bit technical , but he fine job demolishing pseudo-scientific mumbo-jumbo used " intelligent design " crowd their fellow travelers . ( chapter internet porn , however , seems out place . yes , biggest porn-bashers often religious conservatives -- but so what ? what validity atheist viewpoint ? )one thing i particularly enjoyed numerous quotes past present thinkers mills includes throughout book . among those he cites albert einstein , thomas jefferson , thomas edison mark twain - numerous others whose writings i long admired . " atheist universe " probably won't convert many diehard religious believers , but if you all open-minded , qualms endless barrage religiosity engulfing america today , this book well worth buying reading	1

read several different translations lysistrata , i report one you select may make all difference your opinion this early comedy . roche translation very vulgar but good footnotes : get ready cockney spartans , however . jack lindsay translation , 1925 ( included bantam edition aristophanes ) seems overly literary comparison original but lacks notes . it reads well , though sounds little old-fashioned . bawdry present but made less direct ; this one spartan dialect scottish . i found parker translation least satisfactory . " hillbilly " dialect he gives spartans painfully overdone , not mention inaccurate , speeches awkward pedestrian . excellent edition overall alan . sommerstein penguin classic " aristophanes : lysistrata other plays . " introduction notes extremely informative , translation itself strikes right note represent aristophanes ' style english . ( once again , though , spartans scots . ) but perhaps best choice sarah ruden 2003 edition . her dialogue unusually funny without straying too far original . added value comes her four very readable essays greek democracy , warfare , women , comedy . it also printed quality paper comes great cover	1
david mamet one america most respected playwrights . this autobiographical essay jewish situation he writes wild passion outrage hatred jews unjustly subject , flight shame their own jewish identity good part american jewry . he starts out cry , ' world hates jews ' this becomes kind rhythmic chant all through his opening chapter , sense throughout work whole . revealed first shortcoming this work . while it true jews suffered historically hatred persecution most horrible ways , it true this very time historically jewish state israel subject continuous barrage hatred many sources it not true each every person nation hates jews israel . here i fault mamet allowing his rhetoric get best him unknowingly insulting not simply great share his fellow countrymen who actually sympathize allied israel but so many remarkable human beings who ' friends ' jews throughout history . moreover mamet not seem realize when one makes such claim one really work one enemies , one distances implication , friends seems invite others hatred jews . this qualification made i come what i regard strongest point mamet work , his pointing out biased discriminatory treatment state israel not only haters , islamists , neo- nazis , radical left chomskyians , but great share world nations media who continually show bias , discrimination towards jewish state . mamet here provides few recent pieces evidence back up his claim , but perhaps would better he focused present iranian regime talk ' wiping ' israel map- stressed too point this kind unprecedented declaration one u.n. state upon not met worldwide outrage sanction iranian mullah-regime . mamet second major subject assimilated , self- denying apologetic american jews , wicked son his title , who not simply resist jewish belonging but often curry favor others even join chorus hatred against jewish religion , jewish community , state israel . mamet i sense criticizes many what he somewhat misleadingly calls ' apikorsim ' their detachment jewish life , one senses it almost if he trying shame them back jewish belonging . it almost if whole book kind ' teshuvah riff ' which he reaching out assimilated jews urging them abandon their ' inauthenticity ' courageously take new interest pride their jewish identities . mamet celebrates importance ' belonging ' talks how it give greatest pleasure life . here he apparently referring his own return jewish observance kind communal experiences he under tutelage his own spiritual mentor , rabbi finley . here too i think great force passion mamet lead him bit exaggeration , we know nothing more evil than intoxications given mindless group- belonging . any case mamet specific recommendation return real jewish belonging through observance me both commendable incomplete . it not enough i understand it jew today world bound communal religious observance . additional necessity i understand it jewish historical awareness understanding well beyond kind character mamet reveals himself this work . i agree wholeheartedly his call renewed jewish communal belonging , identity contribution but i believe this broader conception ' jewish identity ' than one mamet provides us this work . i think however most important point mamet heart right place . he uses his extraordinary literary talents make not always carefully argued but most often emotionally convincing wake- up call american jews	1

( this part added 1952 ) . me book really took story two halves . first half book , parts 1 2 , bulk theory really laid out . it slow going it extremely depth but i highly recommend you stick it this pays off second half book ! part 3 mises really starts putting flesh onto theory when we get into money banking proper discussion demand money , credit , fiduciary paper , rate interest etc . but towards end chapters 19 20 things get much more interesting equilibrium rates interest discussed detail he finally talks gold , gold standard banking freedom . part 4 where my heart lies . here we discussion principles sound money versus contemporary currency systems . there then excellent discourse return sound money , ie classical gold standard . second half this wonderful book certainly flowed better me , but may also just because i am more investment manager/trader less economist ! you feel like you mises teaching you fine detail he left no stone unturned your understanding . mises doesn't read easily prose rothbard but not detract excellence material . superb ! it really truly outstanding work if not best book ever written subject , it surely very least , one very best , such certainly " must-read " !!! this wonderful , beautifully bound , classic absolute " steal " $20 . i still cannot believe it sold so little . my recommendation buy it while it still available this beautiful hardbound edition ! enjoy	1

his first novel , julian fellowes ( gosford park-screenwriting fame ) created gift all anglophiles who fascinated wealth , title , privilege . everyone who eagerly consumes british television , film , books ; everyone who ever dreamed owning english country estate part aristocracy , fellowes " dishes dirt " fictional form , meticulously describing how other " half " lives , particularly how they go delineating who who not part their tribe . fact , mr. fellowes goes into such careful detail social mores upper crust times it drags down narrative pace . firs t-t ime novelist i think fellowes falls into trap doing too much " telling " not enough " showing " . problem this book ending not feel " piece " everything went before . overall tone novel more wharton than wodehouse , but ending more wodehouse than wharton . this would five-star book if tone consistent beginning end . my final issue novel fellowes ' habit sprinkling text french phrases , which begins feel like he consciously aligning himself upper crust he describing distancing himself his more plebeian audience . this gets bit tiresome novel end . outlined what i feel problems novel , i point out i nevertheless enjoyed it . there voyeuristic appeal reading foibles class most us never rub shoulders , there wryly amusing moments sprinkled throughout . pace drags times , but you find yourself wanting see how it all works out end . i look forward reading future novels mr. fellowes	1

let freedom ring , sean hannity sends out subliminal message he his writing truth , justice , american way . just title represents everything true good him america . his five-star reviewers his message reinforces their pre-conceived beliefs hannity words validation those beliefs . if this written ghost writer , he should withheld payment . if it wasn't written ghostwriter , hannity should one his next attempt literary hyperbole . first chapter written maudlin , " those-were-the-good-old-days " wistfulness his immigrant grandfather who he describes honest man integrity , believer american dream . but before you say " erin go braugh " he talking courage george . bush standing up terrorism . exactly how g.w. , he doesn't elaborate . how he goes grandfather dubbya bit magic . hannity next trick impugn clinton gore soft terrorism . his source this , all people , dick morris who knew clintons now works fox republican advocacy network . he quotes morris who makes such vague statements " it seemed they afraid talking terrorism , " or " they seemed indifferent terrorism . " these " morris mind-reads " conjectural , but hannity uses them , which he impunity . let take closer look hannity unimpeachable source moment . it dick morris who quit clintons shortly after second election . it morris who penchant streetwalkers , some jail time , entered alcohol rehab . you'd think sh could find better source if he expects freedom ring ! but , hannity doesn't skip beat . he points out how democrats such senators kerry daschle voted against certain defense-spending bills . what he neglects inform his readers reasons they because riders attached bills , or number republicans who also voted against same bills , or many defense bills kerry daschle vote . he never once advises his reader defense spending programs killed dick cheney when he secretary defense . such deception called propaganda . propaganda something hannity no compunction using here . this he continuing tell tale long since debunked . namely , it story president clinton offered osama bin laden sudanese government . again , it what he doesn't say misdirects reader . sudan made offer hope economic sanctions against them slave-trading , lifted . however , fbi determined sudanese playing us because they neither ability nor intent handing over bin laden . sudanese also made offer saudi arabia , but saudis revoked bin laden citizenship , refused take him . benjamin franklin said " statistics liar . " hannity uses charts same purpose . he shows how under reagan , army bought over 500 tanks . under clinton , army bought none . this leads one assumption clinton nothing services . he doesn't mention army buys tanks , not presidents . he doesn't mention army all tanks they needed armored warfare against soviet union never came . he doesn't mention army began changing its warfare strategies which would include more transportable fighting vehicles . grateful hannity cannot rewrite famous works literature he attempts history . if he could , instead seeing dead captain ahab killed whale " moby dick , " we might just see grinning captain standing next tethered whale caption : " i caught fish this big ! " there something very fishy his facts , his historical parallels which aren't parallel , what he chooses tell you , what he chooses leave out . this book , he tells whale-sized whoppers !	-1

( so if 25 year cycle continues , then it only 8 years or so until next dune/hyperion sci-fi novel . ) hyperion published before ubiquitous presence internet . just give idea what it like then , it time logging into internet very first time one life conversations such : `ok first type http ' , `why ' , `just it make sure it http not hhtp or htpp ok then type colon backslash backslash make sure it backslash not forward slash ' , `a what-slash what there two types slashes ... who thinks these things ' , `and make sure you type two backslashes ' , `why two why not three or four ' , `just type it ' , `ok now type three w ' , `oh so * now * we type three continuous characters ' . yes , it amusing time . so this book published before most these conversational interactions , so world web novel takes new meaning re-reading . terms like fatline could taken apple use `fat ' software codes written compatible their older hardware their newer power-pc-chip hardware incorporated into their computers late 80 . so simmons really cutting edge things when he published this novel . like dune , this sweeping epic novel part sweeping epic series . others commented , hyperion/fall hyperion ( foh ) not separate books , they one book split down middle published separately . means it really 1000 page novel . may seem daunting , but serious reader sf , you'll want read this , more importantly it hard believe you wouldn't enjoy reading this . there'll point your life , if not already , where additional $8 insignificant time it takes read this precious , so if you time now then now time . there some novels seem more meaning when read some point one life . this novel me personally takes more meaning now i advanced my career . i identify many characters ; their professionalism , occasion disillusionment , screw-ups , achievements . there things this novel sticks you through years . definitely shrike . ( shrike way actual bird impales worms it caught upon thorns such . ) also ending fall hyperion i remember . ending hyperion/foh , simmons comment destruction maui-covenant , not military action , but tourists `smelling suntan lotion cannibas ' , simmons disillusioned effect quick far ranging travel places unique status human-masses eventual erosion what made location unique . ending he writes certainly work his futuristic universe , but he suggesting parallel event ours ? it we should remove jet engines our collective consciousness' ? this bold comment possible overpopulation our planet , now 6 or 7 or 8.4 billion this time ? this comment this now almost untouchable subject ( overpopulation ) , considerable population increases foreseen not united states or europe but rather asian continent such cities lagos . well maybe not ; maybe it what within united states itself , its hideously ugly ubiquitous strip malls within short distance any region physical beauty . although it unlikely anything change , it may not bad thing hope . considering ending hyperion/foh epic , this may point what he written . 482 pages , published 1989 , 4-1/2 star	1

william cleveland " history modern middle east " without doubt essential book anyone interested or studying middle east history . cleveland presents history region late ottoman empire through more recent struggles dominating airwaves - this most important thing - explains what earth stake . this particularly important thing middle east history , some alliances divisions different groups somewhat arcane beginner . unlike many books covering history region , cleveland writes eminently readable manner . while some readers astonished lack diacritics like , this serves purpose communicating his information much more clearly . his analysis sense history spot-on . whether writing defeat ottoman empire or land-rights struggle palestinians israelis , cleveland presents facts clearly wry sense humour times - particularly his discussion iran modernising drive . cleveland also eye anecdote illuminating personality , which greatly improves his abilities writer . if there one problem lot contemporary middle east scholarship , it reliance dry historical record expense character sketch . if there one criticism which could made this work , it cleveland sometimes expects little more background knowledge his readers than perhaps he should . already interest this field , i not suffer too much this expectation , although absolute beginner might some problems . said , this book i highly recommend anyone keen learn genesis region which - better or worse - looks though it news headlines many years come . after all , winston churchill ( man who not come up roses history this region ) once said , those who not understand history doomed repeat it . arguably , this more true middle east than anywhere else earth	1

john kelly written very complete text possible origin geographical course black plague took it swept through europe middle ages . while covering plague detail , kelly book contains much , much more information than romping ' yersinia pestis ' bacillus . kelly includes lessons history , map study both possible probable courses plague took its journey . i found map quite helpful , book interesting enough i've brushed up my geography now well . kelly includes tales kings , monks , priests , surgeons , wide-spread anti-semitism movement , great famine 1315 . despite rich prose , well written layman language , book remains dry times . flow timeline interrupted lot because kelly tends tell tale region rather than timeline , though two eventually meet shake hands . chapter ten , " god first love " took left turn went off its own into history jewish persecution rather than plague travels , not necessarily boring but enough off topic make me lose interest . while jews seemed unduly persecuted plague times , i question dedication entire chapter jewish history book . pestis . sheer volume information ' great mortality ' makes it one most informative books i've read middle ages , much less plague bacillus , but it also creates more difficult read . this might not book you looking if you wish skim surface black plague history . ' great mortality ' more like diving into deep water than gleaning field . kelly book heavy information , including footnotes , full notes/bibliography section , index . but , its also filled enough imagination intrigue maintain high level interest subject , even laymen . if you any interest plague or even functioning middle ages during adverse conditions such famine or plague , then definitely pick up copy ' great mortality ' . enjoy !	1

" ... so when his reasons making pledge no longer operrative . " we live era high definition television , internet , fast cars , space travel when change word day everything seems become outdated before tomorrow arrives , then you come accross book like this ... you realise there something our nature not changed much . i read book disbelief , amazed how contemporary this text despite fact niccolo machiavelli wrote this book five hundred years ago . machiavelli wrote this book after losing high powered position florentine state . it believed he wrote book 1513 , or least he started working book year . you read text i quoted title my review you cannot escape thought how well applies today politics - any country . quote captures essence book , political manifesto applied practice hundred years later richellieu , creator " raison d'etat " concept . machiavelli focused stating principles acquiring sustaining political power italy . his belief true leader person political abilities , fortune military skills . while sifting through history find examples support his organisation various power systems , machiavelli uses his sharp observations discuss human nature attach them methodically arsenal skills successful prince needs master . thus book becomes something used debate history , politics , human nature , sociology or i dare say economics . this book excellent material people deep belief humans bad they managed mainly through fear : " this said generality men : they ungrateful , fickle , dissembling , anxious flee danger , covetous gain . so long you promote their advantage , they all yours ... " . this lack trust present throughout book machiavelli not discriminate his conclusion classes . poor rich alike when it comes interest . my view , this conundrum machiavelli : he generalises men untrustworthy yet he talks loyalty patriotism , especially when it comes himself . book more than study human nature politics . while reading it i started understand much better italian history . it clear my view why italy so fragmented politics this country so volatile . it goes back hundreds years struggle power influencial families . during this time they become experts diplomacy finding right balance power . i found amazing how papacy managed survive landscape littered stories ruin , deceit , death temporary success . italy battle ground papacy , powerful italian families , french spanish emperors . country lots old memories , i believe , still strong presence today affairs . it interesting machiavelli noted strong pricipality could based strong cities . he uses example german cities strong fortifications , moats artilery " ... they enough work sort mainstay city keep populace engaged their usual crafts space year " . this description economic power , seed future capitalism . i found interesting although he noted importance economic capacity , he missed it list critical elements success , limiting it include only political military . machiavelli principles power politics applied warfare business . he discussess extensively what prince should maintain power when conquering new territories . i worked couple years company aggressive acquirer i say machiavelli observations apply incredibly well many scenarios acquisitions , especially if they hostile . apart mergers acquisitions , some studies human nature revealed when people new leader apply quite well today politics played even department level . there few lessons there . example if new ruler conquers new territory chances preserving territory increase greatly if ruler moves residency new territory . this what turkish sultan preserve greek territory . i find instructive , today terms , follow more closely see if acquiring company high ranking officer moving new territory belonging acquired company . machiavelli master language . he manages express human beliefs touching primitive cord makes you pay attention wonder . he , however , biased too much towards idea humans either evil or greedy or arrogant or stupid . i supose one could forgive considering living conditions he endured when he wrote book . nowadays , he could published same book , cash royalties , make movie , make very comfortable living . here fragment letter he wrote his friend , francesco vettori : " ... meanwhile lunchtime arrives , together my family , i eat whatever food my poor house scanty patrimony afford . lunched , i return inn . there i generally find innkeeper , butcher , miller , two kiln-tenders . their company i idle rest day away playing cricca tricchetrach - games give rise host quarells , cutting remarks , insults . often we fight over penny heard yelling far off san casciano . set down among these lice , this how i keep mould my brain find release fortune malice . i am content her beat me down this way see if she won't become ashamed " great book , worth every penny every minute . served good glass wine , or cup tea quiet environment . get ready surprises , interesting associations intellectual delight .	1

this book dan brown bestseller " da vinci code " based . indeed , michael baigent et.al . even sued brown court , charging him plagiarizing their book . ideas behind " da vinci code " exposed completely bogus many real historians . obviously , this exposure affects " holy blood , holy grail " well . this book methodologically flawed . it claims jesus survived crucifixion sired children mary magdalene . but if this happened , there should ancient documents telling us it . there essentialy only three ancient views jesus : christian , judeo-christian gnostic . none them includes notion jesus married children mary magdalene . it simply isn't serious reject ancient documents favor modern texts questionable value , michael baigent . course , conspiracy theorist might claim ancient documentation lacking due massive cover-up . but such argument , compelling it may sound , worthless historian , who must work real evidence , meager it may . claim neither proven or disproven little help . besides , how many sects or cults managed keep their esoteric secrets ? very few indeed . there always defector or infiltrator somewhere . idea biggest secret all times revealed confused french right-wing extremist only 40 years ago very hard take seriously . indeed , fact not even heretical groups like gnostiscs claimed jesus sired children , good evidence against claim . gnostics , after all , made all kinds peculiar statements . but not this one . why ? why books like " holy blood , holy grail " " da vinci code " so popular ? perhaps they say what many people want hear . itself somewhat damning , i think . how many people want hear truth ?	-1

( 4 ) " color complex " -- various authors , very simple , straight forward analysis sociological point view . much research statistical facts used illustrate our communities infested these issues . ( 5 ) " darkest child " dolores philips great novel shows us poor blacks who live under poverty line ingesting these complex social hierarchies based color how they not only expose their children them , but force entire community live " color code " . everybody used it slavery system goes unchallenged . this book , tangy mae , darkest 10 children white-looking mother rozelle , struggles find her dignity confidence midst her evil light skinned mother inflicting one horrid abuse top other . one thing i say evil white-looking mother , rozelle , she treated all her children hiddeously contempt , whitest blackest . but she killed child who born looking like tangy mae spoke volumnes . this book very real metaphor what goes . very real .	1

i very disappointed this book . i very eager read this book learn wolfram thoughts new approach science , but there nothing this book justifies such lofty title . first six chapters book describe various types cellular automata , which computational models whose evolutionary behavior governed simple rules . wolfram devoted much his scientific career studying such systems . one particular system caught wolfram interest cellular automata model he calls " rule 30 " . what so remarkable " rule 30 " ? rule 30 starts off single element , through repeated application simple rule , rapidly evolves into system involving apparently complex behavior . there two big problems first six chapters this book . first , wolfram never bothers try explain what so special " rule 30 " . why doesn't rule 29 or rule 31 show complex behavior ? what essential elements rule 30 give complexity ? wolfram gives no information this . second big problem wolfram much too repetitive . point complexity generated simple rules hammered over over again . this book could clearly used lot editing . rest book describes ways which cellular automota applied various scientific problems , but no concrete , specific pathways given how tackle these various problems . rather , chapters consist various suggestions musings wolfram how cellular automata may relate wide range scientific problems . breadth his discussions more impressive than their depth , which often never gets much deeper than noting visual similarities some his diagrams physical appearances shells , tiger stripes , snowflakes , etc . key problem this book it never attempts analyze why some rules give " complex " behavior why others don't . i'm reminded story wolfram himself related time he showed richard feynman printout " rule 30 " : " well , we'd just crawling around floor -- help some other people -- trying use meter rules measure some feature giant printout it . feynman takes me aside , rather conspiratorially , says : " look , i just want ask you one thing : how you know rule 30 would all this crazy stuff ? " " you know me , " i said . " i didn't . i just computer try all possible rules . i found it . " " ah , " he said , " now i feel much better . i worried you some way figure it out . " " both wolfram feynman geniuses , but feynman something wolfram doesn't: gift seeing past unessentials getting gist problem . wolfram fills his books countless pages diagrams showing " complex " behavior , but never tries explain essential nature rule 30 . after reading this book , i'm also reminded statement freeman dyson , brilliant scientist , after he looked wolfram book : " there tradition scientists approaching senility tocome up grand , improbable theories . wolfram unusual he doing this his 40 "	-1

i must say this book stand it presents radically different view parenting than most books i've read . it holds most important thing kids very strong relationship their parents , almost all woes today kids caused them peer oriented instead parent oriented . authors make very strong case this so . i convinced time this part book over . however , many books this type , section where we told what this problem weaker . most ideas would work best very young child not yet become peer oriented . if you already child who rebellious addicted peers , i don't think speaking them kindly looking them eyes going much . author gave example his own children taking them away week vacation just child parent . sounds good , but i don't think his children severe problems other examples we given . book also perspective parents caring , kind , loving their childrens ' best interests heart . i know parents who read parenting books more likely fit this perspective , but i kept thinking not all parents completely wonderful . i think many child saved childhood would otherwise hellish their friends . author also feels children friendships not really true friendships , they not mature enough true friendships . i respect their courage say peer relationships not important we always led believe . but i think childhood friendships true ones . i know i still am very , very close least 3 my friends young childhood , i say looking back our friendship true start . i don't mean overly dispute message this book . i think it extremely well written brave book , i influenced ideas presented here very much . i just think it like most ideas taken extreme --- they fall apart bit when this case . but i want thank authors presenting this view parenting . it going play part my decision whether or not homeschool my oldest child . definately worth read	1

" yeah , right ! de botton doesn't really seem writing reader , more himself , very intellectual audience , who probably nod agree everything he says , because they too impressed they know so much too . it shame book turned out how it i think subject would made entertaining read if written different style . i going give it one star , but de botton clearly researched his subject well whic earns it extra star , but don't expect learn anything you don't know already	1

superstars children literature often contend continual cries their fans further adventures stories . how long you think j.k. rowling able keep her promise only seven harry potter tales before she breaks down consents one further story ? we should never forget when character ( or characters ) becomes famous beloved , he/she/they cannot rest peace . even sherlock holmes rose his grave star further adventures imaginings . it should come no surprise then lloyd alexander acquiesced , after fashion , his adoring public . after asked writer further tales land prydain , alexander chose give public what they wanted . sort . stories this book take place prydain they contain many beloved characters we've grown know . sly twist , however , alexander sets all these tales before any action we read prydain chronicles . this experiment prefacing stories we already know so well could ended up either derivative or depressing george lucas attempt create first three movies " star wars " series . instead , they end up tiny parables speak hope , light , beauty midst potential bloodshed terror . they're well worth reading . there eight stories this book total . first , " foundling " tale how sorcerer dallben raised three weird sisters midst swampy home gained more wisdom than he wanted . " stone " shows us dwarf doli his encounter man who wants live forever ( finds it unaccountably dull ) . " true enchanter " kind how-they-met tale explaining why princess eilonwy mother ( who , like all alexander heroines , exactly like eilonwy herself ) fell her very unmagical father . " rascal crow " just alexander excuse write his very own aesop tale too-clever crow his animal allies . " sword " explains why sword drynwyn met taran black blood . " smith , weaver , harper " parable , this time displaying continual greed man something little better . finally " truthful harp " shows how fflewddur fflam got his magic harp how coll dallben met " coll his white pig " . stories ( alexander himself points out author note ) read without picked up single prydain book before . i wouldn't necessarily recommend doing though . how significant average reader going find fact king rhitta died hand his own sword deep spiral castle if they haven't already picked up " book three " ? or dallben grew old before his time ? these stories aren't strictly need-to-know , but it certainly help . tales themselves , they're all right . nothing too spectacular , if you want my honest opinion . they take most basic elements all good folktales rework them over over . if there common theme any these stories , it all good tales work threes . alexander reworked them such way they appear somewhat original , but don't particularly surprised if you predict where each story going long before its close . end , this book really best those die-hard fans " prydain chronicles " who're clamoring further lloyd alexander facts fancies . anyone else probably find books little repetitive not particularly new . they're lovely little tales but there little recommend them but books they preface . nice but unnoticeable .	1

it insulting ( it must disheartening)for poet john ashbery stature told , again again , his poems don't make any sense . ashbery artificial superficially . it his critics who generally seem cold clever me . i laughed wept over his books ! i am hoping others my age ( i'm 30 ) not fall into same trap , which seems toplague older readers , smug vague their approval his work ( i.e. imitating what they think he like rather than what he poet . ) like allen ginsberg sylvia plath , different ways , i suppose , we need establish new critical basis discussing his work , which falls outside conventional opinions prejudices day . this may only say , ashbery become part canon american poetry ( this hardly denied) -- raises him higher plateau than those poets we see simply contemporaries ; it doesn't make him boring stiff . we enjoy unconventional ideas this most surprising poets ? example , much i admire self-portrait convex mirror book individual poem ; i acknowledge it masterpiece ... i nonetheless don't find it entertaining touching , ultimately , books included selected poems such some trees houseboat days wave . tennis court oath , which represented breakthrough both ashbery poetry , contains some his most beautiful , rapturous work , like quot ; how long i able inhabit divine sepulcher ... quot ; i don't think he wrote freely again , such musical emotional pull , until later flow chart , which sometimes similar even extact detail . bees , instance : quot ; probably always haunted beequot ; quot ; polluted any case bees . quot ; love main theme , after all , ashbery entire oeuvre . somebody once said me his poems like whiff perfume . it true , best sense . because they lovely contain sort romanticism eroticism one remembers them fondly . he may , i believe pauline kael wrote filmmaker max ophuls , quot ; nostalgia present . quot ; although he sometimes risks becoming objectionable purist himself -- he appear too fussy argumentative it own sake , or even rude , times -- he mostly kind , fair balanced , funny though he undeniably . who doesn't like poet like , or understand him ? even if one very different aesthetic , it intoxicating or even comforting voice listen . selected poems good place start , but then , if you chance , read whole volumes , what come after . you'll chance , because they ought around forever	1
like du maurier rebecca or tolkien sauron , julius caesar play which bears his name less focal presence than force largely off-stage which provokes choices actions more evident characters . caesar put several brief appearances during first three acts , but it marcus brutus whose nobility , naivete , seduction , treachery , rationalization , ultimate downfall make up overarching plot . shakespeare here avoids taking sides , however , so provides us shrewd study diverse motives attitudes always precede insurrection , chaos inevitably follows . most arden series , this critical edition represents superior scholarship valuable reader assistance . its extensive footnotes should illumine most instances unfamiliar language or allusion , appendix provides relevant excerpts plutarch lives , which shakespeare consulted many his details . those new julius caesar , however , best advised begin text play itself ( volume central section ) , saving so-called ' introduction ' until afterwards ; daniell excellent discussion relies heavily citations play content , his insights apt lost reader who , yet , little or no frame reference . it should noted , too , arden shakespeare editions best suited serious students amateurs already acquainted bard aspiring more advanced appreciation . come late field myself , i mean no condescension suggesting someone just setting out may find wealth material here bit overwhelming . potential rewards shakespearean discovery incalculable , it always tragic when worthy ambition burns itself out , want patience , attempting too much too soon . i began more modest editions , such signet classics or pelican , which i found very accessible sufficiently annotated provide help i then needed . arden , which issuing revising its series since 1899 , still around when one ready it .	1

( this , way , very interesting . many chinese looked upon their prisoner status way which escape newly formed communist government mainland china . ) , it turns out , it great conflict novel . both nationalist communist forces struggled mightily each other hearts minds those unallied prisoners , often most brutal fashion . one education one who spoke english , narrator himself considered prize , therefore received great deal attention both sides . indeed , after knocked unconscious one night , words , " *** communism , " tattooed bold fashion across his belly nationalists , who assumed he would no choice but side them . this , it turns out , rather common tactic . but narrator refused side them -- although occasionally pretending so out fear or self-preservation -- instead staying allied his communist protectors only so he could return his girlfriend mother . this plot . both his his fellow prisoner struggle survival prison , unwavering behind-the-barbed-wire war nationalists communists narrator fulcrum point , what comprise bulk novel . it should come no surprise anyone who any knowledge history all learn narrator ultimate repatriation mainland china bitterly disappointing . though not communist , he still traitor , you see , allowing himself captured . he found his mother died , his girlfriend could not afford associate him any more , he " disgraced captive . " narrator assigned middle-school hinterlands teacher remainder his career , sentence not nearly so dreary those given true communists he associated camps . no , this book not bestseller , but it nevertheless important book book needs read americans , many whom seem utterly unaware dangers posed unwavering , tyrannical political ideologies , horrors inflicted mankind because them .	1

there much like much useful bock commentary gospel luke . bock obviously his homework . one feature his commentary first rate when he approaches difficulties text or areas where scholars disagree , bock provides lists alternative explanations , who advocates them , his view their respective strengths weaknesses . if bock not see clear winner , he candid it . bock practice providing clear explanation different approaches text or problems history or sources extends excellent series " excursuses " end book . topics covered include census quirinius , sources synoptic relationships , genealogies matthew luke , discussions son man sayings . each section well written provides reader clear picture possible conclusions . bock more emphatic his own conclusions some sections than others . this section greatly enhances his commentary . feature distinguishes this book other commentaries luke its focus sources historicity . bock spends more time these issues , obviously linked his mind , than most other commentaries . he also highlights discussions their own sections . though they well written , degree satisfaction i felt after reading each one varied . some left me wanting much more discussion . i realize there space limitations gospel-specific commentaries , but sometimes felt bock bitten off more than he could chew . not he could not handle issues informed manner , but he simply insufficient space so . introduction well written , but not spend much time issues like authorship dating than i would liked . i am sure bock more offer those issues . instead , introduction spends more time dealing specific topics lucan text , such jerusalem : innocent one slain raised , faith dependence , prayer . most commentaries introduce reader some gospel authors theology focus , but i thought some these discussions would better served special notes within general discussion text , or more excursuses end . this simply organizational preference mine . sections well written . finally , i one other organizational criticism . he usually begins his discussion particular set passage overview his opinions passages . then he discusses " source history " , includes examination structure outline passage . only then he actually repeat text full section " exegesis exposition . " bock then includes summary additional notes . placing actual text middle discussion seemed odd me bugged me throughout . again , this just organizational , ergonomic , preference mine . actual discussions good . i simply believe they could enhanced different organization . overall , though i my organizational quibbles , valuable commentary exposes reader many different perspectives potential solutions problematic passages luke .	1

clearly , proust remarkable gift perception , if he able see human experience , circumstance , even plain objects , exploded detail , distill them reader . particularly first third parts book , he frequently drops gems absolute truth , much same way shakespearean couplets remarkably capture essence love or revenge . me , this reward reading book , what makes challenge worth undertaking . first , you may overwhelmed his very complex sentences , others noted . it important proust express entire thought one sentence ; lofty objective sometimes dire consequences , but proust adheres it admirably . you soon learn maintain subject sentence your head while proust explores two or three tangents original thought before he comes back it . what works reader favor proust very regular his sentence structure , so once you develop feel it , it ceases intimidate . book divided into three parts : first third parts recount experiences proust early childhood , while second part details love affair charles swann . me , first part most beautiful , followed third part . you able tell within first 50 or so pages whether or not proust suit you . second part book becomes plodding monotonous , proust narrates even simple set circumstances many layers redundancy , each recounted exhaustive detail , his complex style which begins feel formulaic , wordy , indulgent . here subject sentence , tangent number one , tangent tangent number one , tangent number two , then it ends yet metaphor invalids . regularity sentence structure much easier tolerate first third parts because proust flits several ideas or subjects , whereas second part , he drills very core earth one or two subjects few variations . i found myself feeling pretty burned out , counting down pages end part 2 . my advice pick up your reading speed if it starts become boring or if you lose your concentration . if proust not quite so overly thorough part 2 , or if he varied his cadence or sentence structure bit more , i could recommend this book without hesitation . it , it require unusual investment concentration patience , but i believe it worth it	1

shakespeare scholar , i read countless books my favorite writer . two books stand out best : john dover wilson quot ; what happens hamlet ? quot ; caroline spurgeon quot;shakespeare imagery . quot ; if i could only keep two shakespeare books my library , i would choose these . dr. spurgeon spent ten years sifting through entire shakespeare canon pulling out every metaphor simile she could find . then , she organized them into like groups . this offered her , us through her writing , insight into shakespeare creative genius . evidence hand , dr. spurgeon explored how shakepeare mind actually worked ; she uncovered his patterns creative thinking . his abundant use garden household images his relatively few uses classical or scholarly images show us writer more touch real everyday world . his childhood homelife , images one tends carry throughout one life , become crystal clear when set side side this fashion . spurgeon book , we clearly see works shakespeare written shakespeare , who born small town stratford , not works university trained dramatist or member queen elizabeth court . it fascinating see shakespeare images compared contrasted those marlowe , dekker , johnson . each writer thought created images unique manner . seeing understanding differences , expertly explained dr. spurgeon , gives one deeper insight into appreciation one greatest minds all time . if you love shakespeare then not miss reading this book	1
best military history i've ever read believe me i've read lot ' em .... explodes lots myths ( some intentional us navy ) much stuff wasn't declassified until late 80 . i think they ( us navy ) embarassed this book explains why . very little opinion it all thoroughly documented foot-noted . it reads like novel , mostly german british viewpoints . i couldn't put it down . there definitely severe criticism u.s. navy actions during 1942 before , but author gannon gives sound reasons coming his conclusions . one may argue details , but 3,997 ships sunk atlantic enough testimony something went haywire . gannon refuses gloss over mistakes made all sides conflict just lays out all facts . admiral king , gannon references excerpt general eisenhower 1942 wartime journal said quickest way end war atlantic " shoot admiral king . " even gannon acknowledges us navy finally catch tactical strategic lessons anti-submarine warfare ( after much goading british canadians ) , but i believe even seasoned students military history absolutely shocked timidity incompetence naval high command outbreak war germany . this book well foot-noted indexed so if one so inclined primary source material readily examined .	1

twisted selection short stories thriller writer jeffrey deaver . deaver points out intro one advantage short stories you alter ending or characters make story little darker or depressing than novel . since reader only invests few minutes into short story , they don't expect happy or tidy ending . all stories this collection suspensful involve twist some sort . services rendered triangle probably two best . they stand out because twist . all stories similar they only involve few characters . so when story goes one direction , you correct assuming twist involve story going other direction end . this book easy read may perhaps persuade me pick up jeffrey deaver novel . i'm all twists turns , but some reason not enjoy empty chair . i haven't read any more deaver since . i don't know if its worth paying money short story collection . but if you deaver fan , or suspense fan , i'm sure you'll enjoy this collection stories .	1

one might not expect naturalist explorer capable weaving dynamic , emotional , gripping narrative par some best fiction writers last century , but that exactly what peter matthiessen accomplished play fields lord . his writing strongly influenced his extensive travels , this , his fourth novel , imbued particular verve . set amazon , tale weaves out untamed jungle , featuring some most compelling conflicted characters i've encountered . martin quarrier , his wife hazel , their son billy left their comfortable midwestern life join protestant missionary leslie huben his wife their ongoing struggle convert elusive local tribe , niaruna . martin respect interest tribal cultures encourages different approach conversion than evangelical leslie , matters quickly become complicated when local authorities ( leslie implicit approval ) enlist aid two american ex-patriot mercenaries bomb tribes into submission . one these lewis moon , half chayenne indian dark past who , under influences powerful psychotrope ayahuasca , eventually decides join niaruna reclaim something his lost dignity sense identity . ultimately , niaruna caught amongst protestant missionaries , catholic " opposition , " local authorities , partial-converts other tribes ; it essentially conflict no one win . narrative weaves martin moon perspectives , each comes grips their own inner conflicts faith identity . matthiessen breathes further life into this story colorful , very real cast supporting characters . ex-patriot mercenary wolf , self-described " anti-se-mite jew " former compatriot disappeared moon provides occasional black humor . matthiessen portrays hazel gradual disintegration frightening realism , building books cumulative tension effectively . leslie huben , his evangelical fervor golden boy demeanor , becomes unexpected antagonist martin struggles his own faith . matthiessen treatment niaruna other brazilian cultures realistic sympathetic without pandering or idealistic , where aboriginals portrayed niether heathens or noble savages . he approaches questions faith , culture , morality , family , spirituality understated ability without becoming mired existentialism . his narrative simultaneously raw elegantly constructed , both exotic intimate read . play fields lord isn't mere travel fiction ; it complex character study suspenseful , driven plot , thought-provoking examination mission work . matthiessen scrutinizes evangelical christianity through very sharp lens , faith individual missionaries remains complex fascinating even non-believer . novel perspective christianity critical one , but personalized through actions individuals without universally condemning . writing comfortable easily digested , while still evoking complex themes moods make this novel so successful . oppresive atmosphere , sense fear uncertainty , primeval jungle ; all richly evoked these pages . it heartbreaking , rewarding , thought-provoking , ultimately haunting read . ~ jacquelyn gil	1

i listen dr. dean time time i really enjoy listening him . i thoroughly enjoyed reading his book well . first all , you need realize dr. dean not practicing physician . ( he doesn't see patients or perform procedures diagnoses ) however , he claims spend lot time reading research studies , something many busy physicians may not time . so , sense he different kind experience - knowledge gained study , not first-hand experience . this good because it different view what your doctor may . this book , dr dean challenges many myths we what it means " healthy " . one opinion he shares his readers little overweight may not such bad thing . fact , it gives body some reserves case illness . this goes so contrary what we usually hear , but it really makes you think . he also challenges number myths we hear such " exercise increases your appetite actually makes you gain weight " . he explains why these aren't true . dr. dean also touches one my personal favorite myths - germophobia . some our ideas where germs hide how prevent getting sick aren't always correct . example , place your home most germs not your bathroom - it your kitchen . if you read this book , you may not so excited get hotel room jetted tub next time . most valuable thing this book it makes you think . media loves hype up health concerns - " ebola virus spread kill us all ?

i heard amusing stories how messed up brian wilson one point , but until reading this i never realized how not funny his condition ! it must painful writing it it living it . i dont think i've ever heard such brutally honest confessions stories such important icon wilson . additionally , this probably one best source inside info beach boys , since brian practically beach boys . i am aware some other books written , but who could tell better story than person who lived it ? this case this story cant effectively told anyone but brian ( ... who else would know what voices his head said , etc . ) while reading , you get imoression ( actually its quite obvious ) this book written during time when relationships other bandmates obviously strained , it particularly evident latter part book . much bitterness directed mike love , perhaps justifiably so based other accounts i've read him . after reading , i'm not sure i agree totally dr. landy methods , but i believe brian wouldnt around write this book it not landy . this book could ended brian quot ; resurrectionquot ; 1983 , all events descrbed after really alot bitterness downright nastiness directed other beach boys . i'm not faulting brian this , it seemed me most it landy influence . it seemed like landy way getting back other beach boys exposing him fraud he really turned out brian expense , brian ended up sued over this book what i understand . still though , this book offers first hand accounts some events inspired ( or case smile , destroyed ) most beach boys material . i hope someday this book de-landyized re-written brian . this fascinating important insight into pop music should not out print . how important ? name least one other major icon sixties ever published auto-biography . stones ? dylan ? beatles ? none , all 3rd party observation speculative accounts . besides , much i love these other bands , they cant hold candle musically brian wilson . read this book , but stop after you get 1983	1

books leadership dime dozen these days , often they start blending together . however , john maxwell put together some great insights into leadership often taken granted or not well described . book starts solid question any leader ; " am i raising up potential leaders ? " . what makes this focus important fact too often leaders focus leading results , not future leadership . important distinction . aspect book looks ripple effects leaders . true leaders able attract potential leaders because ; leaders think like them ; leaders express feelings other leader sense ; leaders create environment attracts potential leaders ; leaders not threatened people great potential . author lays out what happens when strong leaders not selected . they turn hire people less leadership skills than they , so . organization whole suffers result this domino effect . leaders who mentor potential leaders multiply their effectiveness . while this sounds simple , it rare . " there no success without successor " ( page 11 ) . leaders take others them , or they not true leaders but mere managers . delegation most powerful tool leader . ( page 159 ) however , if delegation so important then why some leaders fail delegate effectively ? some ideas postulated here ; insecurity ; lack confidence others ; lack ability train others ; lack time ; etc . my experience most common these aspects lack confidence , many so called leaders never take final step " giving complete authority " others . this derails success future potential . i find this most common weakness leaders corporate america , who turn should not considered leaders , but rather just people higher titles . overall , this very good book . author asserts leadership both combination tactical choices personal character , latter more important . great book , easy read , some assessments other tools included . this book benefit anyone who wants enable success their organization through leadership .	1

like alison lurie first novel , " love friendship " , her second deals marital disharmony among members america academic community . whereas earlier book , however , set wintry new england , " nowhere city " takes place sunny california . paul cattleman , young university historian , accepts job big corporation based los angeles write company history . one major themes book cultural differences america east west coasts . paul his wife katherine both easterners , she upper-class new england family . first they react their change scene very different ways . paul loves los angeles its sunny climate its relaxed lifestyle . katherine , other hand , hates city . this partly because atmospheric pollution aggravates her allergies , but mostly because she regards it cultural wasteland , " nowhere city " book title . los angeles , her , appears no sense history , place living " eternal dizzying present " , where differences seasons , even day night , less distinct than they north-east . differences couple create tensions within their marriage . paul begins affair young waitress named ceci gets drawn into her circle unconventional friends living venice beach , time centre beatnik community . ( book set early sixties ) . this leads into theme book , way which california became americans second half twentieth century what america general europeans earlier generations- frontier , place refuge those dissatisfied one reason or life home seeking better life elsewhere . los angeles area therefore natural magnet beatnik hippie movements . ( this idea california " last resort " also theme eagles ' song name ; it interesting lurie later borrowed title one her own novels , although book set florida rather than california ) . katherine , seeking something which occupy herself , finds work secretary university california , where she too begins affair her boss , academic psychiatrist who estranged husband glamorous hollywood starlet named glory green . this leads complex emotional entanglement . paul affair ceci comes end ; she knows full well he married , but cannot accept idea he still sexual relations his wife . paul then seduced glory , who seeking revenge against her husband . eventually , paul finds himself falling out love california lifestyle , especially after company refuse publish his history which shows them too harsh light , decides move back east take up teaching job prestigious new england college , decision which provokes ironic role-reversal book ending . i can't agree earlier reviewer who said you begin book hating katherine sympathizing paul . my sympathies katherine throughout . paul selfish character who always put his own needs before those his wife ; he bullies her into moving california , ceci no means his first extra-marital affair . it seemed me book written subtly feminist viewpoint interpreted story how katherine learns stand up , say no , her self-centred husband . normal lurie work , tone book , despite some serious themes , relatively light , plenty satirical humour aimed characters ' pretensions . big nutting corporation like social kudos harvard-educated historian their payroll , but not like it when he tells them some truths they not want hear . dr einsam psychiatrist so busy analysing life he unable experience it . glory film industry types who surround her shown up shallow , vain insincere . ( satire hollywood sixties reminded me joan didion " play it it lays " , although book darker more serious tone ) . beatniks childish , more economically dependent than they like think " square " society they despise . although they see society intolerant narrow-minded , same could said their own system values its " them us " mentality . times i found some this satire somewhat unfair . beatnik hippie movements may their hypocritical side , but least their unconventionality idealism force middle america ask itself some difficult questions it might preferred avoid . there really no unpretentious or sincere people working entertainment industry ? nevertheless , satirist role not fair-minded ; satire strains see both sides every question nails its colours firmly fence hardly worthy name . theme cultural differences east coast west coast america perhaps less interesting me , englishman , than it would american readership . ( it always struck me , anyway , two coasts more common each other than either america interior heartland ) . although this not my favourite alison lurie book ( i prefer some her later books such " real people " " truth lorin jones " which greater depth insight ) , " nowhere city " certainly enjoyable read	1

this book describes few simple techniques dealing difficult questions audience after formal business presentation , or journalists after press conference . particular , author explains how control interaction questioners , formulate answers less likely perceived audience contentious or evasive , how forcefully get one message across part answer . techniques themselves could described 4 or 5 pages . nevertheless author manages put together whole book - firstly analogizing them martial arts , then providing detailed examples last 40 years presidential debates . this works out very well indeed , reader left thorough understanding mechanics involved handling these situations - based both concepts debate examples described . after finishing book i really felt i coming away something tangible could utilized my advantage variety situations - both professional personal .	1

prose author delightful : it originally published 1930 when better authors genteel but sophisticated style . author original intention set forth theory metaphor distinguishing analyzing , title says , seven forms ( linguistic ) ambiguity . he draws examples which he exercizes his probative skill mostly great writers english language . but those schooled after , say , 1950s it wonderful exhortation read , speak write more subtelty than usually encountered . corollary case he makes ambiguity -- carefully crafted ambiguity , not ambiguity slothful kind -- very powerful , but it presupposes precision reading writing which precondition well-crafted metaphor . such it stands our generations exhortation lingusitic sophistication implicit disproof quot ; libertyquot ; goes hand hand slovenliness . it certainly make better readers out those who go through his book	1

i read whole ender series , but strange sequence which may affected way i view different books series . first book i read shadow hegemon , thanks tourist left it library hotel skiathos island . this book got me hooked , but it confused me also i didn't know if i should start reading next books or previous ones . general pattern whole series : beginning book ender game . then we two subcategories , one shadow series ( which , exception first book , take place earth more within military strategy ) one ender series ( which take place space more into new sci-fi ideas ) . shadow series probably read everyone , while i guess ender series ( especially speaker dead onwards ) would read mainly sci-fi fans . below my comments books series , order i read them marking ( 10 highest mark ): shadow hegemon : first book i read , which i could not leave my hands . i finished it 2 days . it fast paced action , very smart plot after reading it i believed orson scot card ( osc ) invented/re-invented new genre literature . military strategy adventure combined brilliance/mind games hidden portions romance . such books always existed but this seemed book . it like way dan brown re-invented books trivials puzzles , together fast paced adventure . i strongly recommend it everybody likes such type books . ( mark : 10)shadow puppets : sequel above . i found it interesting but somehow boring above story developed little focus characters ( maybe too much focus so it seemed me it slightly mumbling jumbling . strategy , brilliance adventure seemed very low here . i would not recommend it anybody read it isolate , unfortunately you read it if you want go next book . i really believe osc made mistake here ( deliberately or not ) this book should told 50-60 pages included previous or next book . ( mark : 6 but you read it because you want read shadow giant)shadow giant : ( see below)ender game : really great book read , probably best series , however , i read its sequels first , when i reached 80% this book , i predicted end . however , it highest standards sci-fi , military strategy , adventure , brilliant mind games very good depth human aspect characters . comparison shadow series , it more " space " sci-fi , while shadow series much lesser sci-fi elements more down earth . ( mark : 10)speaker dead : great book , but different style . less adventure , more human aspect , more maturity . brilliance yes , but not military , sci-fi yes ( some great ideas ) but not spaceship style . ( mark : 9)xenocide : good sequel previous novel . certain points more brilliant , other sections more boring , however again very good sci-fi book . only flaw these series ( speker dead , xenocide , children mind ) idea behind one alien species described which i found outrageously extreme , however if you ignore it becomes first class reading . ( mark : 9)children mind : i think osc wrapped up his case pretty badly one . it fair book except fact i felt osc mumbles jumbles one third novel not decided how end it . other critiques i found it described nice approach moral dilemmas , however , moral dilemma when you describe it once make your choice , while here dilemma repeated repeated ... i felt like i watching movie worth 10 oscars end not worth included even cheap video movie . again , many open ends end ( possible sequels ) . ( mark : 7 but you read it you hooked previous ones ) . ender shadow : read enders game shadow hegemon , i found this book probably best series , which course my subjective preference . i could characterize it probably best book i read ever ! not repeat myself , it all shadow hegemon ender game , even more ... ( mark : absolute 10 ) . shadow giant : when i read shadow puppets , i said , " that it , osc lost either his talent or his appetite good writing ... " , so i pretty unwilling read it . fortunately i decided , it proved good one , i believe osc nicely wrapped up his story , two small flaws . * one described below ( its end needed slightly more complete ) , * other fact although he describes certain smart battles , he not focus enough them it seems he hurry wrap all things up . it all elements become masterpiece but it ended up good read book ( mark : 9)in general , both series three categories good stuff : 1 ) some great sci-fi ideas ( battle room , battle games , fantasy game , ansible , aia , jane , in/out travel , raman varelse etc)2 ) great military strategy , mind games etc combined adventure3 ) certain books , depth characters , moral dilemmas etcand two main bad stuff : 1 ) mumbling jumbling certain books which completely unnecessary ( either osc wanted just produce sell title - see shadow puppets- or he could not decide how story continue-see last book ender series ) . 2 ) one alien species described ender series so too outrageous even sci-fi made it look ridiculous . idea behind it brilliant sci-fi terms , but he could try different living organism ... finally , osc left open ends both series ( probably next sequels ) , however i believe there two things missing . ) story hive queen hegemon , told metaphorical manner so it means much humanity . ) ancient theatre , story should end way brings " katharsis " story , souls readers . i believe end shadow giant may smart commercial purposes but it very unfair reader it not bring full " katharsis " .	1

epic tale combining mystery fantasy , treason more than meets expectations--i'd even go so far say it one card best . although storylines completely different , card visits moral dilemmas familiar readers ender series : genocide acceptable tradeoff salvation entire planet ? sacrifice one individual justifiable greater good entire race ? ender game , card creates cold oppressive cage known battle school confine young ender . treason , card creates lush diverse world his protagonist lanik mueller explore his exile . whereas ender growth largely internal self-driven , mueller picks up extraordinary powers while walking earth , meeting new people learning new skills . lanik frequently forced ask himself deeper questions life , sacrifice , identity , all while understanding more he learns , more complex difficult his choices become . he starts novel alone freak ; saving his own skin almost more than he manage . he ends novel terrible powers responsibility comes them , forced choose best way save planet hurtling towards destruction death . unlike ender , he fully aware choice he must make , making his decision all more anguishing tragic . card takes many risks creating fantastic world reader must simply accept -- this tale belongs more realm fantasy than pure " science " fiction . yet risk pays off , making reading experience all more memorable . reader drawn nature protagonist grotesque transformation beauty world stretches imagination . mystery intrigue surrounding planet sudden power shifts keeps plot moving nicely , card creates strong believable cast characters breathe life into story , giving it center soul . finally , card leaves reader ponder lanik decision face nearly impossible choice , world characterized not black white but subtle shades grey . treason probably never garner attention ender game , but nevertheless it excellent thought-provoking story . this book hidden gem canon modern sf fantasy literature reward reader who takes time unearth it	1

since i took graduate seminar course women memoirs american literature , i read several books heilbrun . i not going specialize autobiography/memoirs or feminist theory , i read her more writer than scholar or theorist , focusing more how she says things than what . this regard , i enjoyed every book i read because her language something unique . it clear concise , without simple , authoratitive without pedantic , seemingly aloof yet strangely persuasive . if passion name talent , she very , very passionate , but passion moderated unique kind resignation ( or perhaps , wisdom ) . this book not my favorite , compared other titles such writing women lives , it indeed gets slow heavy here there . there parts where even those same line work heilbrun would go , " who cares ? " or " why bother ? " yet , largely , it accessible * fun * . read intellectual memoir , it story how heilbrun gratefully influenced three men , how she resisted embraced their influence , how she finally grew out it . there many interesting anecdotes coming her encounters these men ( barzun , fadiman , trilling ) her life graduate student 50s one most highly regarded universities us . students today would gasp nightmarish inconvinience only two copies their papers , painfully taking turns reading other student papers due lack copies . heilbrun devoted chapter diana trilling , which wasn't her plan when he planned book . she fascinated gained admiration her process research book , readers would clearly see why chapter her . sum , according heilbrun , diana trilling woman whose insights her life come largely feminism ( " most successful revolution our century , " trilling herself called it ) , yet who not herself feminist . she accepted life belittlements others , while penetrating understanding those belittlements . early book , heilbrun notes perhaps one most palpable influences she got lionel trilling would notion " tragedy what most marks us if we thinkers .

just finished reading tragedy triumph where dr. loovas persuaded author tell her story , i find similarities sound miracle dr. bernard rimland coaxing this author , annabel stehli share her story . while reading these two books any parent child autism spectrum shocked learn what parents ahead us endured via professionals media based their incorrect perception autism . what i not agree promotional aspect these books , suggesting autism cured these kids overcome disability . sound miracle touted tribute mother courage , yet after reading same book , i feel mother failed daughter not gain proper insight into her autistic daughter georgie . there two parts sound miracle , auditory training not discussed first half book . not wanting criticize author too harshly i feel book delved more into her older daughter dotsie , who passed away leukemia , mother two marriages her own addictions religious beliefs . this could easily written into two or three books covering each topic depth . there gap many years when georgie graduated college author wrote book . maybe time she could see more clearly how georgie needed help right beginning . it obvious author not confident her parenting skills questioned herself throughout process raising children . author hard time cuddling receiving eye contact time georgie born 1965 , plus she knew there something odd her eyes , she low apgar score . there always seemed turmoil their apartment new york . her husband bill not very involved parenting aspects girls . early story annabel took girls away few weeks one summer vacation . during this time bill affair her best friend things went downhill drastically . bill not mentioned too often after , only briefly when dotsie died then when annabel wanted take georgie france . sound miracle upsetting me because after dotsie passed away georgie institutionalized many years . this started trial since there no alternative georgie . annabel intimidated staff institution believed them when they stated her lack parenting blame . one point she drinking taking many prescriptions , ended up committed herself . i found period time confusing because her mother siblings only involved intermittently . moment there i not want finish perusing this because i not sure which direction sound miracle headed found passing dotsie very sad . how parent time never heard dr. bernard rimland beyond me . it certainly seemed me author would not act her own parental instincts needed reassurance every move then it even took others persuade her remove georgie institution try auditory training dr. berard . while georgie institution her mother met married peter two more children . author actually pondered several times leaving georgie institution starting her own life her new husband children . she not devoted her daughter she wanted normal child her new son not risk her daughter coming home possibly hurting her baby . parent two children autism i learn great deal auditory aspects , but this due georgie sharing her personal experience not anything author shared parent . all those years georgie just assumed everyone saw heard things way she , but she crazy not able handle these issues same manner . one hand i truly disappointed first section book after reading suffering georgie endure due no one researching further her issues . i questioning author remarrying starting family when i felt she abandoned failed her daughter . most shocking part within book when institution contacted her ex husband , bill try persuade him keep her taking georgie out country . bill some relative look into dr switzerland agreed annabel this worth trying . it turned out otherwise i would very upset feel professionals should punished their wrong doing interference her life . i prefer books positive outlook autism not those base outcome miracle . although this one those some aspect , it still worthwhile read know firsthand what journey like others . but my children autistic what i gather always since i am not looking cure , but hope actually hear sound my child voice one these days . reader i cared dotsie georgie heartbroken over death one lost childhood other . i came away learning more trials tribulations this family know what avoid when pursuing therapies searching schools my children future reference	1

this book basically well-organized laundry list hoaxes . author arranges hoaxes logical categories based type deception involved . some , especially those further past , sound preposterous , but one must always account differences knowledge thought processes times past now . what most disturbing me fact some hoaxes sounded plausible ; it makes you wonder how many pieces knowledge we take granted might well-contrived hoaxes . conspiracy theorists take attitude extreme , seeing hoaxes everywhere . but hoaxes most prevalent when it hard get independent supporting data topic , which this book points out . instance , if white fellow turned up europe claimed taiwanese native , we would laugh him . but white fellow turn up europe several centuries ago , claiming native formosa ( taiwan former name ) . without additional information ( taiwanese asians ) , people europe unable quickly discount story	1

i've always looked upon " christian " fiction rather wary eye . it less subject matter than lesser quality these works ; it if publishers cynically assumed merely presenting something " christian " would enough guarantee certain level readership , no matter how poorly written book ( this often science fiction fantasy well ) . three ( or more properly , thr3e ) ted dekker little alter my view . ( why i read book ? because when i bought it ( dekker book ) , i didn't realize fully what i buying . ) three tells story kevin parson , seminary student who suffered strange , semi-abusive childhood . he gets phone call one day warning him unless he solves riddle within three minutes , his car explode . kevin doesn't solve riddle car blow up , but he escapes intac t.t hus begins cat-and-mouse game slater , who may or may not serial killer named riddle killer . slater believes kevin committed grave sin requires confession or death . kevin , his childhood friend samantha ( now state cop ) jennifer peters ( fbi agent ) try hunt down slater , but slater apparently too clever caught easily . there not much truly christian this book other than few religious lines ( never getting very preachy ) definitely pg-rated material : language gentle enough , romance chaste violence relatively bloodless . i'm fine all long story good , that not case here . it actually too bad , because dekker seems like decent enough plotter , but story relies plot twist one most annoying suspense fiction ; i won't say what it , but even dekker seems bit uncomfortable it , he spends lot time rationalizing it . addition , perpetrate this twist , he actively deceive ( not merely mislead ) reader , which cheat . addition , even though dekker good sense plot ( till end ) he able maintain fast , tense pace , he overall , just passable writer . i suppose technically his work proficient , but compared great names crime stories ( elmore leonard , michael connelly , lee child , etc . ) , dekker prose just flat . two-star rating , it not worst book out there , but it one avoid .	1

bloody bones continues anita blake series exploring anita " gifts " developing characters very well utilized later novels . while i give this novel four stars , i consider series total five star quality they get much better storylines become more complex . this novel emphasises her skills necromancer , ton vampire action ( introduces few new types supernatural creatures ) . also , it worthwhile note cover art , one may assume this novel would fall paranormal romance genre , but i not believe case ; instead i would more inclined classify this book action adventure touch noir . later books series however , shift bit include elements romance genre ( my mind , book six " killing dance " marks change tone series ) . even after genre shift however , books retain strong emphasis action macabre . bloody bones , it light , fast-paced all-in-all fun read	1

this book annoyed me . start my diatribe , there too many characters , each every one one whom seemed illogical , stupid , not all endearing . " paranormal " branch mounties ? i thought it supposed fantasy affecting real people this world , not fantasy affecting fantasy . one gets idea author tried explain what happening readers , but ended up explaining things characters instead which why one never believe it when characters disbelieving . i never believe it when characters anything , actually . i don't understand how anybody brains could function like . their thought processes just absurd . protaginist needs stop smoking , because she seems roll new cigarette every sentance she inhabits . hard-boiled investigator should take look what his girlfriend puts his dinner because he accepts unacceptable ( least hard-boiled investigator ) unblinking reserve . male lead needs stop speaking thinking (!) french because he not , eccentric millionaire uncle needs borrow some protaginist ciggarettes calm down . only character i liked even remotely biker art critic , but i think author trying little too hard clever when blue born . it also very confusing way plot jumps around goes backwards forwards thirty some characters ( all whom , i must mention again , really annoying ) . it makes it hard one keep one attention book , instead just going over one grocery list whilst staring page . looks like delint some time travelling too . you excuse him , he gets mixed up . all those quantum leaps . what all outdated profanity ? i mean , who says " lord lifting jesus !

inner temple first book series penczak writing beginners . they based classes he teaches live , take much different approach than standard 101 guides . first , there well-laid out structure these books i find extremely helpful . each book designed year-and-a-day study course . there few introductory chapters followed 12 lesson chapters . you spend roughly month each lesson ( some more complex take more time , but they balanced simpler lessons ) . this gives you time absorb material , complete exercises , some additional reading . second , penczak emphasizes importance strong foundation meditation , visualization , psychic development dedicating entire inner temple these practices . more complex lessons circle casting , ritual design , spells saved outer temple . i found this major improvement over standard 101 book includes both same book no clear indication how much time you should spend foundation exercises before trying ritual , or worse , skip foundation exercises entirely . i honestly wished i picked up this book first when i started my journey . penczak approach witchcraft emphatically eclectic . you see concepts practices many occult traditions here . there obvious new age influence his work come across " fluffy , " but i don't think it bad some reviewers thought . he emphasizes love his practice , i not see anything wrong . should he emphasized potential dangers some practices more ? perhaps . he includes cautions , but tries put them perspective peel away intimidating veneer created horror movies like . course takes you varied tour starting simple skills like basic meditation , affirmations , very simple magic , more complex practices like astral travel , working spirit guides , healing , past-life regression . style also very open non-dogmatic . penczak presents lots personal opinions theories , but they presented opinions theories , not holy writ . because this eclecticism , this book could used selectively course psychic development anyone open mind , not just people interested wicca or paganism . all all , while i could find quite bit this book argue , i think it deserves five star rating its usefulness presentation . i thank mr. penczak making his teaching available wider audience this way	1

i enjoyed first two books this trilogy . however , this third book needs some serious time intensive book surgery unit before it should even published . frankly , this manuscript should kicked back editor author refused . i realize that pretty heavy thing say , but it true . something went badly wrong here . author not his job bringing his protagonists closure ; two kids fall love , then decide live apart rest their lives complete crock . puhleaze . i grew rather like aeronaut texan explorer , they're killed little point . puhleaze . iorek bear darn cool , he barely ( sorry ) makes appearance book 3 . puhleaze . , way , who mary , introduced so late trilogy , underfunded dark matter physicist ( who just happens ... ex-nun ... now , just wait minute here , heavy handed or what ? ) ... dark matter would * under * funded ? puhleaze .

" never give reader chance put down one your books , because if you , they , they'll never pick it up again .

this author unfortunatly gives christians bad name . not only he profess kjv bible only viable translation ( just read introduction ) but he also believes , " satan despised america her unique relationship king james bible ... " ( . 329 ) . i guess he doesn't understand preservation god word or understand greek , but i could wrong . basically my title states it best : stupid people believe anything , anyone who buys this book believes dr. grady truly winner . now i state there few truths dr. grady claims ( probably more than i am even willing admit ) , however structure his book very laughable his broad claims concerning kjv numerous scriputure verses taken out context ruin any chance believability . this book clearly falls under category christian conspiracy theory . i'll leave you one last quote this book summs up my feelings , " exaggerated masonic connection birth our republic led many well-intended conspiracy writers overreact , sometimes brink lunacy " ( . 330 ) . well least he knows how describe himself	-1
i think alot reviewers both sides here no business reviewing this book first place . let me explain this example : if you don't speak french you pick up book written french you probably recognize some words even understand few sentences based knowledge you might basic french because similarity many french words english words ( or whatever language(s ) you know ) . but you won't able completely understand book unless you sit down translate it . it would stupid proclaim book failure just because you don't understand language . same way , you might appreciate beauty french language think book sounds pretty even if you can't understand it , but this no reason claim book masterpiece . we might well consider finnegan wake book written different language we aren't fluent . book ( or any work art , matter ) isn't bad just because you work understand it . may make it frustrating but it doesn't make it bad . so , if you don't think it worth time effort use reading guides or whatever make sense this book , then you should just leave it alone instead going around acting like anything you say book any merit whatsoever . note , it completely absurd review this book just you would book stephen king - based how entertaining storyline or how realistic certain characters - simply because this not what book aiming first place . this would like judging mona lisa piece crap because you're big fan cave drawings showing chain events you didn't see what chain events mona lisa . you judge work based how well it succeeds what it trying , not how well it succeeds what everyone else it trying	1

love him or hate him , dfw prodigious talent . except disturbing " conversations hideous men " i found his previous material so hilariously , intelligently , on-target i willing overlook multitude stylistic transgressions ( chiefly , overly cutesy tone , gratuitous flaunting author erudition , footnote fetish ) . so i reasonably disposed like this book looking forward reading it . sadly , it turns out this case where dfw various idiosyncrasies combine produce book which fundamentally unreadable . normally , once i start book , i feel enormous guilt if i don't finish . no guilt here - just exasperation . one reasonably argue dfw enormous talent might justify certain peculiarities style , but every author needs discipline good editor . w.w. norton seems dispensed editors altogether , certainly sentient kind . pity , because somebody should explained dfw prefacing any section text title " soft-news interpolation , placed here ante rem because this last place it without disrupting juggernaut-like momentum pre-cantor mathematical context " not just completely unhelpful . it irritating distraction , sorry result inability this talented writer vanquish demons which continue plague his undisciplined style . unfortunately , this kind self-indulgent stylistic mannerism recurs infuriating frequncy . result , this book complete train wreck	-1

angela davis talks many different points her book prisons obsolete ? she tries convince audience current u.s. prison system not run adequately . davis questions united states system justice prison system currently houses over two million people throughout nation . her book , she argues prisons not solve crime over past twenty years prison boom not lowered crime rates across country , but intensified criminal behavior . injustices within current prison system , including institutionalized racism , gender inequalities , class segregation thoroughly explored this book . she also debates whether prison reform would enough or prison abolition necessary . this book great piece literature exposes readers little no knowledge prisons some cruel realities . book offers overview history prisons . davis takes example california , state which " landscape thoroughly prisonized over last twenty years " ( davis , 12 ) . this overview extremely important underline davis ' point prisons become ineffective rehabilitatory institutions . although , theoretically , main purpose prison rehabilitate criminals , economic factors well racist motives , quickly drove prison system emulate new way slavery . davis says : " segregation ruled south until it outlawed century after abolition slavery . many people who lived under jim crow could not envision legal system defined racial equality " ( davis , 23 ) . need cheap labor south incited spur legislations promoted incarceration many african americans possible after civil war . these prisoners , then , leased out resulting productive yet cheap laborers . davis touches base racism economic oppression issues chapter two her book . evidence help us understand causes which prisons started proliferate when official studies showed crime rate going down ( davis , 85 ) , professor davis uses fact " many corporations global markets , now rely prisons important source profit " ( davis , 85 ) . all data compiled chapter five davis ' book important explain how prison system embodied prison industrial complex manipulates inmates ' labor exchange economic gain . she attributes so-called " tough crime " legislation private prisons other corporations ' interests . although chapter five bombards reader communist idealism , communist mentality not necessary understand davis ' conclusions . even though not enough facts statistics given book regards problem system , book offers two chapters full first hand information gathered davis . nevertheless , book emphasis proposing prison abolition program should go hand hand prison reform movement ( davis , 9-10 ) . she voice many prison reformers who trying end violence sexual abuse prisons , provide prisoners education so their civil rights not stripped away , most importantly , work prisons part solution not cause problem . her last chapter , professor davis proposes , not so concrete ideas adopt completely different system or correction . this book weakest chapter since it too rhetorical lacks solid proposals . she implies amount knowledge work necessary make solid change fact not very achievable saying : " abolitionist approach seeks answer questions such these would require us imagine constellation alternative strategies institutions " ( davis107 ) , referring questions such " how we imagine society which punishment not based race class ? " (davis107 ) . nonetheless her ideology optimism opens many possibilities could fact effective substitutes incarceration . it all these reasons i recommend this book everyone who interested knowing hidden problems within current u.s. prison system ongoing racial segregation issues . this book makes us think whether or not prisons obsolete . davis thinks they .	1

microsoft company whose origins leader , bill gates , well documented . brand one most recognized world , countless millions use their products . what less known though how organization transform itself recently while never letting their collective foot off gas . first hundred pages or so start history how gates founded company . i felt author didn't go into too much detail or attempt write autobiography , just provide enough background set stage changes come . catalyst according author doj lawsuit filed against microsoft . impact gates described profound , helped bill steve ballmer initiate some changes few company philosophies . there few themes emerged me when reading . among them facts company ( rare ) focus never standing still . always concerned out innovated , or beat marketplace , company created culture where employees leadership relentless improving . ( rare ) organizational trait focus hiring talented people . only ge my personal experience understood hiring smartest , best , all levels critical success . microsoft leaders legendary their unusual interviewing techniques , all designed hire brightest thinkers . while these traits made company successful , according author they alone not enough take microsoft forward after recent events . one biggest changes bill gates stepping out top role into technology role , steve ballmer taking ceo role . this move may surprising outside , but it seems it allows both what they best . further changes focus developed two broad areas , values customer focus . steve ballmer sought influence talent inside microsoft better work together , more respectful self critical , so . book outlines short list these values . second area even stronger focus customer orientation . these concepts outlined some detail . overall , book easy read , not any way dry my opinion . author credible job portraying events outside influences led " reboot " or transition companies must go through they grow . anyone interested microsoft , book provides interesting overview life cycle organization profound impact world .	1

wilken treats us number pagan apologists including galen , porphyry celsus . these bright , inquisitive men , carefully examining christians roman eyes . romans likewise sensed entity above all other gods , celsus shocked find christians paradoxically " invented " satan power constrain almighty god - act celsus considered blasphemy . ( development this political tool see pagels . ) wilken opens roman world turned our own preferences almost entirely forgotten compiling these authors their own words . striking notion roman religion didn't need replacing when christianity ( hundreds mystery cults same time ) came . but something missing , else why success ? this very opposite brooks adams ' " law civilization decay " . whatever reason , once again we find " they " not so different " us " . one value wilken book read how strongly romans viewed tradition . completely alien modern america , tradition rome everything . what gods your ancestors worshiped one hundred years ago - associated your town or region - precisely same gods worshiped today . add this flood ideas around empire protection what native strong enough kill . then came christians , who like jews , shunned those outside their in-group , insulting fabric community . either tell rome their gods not only wrong but evil , we might expect result . christianity leader claim " those who not hate their parents cannot my disciples " must struck rome it intended , see " new " way ( where " new " not fashionable ) , one no longer associated state religion , glue binding all other traditions . hence , christianity seen rome what it - revolution , though pliny late first / early second century , revolution barely noticed , even tolerated long christians didn't stir things up politically if turned locals adherents took one three opportunities renege faith . tipped off wilken pagles ' stellar study , " origin satan " , one finds early easy flowing style occasionally riveting exposure ancient roman world . despite its modern creation " christians " appears ( usually ) true historical analysis , not postmodern agenda . though this intermittently comes into question wilken states pliny " led exemplary life , embodying highest ideals modern rome . " repeating this theme throughout one wonders how this agrees wilken reporting pliny also executed christians casually we might deposit trash . pliny letters trajan remark executions utter disconnection , otherwise ignored it not pliny rigorous completeness typical ingratiating - not unlike executions anyone else , however . maybe that point , these " roman " standards , though wilken sound generous	1

this book excellent biography james monroe . read biographies several other founding fathers recently , i decided pick this one up well . it very thorough review our fifth president entire life . i found it well not focus monroe doctrine , showing him who he , not history remembers him , simply author doctrine . this book portrays james monroe hard working member republican party , who gradually rose through ranks become evident choice successor his friend fellow virginian , james madison . not because he charismatic or genius , but simply because he good man who served his party well , would not cause infighting amongst other members party . if you're looking learn more our early presidents , all means , pick up this book . but if you're looking book charismatic hero revolutionary era , it certainly isn't going james monroe	1
i throughly enjoyed scoop . it isn't this book some sort hallowed masterpiece nor one those brilliant , brutal satires summarizes absurd actuality particular state or belief . no , scoop just , quite simply , pure fun . story becomes rather obvious after while , but ' obvious ' not cliched or predictable manner , but keeping within consistant vein waugh narrative voice here . oh , sure , there some still relevent statements made regarding incompetence petty biases newspaper men their dictatorial bosses there clearly put case made how newspapers run wealthy industrialists who use their ownership media advance their own selfish agendas , but all this ultimately falls wayside we follow adventures boot , disinterested chronicler seemingly important events he finds himself unable even bother trying understand . this very good book , more like 4 half stars , rounded up , this rare instance , just because it made me laugh out loud more than few times . enjoy-	1

i'm surprised so many feel these cards not appropriate beginner . i suppose it depends reader objective . tarot provides answers querent questions but always positive somewhat elliptical manner . reader forced interpret insights broadest sense . it delivers answers within context how subject question fits into your general life path , interpretation complex abstract . gypsy witch deck supplies more concrete accurate answers ; it pragmatic states facts . this deck highly useful if reader desires yes/no answer or wishes provided timeframes . example , if you ask tarot your current relationship , it may reply relationship him/her important life lesson you , it happy relationship but you need ensure you don't lose your own identity . asking gypsy deck may return answer you receive proposal while vacation expect married within 11 months . this merely my opinion after years practice many would disagree my assessment . i especially like use this deck gain specific insights into other individuals ( optimal accuracy obtained if you know person birthday and/or sign ) . it also true gypsy witch cards mixture positive negative but then again isn't life ? additionally , don't feel obligated use traditional layout your readings . simple five card spreads adequate . both decks excellent tools if you find your energy or thoughts scattered ; both force reader focus . additionally , you'll find practice either deck increase your sensitivity ability empathize emotions those around you . never feel uncomfortable answers you receive , cartomancy merely allows you tap into information already contained your subconscious . there always some controversy surrounding gypsy witch cards regarding original deck , numbers deck person who created them . this information really doesn't matter since you develop your own personal intuitive rapport each card . personally , i can't see myself ever returning tarot cards since i found gypsy witch deck .	1

crick claims investigating consciousness through visual system because he believes visual system more amenable scientific investigation . those who not appreciate this tactic , he sniffily claims , not understand how science operates . it should clear why it often necessary study what experimented first , but this no way validates this particular strategy . crick approach lot like trying understand mechanics car engine studying its wheels . yes , there connection , yes , wheels lot more accessible ( especially if you haven't yet figured out how open hood ) . but you won't necessarily learn very much how engine actually works . closely connected this difficulty his refusal countenance very question what consciousness actually . course , not doing so makes his investigation visual perception `mode ' consciousness much more plausible . if one explicitly refuses define what under investigation , then investigating almost any related phenomena . unfortunately , this mindset not actually serve advance enterprise very far . crick uses glib analogy battle : war , he notes , one not get far trying define what battle when what needed troops strategy . it should go without saying this analogy so deeply flawed useless , except its intended rhetorical purpose . there no need define battle because clearly understood all out outset ; same hardly said consciousness . if one not know what battle objective , fighting it well becomes lot harder . unfortunate plight this book . more specific , it seems relatively apparent whatever else we say consciousness , it involves essentially subjective dimension . crick makes no mention this , except dismiss it something perhaps considered much later . conversely , it far apparent consciousness must involve visual awareness inherently . where this leave blind persons , one might ask ? they not fully conscious ? today we close developing sighted machines , which process navigate three-dimensional environments using lasers or stereoscopic video cameras ( e.g. , darpa challenge ) . these machines therefore approaching consciousness ? this seems patently absurd . book whole reeks lack erudition beyond narrow scientific training . we treated freshman physiology lessons neurons , brain areas basic visual processing , details which both not deep enough real scientific comprehension far more detailed than necessary advancing concepts discussed . times , it reads like undergraduate report which student eager impress not let single fact they uncovered go unreported - no matter if they actually enlighten stated aims or not . sum , most problems this book could fixed single simple but profound change : change title " primer vertebrate visual physiology " , circa 1995 . it probably would not sold many copies way , though .	1
i thought this okay book . it definitely not one my favorites , i wouldn't really recommend it . there some things i liked it some things i didn't like it . one reason i didn't like it because opening scene , main character ( rory ) outside watching her dad cut down tree their yard she talking how great tree . when i first started reading it , i like " okay , she must really like tree , " but after 20 pages her talking this tree , you get annoyed don't want read it anymore . only reason i kept reading it because it school it incredibly easy read so i kept reading . i also didn't like it because i didn't think author described things book too well . when i read book i like know what each character looks like but this story she really didn't give much what people environment like . i also didn't like how they kept talking drawing how draw everything , so got kind boring . so i finished book . it didn't get much better . but there some things i kind liked it . most book , i could really relate what rory going through . i think most girls friend they start lose , most teenage girls off-and-on relationship her parents , so that why i kept reading . way author girls act around boys teachers their parents very realistic so i think anybody reading it knows exactly what characters book going through . i think teenage girls who love draw would like this book .	1

i enjoyed this book immensely now look forward reading more holzer this period . it answered so many questions i messy circumstances surrounding slavery formation country . what i always thought such hypocrisy , i now understand it , incredible lesson human tension reality ideals -- such christian tension so true life , such grand significant scale . rather than merely acknowledging " stain " , indeed it , focus today should triumph overcoming it . his highly detailed telling , holzer over over exposes linclon myths surrounding event , themselves so revealing human tendencies . while deflating so many these myths , doing he so much explain likely origins -- often humourous , sometimes self serving , but always understandable enriching his story . not just myths . one i found particularly poignant repeated occasion son robert who exeter time speech . while it only 4 months since they seen each other , visit robert one lincoln excuses taking time incurring expense going east speak . lincoln ultimately made 10 subsequent stops speak new england his return trip exeter before heading home . while these speeches laid foundation his calculating father ultimate nomination election , robert steadfastly maintained purpose trip see him . i found very touching -- it one thing father your country , but still so your son . heart it all speech itself eager ears , eventually eyes , which took it . while lincoln personality factor , power his words what carried he day . i found this revealing tonic today politics -- altogether different america then . this democracy its best . there clearly , me least , no ideal political system , all manipulated . now hamas victors palestine , i guess even current administration might thinking this . i could go , but won't other than quote following recollection attributed lincoln which might best read thought current schooling mind : i remember how , when mere child , i used get irritated when any body talked me way i could not understand . i don't think i ever got angry anything else my life . . . i remember going my little bedroom , after hearing neighbors talk evening my father , spending no small part night walking up down , trying make out what exact meaning some their , me , dark sayings . i could not sleep , though i often tried , when i got such hunt after idea , until i caught it ; when i thought i got it , i not satisfied until i repeated it over over , until i put it language plain enough , i thought , any boy i knew comprehend . this kind passion me , it stuck me ; i am never easy now , when i am handling thought , till i bounded it north , bounded it south , bounded it east , bounded it west . perhaps accounts characteristic you observe my speeches , though i never put two things together before . ps graduate cooper union , i find holzer account cooper amazing building bit thin . plans photos available web . stage west , not north holzer says , there 18 obstructing columns , not 16 . these inaccuracies not altered my faith his account . i inserted plan hall my copy .	1
this benchmark when it comes books homes frank lloyd wright . text scholarly highly informative , while easily accessable even most nyophite wright follower . images crisp well executed , they just bleed off page . i not always huge fan wright , frankly he racist homophobe , interesting considering most his devotees taliesin where gay , man voratious ego would make donald blush . he all accounts just nasty piece work , i first found his architecture austere cold , but now i am huge admiror his work , if not man . this book shows vivid focus , what makes his homes so unique what made him american icon . i may not think much wright man , but his work ages this book simply fantastic . highly recommended .	1

although this book ostensibly " beginner " book flash actionscript ( no previous programming experience necessary ) , i got more out this book than you imagine , i'm not it yet . i've already got few favorite pages i come back again again . what struck me right off bat this book wasn't code-heavy , but much more way explanations than most books , which exactly what i seeking long time now . then , i got into it , i realized this book changing my whole way thinking coding flash actionscript , it because their heavy stress " modular " coding techniques . authors call it " black box " programming making " building blocks " code . it really encapsulation . whatever you want call it , they back it up solid examples . demonstration apply () method pages 360 361 alone worth price book ! pages 308 309 , there example making movie clip containing video controls you just drag drop into any movie , bingo ! you've got set controls movie ( play , stop , pause , fastforward , rewind ) . again , idea if you build something once , you should able reuse it , minor tweaking here there . chapter 10 , games sprites , really cool ! there fully functioning " zapper " arcade-type video game complete explanation rationale behind how something like designed coded , what variables should global , which ones belong _root , which should stay local each object ( all examples book downloaded publisher website , btw . fact , you download examples even if you haven't yet bought book ) . although lot stuff earlier chapters very basic , taking you through stuff like variables , arrays , loops , conditionals , etc , stress modularity woven throughout . main idea you come away ( certainly central idea book ) it worth time it takes design plan something modularly . even though first it take longer , end you wind up something that way easier modify . now , i say all my own perspective , i'm probably intermediate level programmer . so maybe stuff i'm saying this book it stress modularity would old hat pro . i don't know . then again , i've got 8 books actionscript , each one stuff unique itself , this one things it just aren't found others . all through book , there also ongoing project building modular flash website . i haven't gotten into working yet , but i'm sure i eventually ( i've book month ) . any case , they add little more project end each chapter , so it progresses into more advanced stuff same pace rest book . there basic introduction classes oop last chapter . it should understood it not extensive , that not focus this book anyway . it tie stress modularity , there good explanations when how you might use classes your programming . but if want material specifically classes , there other books make their focus . sum up : i would recommend this book beginner intermediate programmers . although much stuff earlier chapters probably rehash what you already know , stress modularity there beginning , there good material throughout . if you've heard modular code code reuse , but never really seen good examples it , open this book some pages i mentioned above ( 308 , 356 , 360 , 361 , 364 ) see if any it registers " aha " moment . also , if you're looking bit less code lot more explanation techniques , get this book . i also recommend " foundation actionscript animation : making things move " keith peters , same publisher	1

summer 1994 i received original hardcover version niv men devotional bible through book club . i hadn't intended use it myself , rather i thought it might make nice gift friend . after i started going through daily readings accompanying devotions , i decided keep it myself . although i've christian many years , i've always found it beyond my level self-discipline continually practice habit daily bible readings ; using this bible , i changed . although it still took me nearly two years read through one year devotional readings , me infinitely better than any other daily devotional books or bibles , none which i ever finished . since time , i am now going through it third time . i can't say enough how this edition bible changed my life . bible change anyone life , if person willing read it meditate what it says . this bible edition , first time , helped me daily basis . since i started reading it , i given it gift nearly every male friend mine , always hope they gain it some what i've received . if you'd like good taste some better devotionals , if it possible either find them on-line or your local bookstore ( walmart used carry it , even ) , i'd especially recommend looking devotions song songs ( aka " song solomon " ) . beauty devotional writings their depth breadth , which incredibly diverse . while there some readings which little challenge or encourage me , i'm more impressed how many actually . best recommendation i give this book this : any male christian who uses this bible devotional tool , reading meditating daily scripture readings , grow know , love , obey god deeper sense . i believe those who know me would agree god used this my life make me more loving sensitive , well more assertive outspoken my faith	1

this book churchill lays out his case against white progressives , who he feels oblivious ineffectiveness their efforts . he indicts them phony pacifism seeks not embrace risk confrontation state power , but rather , avoid risk entirely effort substitute feel good symbolism real change . he suggests most white progressives kidding themselves favoring revolutionary change . their simplistic ideas delusional their " comfort-zone " politics self-serving . churchill frustration rituals marching circles , " demanding " change carrying signs , lighting candles peace certainly understandable . he right such tactics impotent without force exercised somewhere else . his prescription white progressives become intimately acquainted this fact through kind " revolutionary therapy " strips away many layers pseudo-pacifist illusion very short order . churchill not call abandonment nonviolent action , merely recognition without force part equation other tactics doomed failure . i can't dispute essence what he says , but think he overplays violence angle . while not due pacifist action per se we nevertheless examples sweeping social change occurring without violent revolution . . . . . iranian revolution ( 1979 ) , collapse ussr ( 1991 ) , end apartheid . . . i think arundhati roy got it right her speech new york just after u.s. invasion iraq 2003 . she said there no way defeat empire force its component parts must isolated paralyzed one one .	1

this well-written book logically moves through certain events where america needed act , those actions either increasing or decreasing odds 9/11 happening . graham book shows bureaucratic silos focused departments themselves , rather than objectives like national security , allowed 9/11 happen . case cross-functional organizations focus intelligence security objectives well-made graham this book . i also appreciated his perspective committee chairman senate select intelligence committee . graham provides great insight into workings senate , especially also monitoring specific executive bureaucracies . while i agree him better reagan/bush/clinton/bush focus terrorism would prevented 9/11 , bush executive branch many opportunities stop 9/11 , i don't agree graham final thesis bush alone could stopped 9/11 . i would suggest however most what graham recommends happening executive branch happening , just not quickly potentially necessary since we spent spending inordinate amount men , money , material iraq rather than fighting terrorism securing our country terrorism	1
i went my university library tried compare goldrei book almost all other popular accounts set theory , prior investing my time learning basics subject . after almost finished reading it , i believe this model how textbooks mathematics should written . let me little bit more specific : 1)suberb organization material . ideas built gradually without logical gaps or regressions . definitions theorems clearly stated . " what follows what " always transparent . even choice paragraphs so well thought , one easilly assign title each them quick reference later . 2)each subject clearly introduced within its historical logical context . each theorem ( even exercise ) motivated its importance its merits global picture set theory . 3)the logic intuition behind proofs given ( well proof itself ... ) well organized not unecessarily wordy manner . 4 ) there exercises within main text ( which , usual , well motivated their importance ) solutions folowing right after . this way , one may develop skills understanding , without getting frustrated or spending too much time . there also exercises end each section which interesting not too difficult . 5 ) there comments aside main text , which range ideas concerning proof historical remarks or recommendations reader . this way , main text remains clean tangencies , but never dry . i could continue praising this book , but let me cut it short saying just this : it one those proper ( i.e. rigorous ) math textbooks invite you read each following chapter turn each page see what next . finished it i feel i pretty firm understatnding basics . i only wish goldrei could write second book specialized topics ( say , similar topics covered devlin " joy sets " , or moschovakis ' book ) , same energy enthousiasm wrote this one	1

sadly , chicago poems ( 1916 ) , author first published work , book which self-styled folk poet carl sandburg best remembered today . collection takes hard unswerving look grim realities urban life common man , funneled through flume author committed socialist ideological perspective . such approach poetry may somewhat novel america time , both history critics kind sandburg sympathetic portraits human suffering . but whether he addressing " dago shovelman , " immigrant who forgotten dignified his ancestors europe or who no longer recognize " new-mown hay smell calling wind , " street walker " haggard poems desperate eyes , " or young woman burned death factory fire , sandburg continually adopts simplistic notion lower economic strata society always victimized but virtuous , while governmental institutions , bosses all stripes , professional classes , wealthy uniformly cruel , oppressive , exploitive , , best , indifferent . thus , chicago poems reads like 132-page polemic very narrow political point view . while many author observations poignantly insightful ( such poverty-stricken family dead boy ' right grief , ' who " glad it gone , rest family now more eat wear " ) , poems , when read together , take oppressively unbalanced character their own . ' fence , ' example , " rabble all vagabonds hungry men wandering children looking place play " stand outside gates newly constructed " stone house lake front " built wealthy man , who , poet infers , nothing but immoral , amoral , or corrupt . author usher-esque vision , nothing able pass through gates property except " death rain tomorrow . " tomorrow , such corrupt individual or family , inevitably bring nothing but waves bad conscience fevered isolation . ' soiled dove ' examines life woman who " not harlot until she married corporation lawyer , " but who automatically becomes one acquiescing such marriage , who soon discovers her husband also loves " six other women , " if marital infidelity limited exclusively upper economic classes . contrast , ' happiness ' confidently represented " crowd hungarians under trees their women children keg beer accordion , " image which may seem simultaneously na�ve , patronizing , condescending many readers . occasionally , sandburg wisely acknowledges some portion tragedies man existence simply inherent natural human life cycle . " hand god " also comes blame several poems . chicago poems most effective when sandburg bypasses social divisionalism -- he often his later volumes poetry -- simply addresses everyman individual . while these poems often infused lyrical tender sentimentality slightly reminiscent james whitcomb riley , they also locate acknowledge beautiful within tragedies perpetually arise human frailty , vulnerability , mortality . ' dream dusk , ' author warns " tears loss broken dreams may find your heart dusk , " while ' under harvest moon ' identifies " death " " gray mocker , [ who ] comes you beautiful friend who remembers . " ' i sang ' describes lover who given up his heart " you moon , " but " only moon remembers , kind me . " other poems more pronounced folk character sandburg later volumes . speaker ' theme yellow ' pumpkin , who celebrates paganistic dance children around him " last day october ... singing ghost songs love harvest moon ... i am jack-o-lantern terrible teeth children know i am fooling . " most recent edition complete poems carl sandburg ( 2003 ) , which contains chicago poems its entirety , 832 pages long , provides its readership full range sandburg original often gloriously rich sensual vision life . it also contains works like ' gates tombs , ' slabs sunburnt west ( 1922 ) , which sandburg , " crazy wild dreamer , " more fully maturely developed his political vision . comparatively , reductive , often despairing chicago poems reads like immaturely polarized work it .	1

murray rothbard _education : free compulsory_ sketchy tirade against public education system . rothbard -- free-market libertarian-anarchist conservative social leanings -- begins observation government movers shakers control indoctrinate populace use education apparatus . illustrate his point , cover features wwii era poster american schoolchildren collecting supplies us military , " schools war " prominently displayed . rothbard traces first advocates state funded education protestant reformation when secular rulers wanted maintain protestant faith state religions . country developed most comprehensive public education program , mandatory attendance , prussia , whose government rothbard somewhat unfairly characterizes overly despotic . american education establishment , rothbard notes , praised prussian model brought extensive state mandated compulsory education system us during course 19th 20th centuries . ulterior motive education establishment use government schools indoctrinate nation children loyalty state rather than allowing them develop educate themselves independently direct parental involvement . regimes most openly opposed individual freedom , like communist russia nazi germany , made no secret their intention use public schools inculcate loyalty government programs . rothbard cites fact not all children comfortable academic environment instead points toward decentralized system technical training , skilled labor vocational education , similar apprentice system . this would suit needs what naturally inherently diversified stratified population rather than forcing all children into public schools , which often negative influence because social problems students exposed them ( drug addictions , sex , gangs , etc ) . rothbard also brings into question many modern teaching techniques schools which downgrade individual reasoning capacity ( i.e. , not sticking basic reading , writing arithmetic ) instead teach students using images group projects . he also says schools should abolish " frills " like physical education like keep students more consistently focused academics . it clear any one interested this question public schools propagandizing children ( especially regards environmentalism , anti-religion , multiculturalism " holocaustianity " us ) . rothbard somewhat over-reactionary his blanked condemnation all public education , but he raise some valid questions regarding disorientating , anti-family agenda compulsory education america	1

i've seen word " macabre " used lot reviews eugenides first novel , i think it appropriate , but all its darkness this certainly novel heart . bleak cynicism its portrait middle-class cluelessness ( community inability understand or care its teenage daughters ; flailing , insincere attempts " deal " tragedy through therapy both official inofficial memorials untimely death ; flimsiness individuals ' concern their neighbors , 20th-century american suburbs claim " neighborhoods , " through which desperate sense fear self-preservation constantly breaking ) balanced uncharacteristic tenderness teenage boys who observe five doomed lisbon sisters unrequited longing closest thing this lifestyle offers true love . i read eugenides second novel , middlesex , while ago , enjoyed it very much , but i think i liked virgin suicides better . i trying explain what i liked better it , fumbling how middlesex sprawling narrative-oriented this weirder somehow something other than story , but it won't quite give up what , he much better job articulating what i trying say : " it sounds , " he said , " like virgin suicides modernist , while middlesex victorian . " duh--that exactly it . then this morning , i came across interview eugenides ( his onetime student , jonathan safran foer ) , which he says , " i always say it like this : my generation writers grew up backwards . we weaned modernism only later read great 19th-century masters realism . when we began writing high school college , it experimental fiction . i think now certain kind academic experimental fiction reached dead end . middlesex postmodern book many ways , but it also very old-fashioned . reusing classical motifs fundamental postmodern practice , course , but telling story isn't always . i like narrative . i read it write it .

reading dark harbor like watching mediocre tv show you can't bothered turn off . i listened dark harbor audio book , so i don't feel too badly wasting my time it because i `read it ' while i doing other things anyway , like driving . if you looking something feels fresh new - dark harbor not you . this novel innovative episode murder she wrote . illustrate : stone barrington his cronies quickly deduce apparent suicide must murder because gun found victim wrong hand . ( i think i actually saw one murder she wrote ) woods either can't bothered come up new idea or he simply doesn't care . it clear early who responsible murders dark harbor . this isn't because clues come together any logical way , but rather because predictable nature novel . you just tell . this doesn't mean solution makes sense . fact , there huge inconsistencies plot make ending feel forced . it if woods couldn't bothered think all his plot lines through . woods compelled include his regular characters novel even though they little ( except course , sex stone ) . holly barely says word her first trip island . her second trip she obligatory romp stone then gets kidnapped remainder novel . why she kidnapped ? i don't think anyone - including woods - answer question any plausible way . my theory woods needed work holly into plot decided putting her peril would allow him fill few pages . it also allowed him include holly dad ( regular character ) her search . wood motive seems obvious . kidnapper motive however isn't - her kidnapping makes no sense . but clearly this something woods didn't think worth worrying . best i say this novel it quick easy read ( course , my case it read me ) . it may not worth time trouble actually read ( certainly not buy ) - but audio book library ( limited selection audio books choose ) it helped me pass time traffic .	1

i just read princess goblin this evening , it wonderful book which i highly recommend . this book , george macdonald , masterful story teller ( note : he not necessarily good writer , but he good story teller ) , tells story irene princess . irene embodyment innocence , macdonald book , innocence hero . not only story iteself imaginative just plain good reading , but it also point , something which many today fictional books seem lacking . point summed up something irene grandmother said : " seeing not believing : seeing only seeing . " i think george macdonald trying provide picture faith . we not believe blindly , many existentialist postmodernist church members would tell us , irene see feel string which guides her , well her grandmother . however , others , who not yet faith ( curdie ) cannot see or feel line until they believe it . effect , macdonald saying we cannot see feel ( metaphorically ) god directly until we believe him . notice , however , while curdie could not directly see string , he could see effects string . he saw evidence string existed , then he later concluded since he saw evidence string , he should believe string grandmother who gave it . then , after believing , he saw string . this very good picture conversion it should . one first sees evidence god , whether through lives christians or through arguments , or both . then one believes , only after one believes one really " know " god . macdonald " good " ( good , not his well writen books ) much better than most authors ' . . . lewis himself said george macdonald portrays good better than any other auther he knew . . . lewis ' good kind somehow , more powerful fierce , though no less loving , kind , compassionate . all truth , i prefer . . lewis ' incarnation good alsan macdonald irene grandmother , but both extremely good . somehow it seems irene grandmother not strong one would like good though . conclusion , fact george macdonald managed take topic faith , wrap it rich garb childrens story , it adored world amazing feat . i am very much looking forward reading sequel , princess curdie , which i hope very soon	1

i've this book little over month now am 20% way through . book nothing but problems , 1125 all , clear diagrams highly accurate solutions algebraic notation . goal book build up your recognition tactical patterns . achieve this , problems annotated not motif , but difficulty . goal work through all problems relatively quickly . if you get stuck , look up answer move . general problems progress difficulty , but patterns built up working earlier problems help solve harder ones later . marking difficulty allows one decide when " give up " look solution , unlike reinfeld book example , where you never know if you simply blind , or you've hit one really hard problems . this book no hints ... no " spot pin " , no " white just opened position , why this mistake ? " . so general practice it little more realistic . this book not explain motifs . if you want , try nunn " learn chess tactics " or one similar books polgar , littlewood etc . these books also better if you find you weakness particular motif want practice just one ( my favorite here , muller " chesscafe puzzle book " ) . key , though they not labelled such , problems organized motif pattern . you move through problems you come across series closely related positions . example , you might get 10 back rank mates row , then 10 knight forks . i often find i hit first these , struggle bit ( though usually first series one easier ones ) , then second one quicker because pattern starting establish itself , so . so book really contain " hints " , but my experience discovering pattern yourself cements it more than it explained then exercising series examples . me least , this approach seems work better than classic reinfeld books , " sharpen your tactics " replaced them my bedside	1

forget wagner , whose disgruntled cacophony posing music nicely dispatched oscar wilde one his plays comparative quip when somebody rings old disturbingly noisy doorbell . forget wagner because birth tragedy greatest work art criticism ever written . it also , despite print century , underexplored gold mine artists intellectuals . this nietzsche first book : it contains en ovo thoughts this great writer thinker who formative influence heidegger through him derrida , two greatest post-nietzschean philosophers . nietzsche great theme infinite possibility opened up greek culture 6th century b.c. , time heraclitus birth tragedy-the culture spawned not only democracy science but which , like brood many eggs only some which hatched ( or quantum possibility before measurement " collapses " wave function into reality)-much more besides -- culture beside whose tragedic productions ( aeschylus sophocles , not euripedes , whom nietzsche shows lost touch essence tragedy ) modern cultural productions not only not measure up , but often seem best , nietzsche says , like " caricature . " loss art traced nietzsche itself-well , not tragic , no-less than tragic : sad let us say . not only highly creative artist-like philosopher , but multilingual philologist who read ancient greek original , nietzsche beams his laser-like analysis astounding clarity into this lost realm possibility . it if he stuck bookmark into tome time , showing us very best part otherwise often dry rather bad ( perhaps overly long ! ) book which we collectively author , called culture . what crucial emphasize nietzsche conclusion ( or assumption ) ( its most famous line ) " existence only justified aesthetic phenomenon . " thus ancient greek tragedy not just random subject , or one art form among others . it aesthetic experience par excellence , greatest overcoming perils existence into worthy production art humans ever developed . nietzsche links success aeschylean sophoclean tragedy brief fruitful intercourse ( like men women , which keeps new people coming despite often-fractious sexual relationships ) two aesthetic strains . one he identifies greek messenger god sun , apollo , other dismembered god wine , dionysos . dionysos also not one god among others . rather , it him all ( originally religious ) tragedies devoted , nietzsche tells us , when other actors appeared sacred precursor greek stage they not taken realistic but avatars , idealized other versions , dionysos . now most crucial thing realize dionysos " he " split into pieces his split pieces represent fundamental , contradictory , fact universe : although all one ( borrow philosophical truism ) this one split into many . this primordial splitting ( cf . heidegger distinction individual beings ) , according nietzsche , regarded ancient greeks itself ur-source human suffering . dionysos tears came mankind , his smile gods . now nietzsche says apollinian aesthetic strain manifests clarity dreams-which show discrete-although ultimately illusory-images . these images similar those appear before chorus ( crucial tragedy but dispensed euripedes ) , before spectators , form actors tragic spectacle . thus tragical spectacle displayed shows itself dreamlike illusion culture , not representation reality per se . just , after we stare sun , we see spots before our eyes so , nietzsche says , after we stare into abyss we see tragedy its chorus ideal human characters . dionysian element nietzsche identifies drunkenness dissolution , opposite clarity dream imagery , made public greek stage . dionysian sense represents one , or movement individual ( seen la schopenhauer vedic metaphysics mayan illusion universe " i " itself ) back one ; apollinian illusory clarity skin-encapsulated individual . ( nietzsche own individuality , brain , compromised treponema spirochetes , real dionysian avatars syphilis eventually killed him . ) one most fascinating things nietzsche exquisitely crafted analysis way it shows science , no less than euripides , motivated socrates ' false humility dreams total knowledge . " who this demigod ? " nietzsche asks socrates-whose reign reasonableness , passed plato , aristotle , church scholastics-defines much modern world . socrates created secular tradition , raising knowledge over aesthetics giving mysticism bad name . nietzsche points out plato burnt his plays after coming into contact his teacher-and compromise , platonic dialogues , fact prototype new , socratized art form-the novel . thus , startlingly nietzsche suggests novel itself debased form art-a euripideanized , socratized attempt make primal aesthetic experience more representative , reasonable , realistic . euripedes ( he later recanted , but his influence went ) dispensed tragic core stagecraft , today we accept drama individual characters all their oddity imperfections-rammed us unremittingly hegemony plot wordy deus ex machina explanations aesthetically poisonous , hyperrationalistic aftermath euripides socratic capitulations . sum , today we all but forgotten dionysian origins acting-more real than realism-which originally centered around not fleeting emotions empathy , but central cosmological fact individuals tragic separation all . highly recommended	1
if you wish read something entertainment sake , then this book suffice . written english professor , this book lacks sort critical thought those us science deptartments want . purportedly ' abbreviated history western manhood , ' it rather exercise academic arcana - attempt think something through its opposite or , this case , its abuse . one hardly compelled reconsider ideas what manhood means . there nothing taylor " treatise " support such nonsense , " this specter haunted men centuries : fear manhood become , or already become , obsolete , superfluous , ridiculous , best quaint , worst disgusting . " really ? whose misandrist manifesto ? concept " western man " , after all , just - concept . there no such unified homogeneous group no such " specter " haunted it so long . men should cringe word castration less mystery than than why women should fear rape . short , taylor analysis history purposes castration sheds less light " cultural construct masculinity " than sadistic sexual abuse humiliation which males threatened subjugated . some his readers find him witty or funny times only because taylor treatment his subject often sophmoric . my view , today attitudes toward manhood males best understood terms our lacking moral sympathies toward them . taylor book no exception . we not generation influenced freud so much feminism . thus , historical abuse mutilation women subject deadly serious pertinent us while sexual abuse humiliation men treated like something never happened - , something we've misconstured , or , tayor case , given fictional reinterpretation , mocked trivalized . taylor ignorant belief ( not first person , course ) sexual prowess eunuchs one case point . case point tayor view most western history castration mark power divinity , ultimate abrogation sexual desire , wide spread currency among christian metaphysicians . this nonsense . taylor arguing anecdotally his own foregone conclusions . he wasn't there take any polls . no doubt , some christian cults managed appropriate practices sexual mutilation already place - just christian nihilism helped make slavery seem worthy . this not , however , make such practices any more agreeable hardly anyone wanted suffer either condition themselves . any case , spiritualized feelings attained some christian monks through self mutilation would appalled greeks - paragons western civilization - it most men throughout all human history . taylor book castration score few points concept cultural relativism subject now seems , best , uncontroversial or , worst , comic immature . should he chose write volumes exploring gamut humanity attitudes regarding every other form sexual nastiness , he no doubt find endless tolerance feted well . would he dare ?	1

this definitive work impracticality , impossibility immorality socialism . von mises , who observed socialism first hand before flee his home europe , who lived through age great collectivist experiments , written simply devastating critique . ( supposed ) reader below who wrote review entitled " propogating utopian fallacies " , obviously either not read book , or completely misunderstood entire thing . more ignorant review this book hardly imagined . he makes several dubious assumptions his review attributes them von mises . he makes statements like , " mises doesn't understand , " or " mises believes " then proceeds use these statements try refute idea free markets . he also fails apply his own logical excercises himself . example he states if mises consistent , he would rejected all government not just some collectivist programs . yet reviewer seems believer half-way system where markets mixed socialism , " democracy " , government intervention . i guess he must monopoly believing governments should some things leave others anarchy market . anyone familair rest mises works free market libertarian theory general can't help but laugh claims he makes . this reviewer clearly not understand property rights based , modern anarchist theory ( opposed rage against machine variety which he makes reference ) , nor he understand this book . claims he makes last paragraph his reveiw so outlandish naive they not even warrant response . important lesson gained here though . without some prior ( correct ) understanding concepts like markets , anarchy , liberty , true nature government , without some understanding logical processes , it easy fall prey such overly-simplified arguments . i would recommend this book , also reading other books authors such mises , murray rothbard , henry hazlitt , f.a. hayek	1

i highly pleased read loeb lee batman : hush . artistry rivals japanese manga story line rich internal detail . reader exposed ( me first ) insights batman mind . throughout story , we know what he feeling what he worries . there times , however , where internal narration gets way real-time events . example , batman fighting same panel , he thinking someone else . hush good story new batman fans , though . loeb new readers favor explaining new old characters albeit some may find practice boring . catwoman also need some development . much i found her intriguing , i'd like see more justice-seeking catwoman , catwoman who fights so ardently weak cannot stand see injustice prevail . also , i would disagree few reviewers regarding plot twists . maybe they meant bring many dc characters into story possible , i found this practice entertaining . it new thing see old villains used new ones show how easily old villain insecurities weaknesses exploited . this approach made old villains appear more human than plastic characters we so used seeing televised batman series . ( before you rip my head off , batman series come long way , so don't think i consider batman villains plastic they not so cartoon series they 1960 television series ) . bottom line : great read , nearly masterpiece . it easy new batman fans become acquainted this fandom since new old characters explained . we also exposed inner workings batman mind , slight oversight frank miller batman : year one , however annoying times . catwoman character bit limited her saucy flirtatious ways , though she not fail amuse . above all , great read well worth time .	1

talented mr . ripley , written 1955 , patricia highsmith created fictional character memorable john updike rabbit angstrom or arthur miller willie loman just american tom ripley . she taken theme used so often american fiction writers hawthorne henry james innocent american traveling europe turned it upside down since ripley , who travels italy other places europe , anything but blameless he murders get what he wants . this novel so much more than conventional crime novel . highsmith writes beautiful , to-the-point prose totally engages reader ripley exploits . her writing reminiscent both henry james poe -- early novel herbert greenleaf asks tom if he read james ' ambassadors . he reply he not -- she tell chilling tale any writer i think . even though most us probably pretty good idea how novel end , since two films made it -- french film en plein soleil ( 1960 ) talented mr . ripley ( 1999) -- we share tom fears concerns -- realizing we should know better -- he tells one lie after cover his murderous tracks , piling one indiscretion but always landing his feet . highsmith presents classic love triangle twist . marge , whom ripley detests describes her figure " gourdlike , " love well-off dickie greenleaf dislikes distrusts ripley , believing he , language times , " sexual deviant .

rawls nozick responsible reinvigorating rights-based liberalism 20th century , saving political philosophy mere in-fighting among utilitarians , superstitions marxism . political philosophy since largely response rawls nozick . this work genius , though it frequently misunderstood , perhaps purpose . most readers , including important philosophers like thomas nagel , simply misunderstand argumentative structure , result many famous criticisms book irrelevant . nozick thesis minimal state justified , but more than minimal state cannot , except under unusual situations . part i book addressed other libertarians , specifically market anarchists ( also called anarcho-capitalists ) . such , nozick assumes libertarian rights self-ownership ( or self-governance ) . basically , nozick wants show market anarchists minimal state arise without violating anybody rights , where rights question things all parties debate agree we . so , he describes scenario which security companies come inevitably natural monopolies over geographic areas . after providing highly original analysis nature risk its moral implications , plus hugely important discussion side constraints moral prohibitions , nozick establishes such monopoly would legitimately prohibit other security firms independent enforcers operating its area , provided it compensates everyone involved . most natural form compensation free security . nozick then argues equilibrium occur which security all provided analogue coercive taxation . end this section , nozick , provided argument successful ( there good reasons think it not ) established agency provided court , military , police services geographic area arise without violating rights without explicit intention creating state . very common misreading nozick occurs here . many philosophers think nozick believes only state arise this manner this form ( security company private shareholders ) legitimate . nozick didn't think this isn't committed it . instead , what he believes he shown both minimal state desirable ( it would arise unintentionally result spontaneous order because it superior market anarchy ) legitimate . nozick then say this leaves open whether state democratic what way . second part book meant challenge arguments more than minimal state . it also misunderstood , even very smart people . nozick not assume libertarian rights part ii , though he refers them times . instead , his argument consists three factors . first , he primarily addresses egalitarian liberals ( hereafter e-liberals ) . e-liberals believe rights personal freedoms ( sexual activity , etc . ) justified , but hold economic activity controlled government decree . nozick examines e-liberals reasons wanting more-than-minimal state ( such welfare state or social democracy ) , debunks them drawing analogies economic activity e-liberal would regulate personal freedoms e-liberal desires leave free . if e-liberal cannot identify morally salient difference , she forced either deny personal freedom , thus becoming authoritarian , or admit economic activity should remain free , thus conceding nozick point . style argument used part ii what i call " liberal presumption " argument . liberal presumption any human activity ought remain unregulated laws unless some strong reason shown regulate activity . ( this contrasted against authoritarian presumption , which mussolini stalin held , namely any activity ought governed unless strong reason shown let it free . ) nozick addresses e-liberals , who hold liberal presumption , then attacks reasons they offer support regulating various activities . he shows reasons based misunderstandings bad arguments , thus restoring liberal presumption . last type argument not rely this presumption . nozick addresses marxists , instance , who not liberals . his arguments against them consists mostly just showing what wrong their position . instance , marxist exploitation theory crucially depends upon bad economic theory , such labor theory value , something which shown false back early 1870s . ( almost all contemporary economists would agree nozick this . marxism smart people what creationism dumb people , pseudo-science . ) result these arguments show more than minimal state cannot justified . way , part ii , nozick provides us some gems . he gives first major critique rawls . critique devastating , nozick points out mistakes rawls reasoning ( simple logical errors , etc . ) leave rawls ' project ungrounded . rawls , some reason , never responded this critique . nozick also analyzes envy , provides hypothetical histories arrive more than minimal state uncover its nature ( it logically equivalent system which we all own parts each other ) . he also sketches theory justice holdings contrast rawls , dworkin , others . this theory , entitlement theory , very rough , but it provides welcome alternative simplistic theories maintaining all there justice establishing patterns ownership . part iii least often read least understood part book . partly , it provides contractarian argument libertarianism ( see loren lomasky article david schmidtz ' book , robert nozick , contemporary philosophy focus ) . it thus contains some foundations nagel claims nozick lacks ( though this criticism based nagel mistaken reading . ) part iii , nozick asks us try construct system allows experimentation which everyone , despite their differences , find society allows them live out their conceptions good . system best approaches this libertarian framework , inside which non-libertarian communities may established provided they respect other , different communities . part iii sketchy , but contains seeds brilliant things , it too bad it hasn't explored more . overall , i would say argument part i weakest , part ii strongest , part iii most interesting ripe philosophical potential . if you care political philosophy , you owe it yourself read this book . you also owe it yourself understand it . if you find yourself thinking nozick making dumb mistake or begging question , you've misunderstood . but you'll good company	1

i rated this book " two " relation other koontz books i read . book entertaining enough , but not very unique relation other books koontz written . koontz appears somewhat formula when creating main charachters . often there primary charachter who appears rather basic beginning , but through later description becomes more complex due unusual background . koontz books often aforementioned charachter utilize their unusual background overcome difficult obstacles usually order save loved one . i believe koontz tries express certain generalties , some which moral religious undertones : end , good overcomes evil often evil its destructive nature , destroys itself . love worth fighting dieing . love stronger than evil . what not kill you , makes you stronger . evil knows no socioeconomic boundaries . key happiness love , not material gain . evil lurks where you least expect it	1

franken well-known political journalist america . this book billed funny , but after i got it ways , i decide better word hilarious . franken uses humour bring out points he making while exposing political economic mismanagement other misdemeanours -- even some felonies way . this first book i read franken . he known primarily his journalism , since 2004 , his travelling radio talk show politics current events . this book provided extensive laughter , arising american political situation , always productive source humour satire . other side evil nefarious underbelly washington , corruption , dirty tricks , outright lies - not officials people -- power trades ignore weak powerless . author uncovers big deals powerful people purposely rip off american indians under guise getting them favors washington . likewise american mariana islands , bilked no less than america family man house speaker tom delay . franken manages make his points laughter while providing extensive documentation every area he deals , starting fomr presidential election 2004 . his jewish humour enhances his insightful satirical commentary american politics . self-proclaimed liberal , he provides particularly entertaining portrayal right-wing bush administration shenanigans related cronies factions . he discusses details some most unbelievable programs dishonesty dirty tricks history . i especially liked sections discussing how money certain gambling interests one state used fund church-led opposition gambling interests state . franken provides extensive documentation lines details relationships some greatest corrupt politicians washington prominent " religious " leaders like ralph reed " christian coalition . " amazing shocking , even beyond what we already could see suspicion freely public information . franken also compiled large body material related iraq war . one very interesting aspect well-documented trail plans bush administration invade iraq , before 9-11 . plan actively discussed british least early july 2002 , year before public plans made after us congress un discussions . administration insiders report administration discussions invasion possiblities early january 2001 . note this before 9-11 . actually minutes diplomatic meeting 10 downing street us uk officials published uk press discussed widely . extensive subterfuge misdirection characterizes bush plans iraq invasion , even after detailed us international evidence , there no tie al qaeda baath regime sadaam hussein . they find other reasons invade . but invasion goal , all they needed excuse . it not we didn't think these things happened , but here we it lined out heavily documented detail . it sad commentary administration whose rhetoric followed line clean-up , honesty , interests people family values . no wonder prestige credibility usa plummeted bottom under bush administrations . every american ought read evidence presented here , not just entertainment , especially when baldfaced claims right-wing [ so-called " conservative " ] media moguls provide such astonishing absurdity . but we appreciate here excellent documentation provided this conscientious patriot journalist awaken world real situation . challenging , but rewarding read .	1

yourself favor - don't waste your time this book	-1
i rarely glad finish any book i this one . it vitriolic diatribe long allegation short substance . author wellknown extreme leftist this book just more same . he hates george . bush , republicans , business people , americans general . this really nothing more than poorly smear job all kinds people mr. moore despises . it extremely poorly documented . moore uses some footnotes chapter one , but not use any throughout rest book . even footnotes he use based upon dubious sources . included among those several books written bush haters . he even cites al jazeera source . i quite surprised i didn't see national enquirer listed among his ' reliable ' sources . some moore rants so contradictory they really quite pathetic . one section he claims osama bin laden unlikely planned or directed 9/11 attacks . he said bin laden dialysis cave afghanistan ( must some cave . bat cave perhaps ? ) just few pages later , moore incensed some bin laden relatives allowed leave united states after 9/11 attacks without questioned fbi . i am wondering why they would need questioned since moore so convinced bin laden didn't direct attacks . he thinks saudi arabian government it . yet part book , moore gives us his ' plan ' getting things back track . his first item listed ' catch osama bin laden . ' why ? moore doesn't think bin laden 9/11 . why worry him ? absurdity moore rantings his claim media biased favor iraq war . i don't know where he getting his news but it sure isn't abc , cbs , nbc , cnn , washington post , new york times , or any other establishment press . moore also thinks most terrorists ' homegrown ' united states . evidently he hasn't followed current events last 30 years . excluding timothy mcveigh , moore would hard pressed list any other ' homegrown ' terrorists . yet spot , he carries long time saying there no terrorist threat . he claims any concerns terrorists just manufactured bush administration excuse violate rights everyone world , keep himself power , etc . very bizarre position moore takes this book his advocacy his ideal presidential candidate - oprah winfrey . while i'm sure she very nice person , she seems like odd choice presidential candidate . she talk show host . should she not selection , he thinks tom hanks would great choice . again , i'm sure he very nice person , but not how we pick presidents . this one position alone shows moore not serious commentator or worthy his views considered reasonable people . i could go inaccuracies this book . suffice it say , it merely rantings extreme partisan who little regard truth .	-1

i've just read through couple other reviews here ( which i sometimes ) i say i agree some more nasty reviews , though i disagree their conclusions . parker really disciplined writer , someone who writes fast ( reportedly he 20-25 pages day , now , three books plus year ) cleanly , without almost any extraneous plot or characters his work . he back form lately ( apaloosa very good ) this his latest spenser book , part what got longest running series detective fiction these days . they can't give him any more awards ( i think they made him grand master mystery writers guild or whatever it decade or so ago ) so he just soldiers , putting his grandchildren through harvard piling up cds . what makes book good one points where i agree some reviewers . i don't particularly agree susan weakness series : frankly parker portrayal spenser , what made character unique early , he * isn't * loner . departure chandler , hammett , ross john . macdonald , all other private eye writers up 60s . idea one those writers character permanent relationship almost inconceivable ( exception hammett nick nora charles , but they only thin man ) so parker breaking mold when he . it also generally agreed almost splitting detective character twain adding hawk alter ego spenser brilliant . this book avoids both those plot conventions parker , many ways more traditional book , though course setting even plot much more contemporary than any above-mentioned author books . plot rather pretty much standard parker . there school shooting , somehow one shooters got away . other caught , gave up his friend . grandmother second boy very wealthy determined , hires spenser look into matter , prove her grandson innocent . spenser , course , can't prove anything sort , but he try find out why whole thing happened , something cops can't determine . i enjoyed this book great deal . i said , it somewhat more characteristic earlier works , but i think if i read book without spenser or any other names it , i still would able tell who author . writing style very distinctive	1
i asked this book because i thought it would give advice how raise daughters -- it -- more . dr. northrup begins explaining how mothers daughters connected through generations , how we only create healthy relationship our daughter when we heal our relationship our mother . we heal ourselves , we heal all women who gone before us . this only sample some insight she offers into our relationships women . i'll admit i surprised holistic approach she takes , but am glad she offers insight , i'm only vaguely familiar some ideas/theories believe i more grow area . rather than book geared towards raising children ( i've read my share -- i thought that what this book would ) i would categorize this book self-help book geared toward strengthening creating healthy relationship your mother daughter . very pleased everything i've read	1

i enjoyed this book but not much halberstam great " summer ' 49 . " book yankees red sox , " october 1964 " takes you through yankees ' cardinals ' respective seasons , regular focuses individual players , scouts , managers owners . title , then , bit misleading , you don't get october world series until near end book . that fine , except whereas " summer ' 49 " two teams fighting each other all season long al pennant , " october 1964 " follows two teams two different leagues , who didn't face each other until series . halberstam evident intent present two teams contrast : rigidly conservative , declining yankees opposed young , hustling , racially integrated cardinals . it almost works , but end it like reading two separate books - chapter or two cardinals , then back yankees , cardinals , yankees , etc ., until end , when they finally take same playing field . gives book bit disjointed feel robs it some intensity " summer ' 49 . " still , portraits personalities involved engaging , reader gets good feel state professional baseball circa 1964 , making this must-read any lover baseball history	1

i tried embrace this book -- i really . it tempting want last found piece academic writing deftly encapsulates explains this clash titans : jihad globalism . barber main title , however , more tantalizing than explanatory . this book demonstrates dangers allegiance dichotomies ; there other forces work society grapple headline-stealing titans . this important book least insofar it captures growing sentiment among academics interested socio-economic forces compel current events . it not , therefore , easy read layman ( particularly last part book ) which ironic given his call grassroots citizen action . barber asserts -- really insists uncomfortable brand academic arrogance -- almost narrowly political overtones world immersed battle opposing ideologies : corporate , amoral homogenized one really without ideology local , or tribal , rigidly moral fragmented one part ideology , part myth-making . unfortunately , his earnestness construct defend his convenient dichotomy , he conforms exceptions his rule . jihadists -- whether ethnic hatemongers or terrorists -- barber retained some residue moral dignity while globalist -- whether gullible , materialistic indifferent consumers or manipulative , multinational executives -- altogether lost their moral compass . his solution ( which he fails outline , thus making his work more polemic manifesto rather than manual change ) activist citizenry fully appreciative their need ability shore up civil sector modern societies . here again barber remiss , revealing writing one desk rather than field its limitations . he fails acknowledge , example , extent which lack civic tradition such nations russia china impedes social progress sort he pines . following further indicates his lack awareness chinese cultural resiliency : " what striking even here where native culture might thought its greatest chances against children western enlightenment , mcworld seems irresistible .

sadly , wright throws up facade his evangelical readership early christian resurrection stories should taken literal historically defensible . should we expect anything different someone socio-religiously tethered his own conservative community market ? wright foists upon his readers technical propaganda aimed certifying myths his modern western religious tradition . his often grossly dishonest use primary literature characterizes his overt , evangelical program book . this work not open historical inquiry , but apology sold his already deluded market . one redeeming value work wright surveys large array ancient literary sources , so one gains substantial list primary references investigation . if , however , you wish read far more balanced work topic , might i recommend . riley resurrection reconsidered . riley true classicist scholar nascent christian traditions , not traditionalist or apologist . evangelicals somehow still get away same ploy . idea goes something like this : larger my book , more erudite authoritative it its reception ( e.g. bock commentary luke larger than pacbell phone book ) . let honest one thing . wright not produced this volume larger scholarly world . he plainly written work insulate his own evangelical market realities found careful investigation question tabled . since most never read 1000 ancient works ( their original languages ) required even weigh his argument properly , evangelical world becomes falsely satisfied wright dealt matter handily .	1

most reviews i written amazon based books , dvds , cds i already own . i occasionally buy new product via amazon , but i mostly review stuff i already own . i own this book ... this play because i read it while humanities course college . i went college rather " late " life ... whatever means ... yet i derived more experience than i probably would i gone right after high school . i am one those people who believe it not college makes " well-rounded " indivividual , but life experience . if colleges universities handed out degrees based life experience , i'd probably doctorate three times over ... we given assignment reading this play seeing live production college i attending just so happened putting . my primary focus philosphy , i embraced existentialism unit we now focused upon . my best friend , who was/is " atheist " less receptive these existentialist ideas he considered strange elusive . you think he , atheist , would more open them than i who already bitten metaphysics/spirituality plague . truth told i think only reason he says he atheist because he cheapskate doesn't want shell out extra money christmas gifts . so we go see this play people getting pretty agitated . this play everything goes round round but never arrives any final conclusions i noticed how we , society , love our answers . we not soothed questions proposistions " what if ? " scenarios . we feel need latch onto something because something better than nothing . isn't it ? existentialists believe universe random , chaotic , ultimately meaningless so sense they " give " meaning meaninglessness . just like atheist believes non-belief . you see , human species cannot not give meaning his/her life ... we cannot not believe ... we " pretend " life without meaning we don't believe but everything falls onto screen our perception , take shape our perceptions . i loved this play . i loved merry-go-round type dialouge . isn't this what we all ? we get belief so engrained our heads we think it only way believe so we spend lot time trying convince someone who may not receptive our point view why it valid . what i learned over years only reason why belief valid because we ones who validate it . it doesn't make us " more right " than person who doesn't believe it , it just makes us believers belief . contrary popular opinion , more people you who also believe same way you believe not prove it any more valid than if only one person believed i t.t his play not dissolve me into puddle desperation futileness , fact it added more meaning my life which would probably make samuel beckett gag . it made me fall love even more this crazy life only i live . nobody lives proxy . each us liberated imprisoned our beliefs . best we ever hope determined what we willing believe any given time . this why it good practice sit down journal your beliefs time time question why you still believe what you believe . you may outgrown certain beliefs , certain ideas , certain ways world but don't like two " bums " play , don't keep postponing what it you eventually desire see ; see it now , live it now , it now . if you going atheist , best atheist you . if you going christian , best christian you . if you going anarchist , best anarchist you . just don't think everyone going believe exactly you believe don't make others wrong simply because they may point view . end , none us truly know what other side . yes , we've people near death experiences , but nobody ever come back after completely dead report , we just reports people who " mostly dead " . take life grain salt enjoy ride . peace blessings .	1

you ever get impression author trying just little too hard get attention their librarian readers ? i don't think this happens much world adult literature , but when it comes kiddie lit , writers sometimes verge shameless . now i willing look past kimberly willis holt paean glory librarians everywhere " part me " , non-fiction true tale librarian heroism , " dear miss breed " joanne oppenheim could certainly slip my watch . but recently i've doubling back rereading some children books came out early 2006 . those books , one i missed early game richard peck , " here lies librarian " , courtesy dial books . mr. peck written wham-bam , rock `em , sock `em tale hard core drag racing librarianship . though still better ( anyone who reads his books regularly tell you ) than 92% schlock printed yearly , peck latest venture carries it faintest odor familiarity . basically , if you perused enjoyed his previous book , " teacher funeral " , then there probably little reason go this title well unless you like regularly douse yourself peck pleasant wordplay . quite while now it just peewee jake , jake peewee . two siblings inseparable since death their parents together they've managed cobble living themselves out small automobile body shop . year 1914 small town indiana peewee jake anxious new paved road pass their miniscule business venture . while they wait , jake working like madman create his very own automobile so enter it one county drag races . then four librarians sweep into town everything goes goofy . you see , these aren't just any old librarians . led irresistible irene ridpath , these woman shake this sleepy little village upside down , managing way help jake his dream , aid peewee ( real name eleanor ) live life she deserves , defeat maniacal dealings no good rotten kirby brothers . hilarity ensues . actually , i'll level you here . lot librarians warning me off this book , if its less-than-perfect status relegated it lowest basement dankest library . it happens , i enjoyed it quite lot . how could i not ? you've got corpses dangling trees , independently wealthy librarians , mention pierce arrow ( car i've loved since i read " cheaper dozen " lo these many years ago ) , chills , thrills , spills , gal winning drag race backwards . peck writing just great . who else comes up descriptions like , " my flesh felt like moss bait " ?. or one less than fully intelligent villains , " his knuckles dragged ground thoughtfully " ? or oblique reference vulgarity peewee saying nasty group people , " more horses laughing . or parts horses " ? wink wink . peck comfortable his time periods , whatsoever those time periods may . that part difficulty comes reading his books . loathe include glossary terms back ( which , fair , i don't think single child reader ever consulted day their life ) he kind expects you know what " step-ins " , " clabber " , or " truss " might , amongst other archaic words phrases . yeah . so pandering your library base may not crime any sort ( " i wondered if there wasn't library science course scheming " ) but it always makes me just touch suspicious . i think " here lies librarian " quite lot fun , but i'm not entirely certain how many kids would actively seek it out . i guess just remains seen . any case , it definitely fun read . not peck strongest work , certainly , but great book get you through day . if you just happen mlis degree your own then it feels just much more familiar .	1

this book written engaging fashion younger readers , so that why i gave it 2 stars . but i found attitudes conveyed towards slavery , native americans , democrats unsettling . i think there some political motives behind this book . i think author trying indoctrinate youngsters into ultra-conservative southern republican political ideas , brand christianity makes people outside church ( you know , other people god loves ) think christ-followers hateful crazy . example , p36 it states , " although it true native americans often treated badly european settlers , they treated one worse " " we cannot feel so much pity native americans when we think all this . " they it coming ? they faught killed each other like every other group humans planet , so we shouldn't feel bad injustices perpetrated white european settlers natives never recovered ? two pages deal slavery , it mentioned slave trade profitable traders , but " hard slaves " who shipped colonies " under difficult conditions . " bit understatement . , subject civil war , " many people south not own slaves , but they knew how quickly southern economy standard living would damaged if northern politicians forced southern farmers immediately free their slaves . " yikes , what slaves ' standard living ? no where it mentioned or even alluded slavery us bad wrong . it not okay own human treat him or her like animal ( or worse ) . reason north abolished slavery ? they machines work slaves , so slaves became obsolete . i quote , " ... why slavery away northern states . reason primarily northern businessmen not need slave labor operate their stores factories because they made much greater use new machines cut down amount hand labor necessary complete job . " no mention how compassionate christians ( others ) vehemently opposed way slave owners viewed , kept treated their slaves , or what they abolish slavery . finally , treatment democrats republicans really unbalanced . only things mentioned carter ? how horrible he establishing relations china , he messed up panama canal , his debaucling iran hostage situation . " short , our country sunk new lows during carter years . " clinton claims fame creating huge government against constitution people ( who promptly reelected him ) , meddling bosnia other war-torn nations , promoting homosexuality , monica lewinsky . ( why these last two issues book 9-year-olds ? ) contrast , repubs get only positive press this text . finally , book also says p178 , " sadly , our country supreme court ruled 1962 it illegal children pray public schools . " that not true . law pertains adult-led corporate prayer , but nothing prevent child praying school . if this book line your political views , then you might want buy it . but i hard time believing anyone this day age thinks slavery really not such bad thing . reason , no one should it . this text could supplemented something more truthful regarding slavery , like parent-censored version " slave narratives , " which records hundreds interviews former slaves their lives slaves after emancipation .	1

this one awesome . i followed series inspector banks books dry season onward this one probably best so far . part reason protagonist , alan banks got fixed pretty good previous book -playing fire . this story starts him still recovering all psychological physical wounds he incurred previously . you follow his struggles through his attempt coming back place where he normal again , well rebuilding his home well his relationships his co-workers , especially annie cabbot . story then forces him re-establish or re-evaluate his relationsip his younger brother , evidence their relationship hinted throughout previous books , but this book places relationship front center . robinson once again uses his signature plot device : dual story intertwining twin narratives . whereas previously robinson used this device tell two stories which related philosophical sense , this time two murders intimately related inextricably become same investigation . robinson builds plot line tempo narrative brilliantly . this time , he little more guarded his storyline so he doesn't telegraph ending much he playing fire , which makes much more satisfying ending . this particular my personal favorite out series so far just because it involves so many emotional changes characters story line so personal banks . robinson also started flesh out other detectives eastvale , giving them points views , foiles , strengths weaknesses . it makes me care lot more story it also makes story much more complicated real	1

i rely heavily amazon reader reviews plan my reading list , but i'm going respectfully disagree this . here what i think happened : judy goldstein read " devil wears prada " " nanny diaries " said " hey kids ! let re-write these books but pediatrician point view " then she thought every funny case she ever seen exaggerated it , changed names . then she thought some ridiculous plot allowed her show off her extensive knowledge fancy boutiques hamptons . now i nothing against good chick-lit , but there nothing this book . heroine * so * perfect , i found her unbelievable . actually goldstein seemed afraid include any characters weren't basically amiable ( ira goes gambling sponsored coke binges ? how eccentric ! ) even bird quirky . there so many random threads this book : receptionist chemo loses her hair , well obviously then she going focus all her attention her opera kids cd , never mention cancer again . someone suggests shelley loses few pounds poof ! she goes diet she loses 30 pounds . oh fran templar party ? let run around looking her then drop it all sudden because we remember she not actually character this book . usually i'll give any book 100 pages , if i don't like it , i'll put it down guilt-free . however i felt compelled finish 24 karat kids simply so i could write this review . i'm not going ruin highly predictable ending but it seemed me like author looked book , said " ooh look 200 pages , i'm now ! " typed final 3 page chapter tied everything up	-1
this book suggested me professor ( preston allen , author fine novel hoochie mama ) , whose opinion i respect very much ; thus , i continued reading even when i felt overwhelmed emotion ultimately rewarded story really two stories . mr. banks perhaps finest writer i ever read , his prose refined point almost too self-conscious . he master making reader feel his characters . so i followed main character northeast miami , he fled his boring life found himself more trouble than he knew possible . first story , surface story , works because rich writing some semblance plot . haitian american , i serious problem second main story ( especially because banks ' fine style ) , claude vanise story . i wept . it fiction , but i wept . i remembered how i came here small boy . i remembered what happened my mother , but i won't go into . i angry because mr. banks not haitian . i kept waiting him get it wrong -- there some stereotypical things , but they minor . this story i kept wishing someone would write . both haitians cubans see miami haven poverty political oppression their countries , but america usually sees only cubans deserving refuge . i am still bit bothered banks not haitian , but selfish reasons i wish every american would read this book . i number it among my favorites all time	1
i've enjoyed inspector banks series past ( particularly " final account " which great twist last few pages ) , but " innocent graves " all talk very little pay-off . banks himself continues interesting character , robinson writing never less than superb , but this particular mystery big " who cares ? " me . mystery itself isn't really much mystery its solution more blind luck piece evidence just happens appear , like deus ex machina last moment , than it any brilliant deduction banks part . " innocent graves " seems far more interested psychology suspects ( one particular , whose story concludes all too predictable fashion ) than satisfying its readers great solution crime . i've always found this kind mystery bit bore ; give me couple corpses some brilliant twists i'm happy . there couple corpses here , but no twist ; just far too unbelievable uninteresting ending	1
originally published " buddhism tibet , or lamaism " 1885 ( w.h. allen co ., ltd ., london ) , this classic , somewhat controversial , book gone through several title changes , including very accurate " tibetan buddhism : its mystic cults , symbolism mythology , " when reprinted dover publications 1972 ( currently print , , handsomely produced volume very reasonable price , my personal choice . ) kessinger edition , reviewed here , follows one reprintings under original title . it its time landmark english-language writings tibet , it still retains some value its rich visual documentation , form photographs line drawings . ( unfortunately , kessinger editions not well-known such contents ; reports suggest individual copies their editions differ quality . ) there some remarkably clear descriptions shrines temples , costumes ritual practices , objects images . given massive destruction tibetan religious sites china well tibet , much what he recorded never seen again . unfortunately , author all too frequently confides reader his distaste religion he describing , his contempt its functionaries . i gave up book this reason when i first tried read it . some amazon reviewers ( responding other editions ) seem think waddell must known what he talking , accept his characterizations face value , which pity . part this attitude may self-defense . it seems waddell got access some his information becoming owner/patron tibetan buddhist temple peking , probably felt he make clear his pious readers back home england he not really wicked idolater . some his expressions disdain seem reflect real misunderstandings : failed grasp word " lama " means " teacher religion , " not " monk , " he scandalized discover occasional married lama . ( this response probably relates intra-christian issues well -- see below . ) then , too , there idealized image theraveda buddhism ceylon , which introduced itself europeans true , pure , original , non-superstitious buddhism , not confused those self-styled buddhisms found elsewhere . vision standard purity , versions found northern asia would automatically seem defective , waddell takes it granted . ( it should remembered mahayana , or " great vehicle , " versions buddhism , like tibet , tend refer theraveda teachings hinayana , or " lesser vehicle . " ) finally , waddell , apparently writing solidly " anti-papist " readership , sometimes seems unable distinguish images rituals mahayana buddhism , its various forms , parallel practices catholicism , glad condemn both . worth reading today ? well , book still cited , diffidence , scholars far more sympathetic subject , far better informed it , its extraordinary amount factual documentation . novice tibetan studies , i would suggest starting solid introduction , like snellgrove richardson " cultural history tibet , " those looking further information might continue responsible modern study , such giuseppe tucci " religions tibet . " you could probably turn waddell details after reading either one . those interested " sampler , " i point out waddell published 1894 similar , but much , much shorter , volume ( under 200 pages ) sikkim , " lamaism sikhim " ( his spelling ) . this long out print , but adobe reader pdf book made available set free downloads , due warning waddell biases , part bibliography section " himalayan art resources " himalayanart.org . it might helpful check out " waddell lite " before deciding bigger book . whole bibliography there may helpful , too	1

it interesting note this not very good book . after considering novel premise , one would think it would prove entertaining any mercedes lackey books . lackey , author who developed exacting balance necessary romantic fantasy , writes here her new five hundred kingdoms universe , which , fairy godmother , so sly , ironic engaging . encouragement seemed cemented quick skim through first few pages , which established characters her sophomoric effort those reliable archetypes lackey perfected . princess andromeda acadia , kind generous heart shines through her shy , bookish exterior ; perfectly flawed heroine . andromeda antagonists her mother , queen cassiopeia , queen adviser , both whom demonstrate lewd ambition most lackey most effective villains . they plot cheat princess andromeda her rightful place ( one reminded , often , lackey subtler black swan ) , andromeda finds herself allied unlikely champion surprising love interest , summons within her strength fight back against traitors crown . this brief synopsis , reader determine there nothing groundbreaking one good knight . not necessarily fault . but what one slowly comes understand this , latest variation lackey perfected formula , its utter lack charm . lackey seemed unable find herself slightest enthusiasm any her favorite constructions . her villains laid manipulative traps heroine , only them forgotten shortly after . reasoning behind most characters ' actions never developed . aimless descriptions dragged her heroes drifted together , seemingly without real motivation . time romantic thread story clumsily resolved , one could only stare , wide-eyed , what could only most falsely bland conclusion lackey ( or any author outside romance shelves ) ever wrought . how could any author genuinely enjoy her characters still lump them together so indifferently ? passionless union two couples , not mention utter confusion " climactic " battle , leaves reader perplexed . his confusion not aided what may most mediocre final line ever span paperback page . there no argument : this book neither original nor well-written . only place where opinions may disagree whether this novel misstep , not growing trend , mercedes lackey prolific career	1

i no comments this particular translation republic , it only version i read . republic not live up its namesake . " socrates " says ( i think we all know socrates really just plato play dough after book 1 ) close book 9 , vision kallipolis only " exists theory " or perhaps there " model it heaven . " earlier differentiation theory practice make it clear plato only intended use kallipolis model human soul . therefore , suggested policies eugenics , infanticide , communal property , holding women children " common " probably not taken seriously . plato himself predicts inevitable unraveling such city . after reading republic second time , it occurred me it little more than self-help manual . reason should rule spirit passion . " dabbling " weakens character . understand difference necessity luxury . shatter your illusions what you think you know , etc etc . not these not important , but such ideas not require complex analogy totalitarian society . thus , i think republic slightly overrated . most compelling portion this book , my opinion , critique various constitutions . while critiques oligarchy , tyranny , timocracy democracy map nicely individual soul , they also make logical sense independently . while convention led us disregard former 3 constitutions , democracy often placed pedestal most ideal form government . plato challenges this notion succeeds vigor tearing down this pedestal . democracy , even its representative form , not much more than tyranny majority . we witness democracy inherent flaws today u.s. , issues such abortion gay marriage . this , my opinion , only significant thing republic offer modern political theorist	1

owen wister " virginian , " first published 1902 , considered many exemplify american western novel . wister certainly established code west , stereotypical figures tough but genteel courageous cowboy , ( one wearing white hat riding white horse ) , spinster schoolmarm back east , horse rustlers , corrupt villain beyond redemption . fact , novel contains scene constituting first known " shootout " american literature . our narrator easterner , man who visits judge henry , virginian employer , his ranch sunk creek fairly frequently . i came think him mr. wister himself , who travel wyoming parts west extensively . my perspective , virginian , whose true name never revealed , anything but stereotype , although many heroes modeled after him . yes , he tall , dark handsome . this description not terribly distinctive or unusual . one could definitely call him strong silent type , he marked sense honor , loyalty justice . however , born raised virginia before civil war , it realistic assume he instilled values southern gentleman . although he not manor born , his family decent hardworking , one certainly not need wealth live good book . war veteran longtime wanderer throughout western territories , he learned survival skills his mid-twenties . loose lips not desirable trait if one wanted live long healthy life . i found virginian credible character , flawed like all men , but clear unwavering sense right wrong . he man suited his environment his times , personifies rugged individual . it important note period which this novel written fully enjoy it , just it crucial understand times setting which such authors charles dickens , jane austen george eliot wrote . " virginian , " wister states : " it through declaration independence we americans acknowledged eternal equality man . it we abolished cut-and-dried aristocracy . we seen little men artificially held up high places , great men artificially held down low places , our own justice-loving hearts abhorred this violence human nature . therefore , we decreed every man should henceforth equal liberty find his own level . this very decree we acknowledged gave freedom true aristocracy , saying , ' let best man win , whoever he . ' america word . true democracy . " believing this so strongly , it any wonder character virginian created ? miss mary stark wood bennington , vermont , who calls herself spinster age 20 , she woman ahead her time . many created mary image , but she original . intelligent , independent , adventurous , full pluck , yes , pretty , she sets off teach school bear creek , wyoming , get away family pressure wed unwanted suitor , probably see more world . acquaintance correspondent miss wood , mrs. balaam , bear creek resident , wrote told young woman teaching position . mary accepts , it happens , virginian first meet her upon her arrival . he actually rescues her , primitive stagecoach she traveling mired-down creek - driver drunk quite irresponsible . she later embarrassed , remembering how tightly she clung cowboy , fright , not out flirtatiousness . he , however , cannot get her out his mind . this so much more than romance novel , although there romance aplenty , both classical nature kind man courting woman . virginian bete noir evil character named trampas . two clash throughout tale until final showdown . one books classic lines our hero responding trampas after nasty insult , " when you call me , smile . " he also betrayed trusted friend who becomes corrupt out greed weakness . law order not arrived wyoming territory it up individuals maintain civil society . mary wood calls this taking law into one own hands , or vigilantism . this issue becomes bone contention herself virginian . owen wister imbues his characters , especially virginian mary , remarkable sense depth . their relationship , well his relationship his old friend steve , depicted particular poignancy . initial reserve mary her suitor normal period . however , sexual tension them palpable . graphic love scenes not necessary here . author more kiss embrace than many modern writers accomplish all their erotica . there some terrific humor also . i found emily , hen , one most original animals fiction absolutely hilarious . wister vivid passages describing wyoming wilderness extraordinary , making it easy one visualize gorgeous landscapes . pace somewhat slow times . however , i not find narrative all tedious . time passed more slowly back then things took longer accomplish obvious reasons . this difference demonstrated way tale told . " virginian " voted western american writers 1977 greatest western novel all time . whether it or isn't debatable , but i really enjoyed it . this 100th anniversary edition max evans contributes new fascinating afterwards . highly recommend . jan	1

i'll start admitting i not read complete , unabridged , six-volume set winston churchill " second world war " . i read condensed version , which still mighty tome , twelve hundred pages small print . book fascinating many respects churchill certainly unique powerful prose stylist . you can't help but struck his phrase-making . where others might say " .. it great impoortance .. etc . " , churchill gives us immeasurably better " .. it highest consequence ... etc . " there no doubt churchill singular personality , but one reads into his account wwii , one can't help but wonder whether it true man never suffered moment self doubt , never wondered whether he making right decision ? churchill writings once criticized " triumph public over personal " it must said there some weight . only glimpses one regularly given into churchill mind his expressions frustration alarm when people disagree him prefer not take what him obviously correct path . before entry us into war , he only frustrated disagreements his military commanders he could fire them , e.g. wavell auchinleck ( churchill only really admired attacking generals it clear caution not one attributes he particularly admired ) . after us entered war churchill obliged cede considerable amount control americans , he frequently overruled his views how war should prosecuted seems , each instance remained convinced rest his life he right it terrible shame he didn't get his way . he never admits wrong anything makes one question fairness his accoun t.t he other remarkable thing this history complete omission any reference concentration camps or hitler " final solution " . friend churchill buff suggested me this because churchill embarassed not known anything camps until nearly end war but cannot correct . what strange thing leave out what intended definitive history ! all all , these great books required reading anyone who wants thorough knowledge wwii , but they seem me written man unable keep his eye off his own place history , however much he may wanted write straight factual account one defining events twentieth century .	1

first word rule st. benedict ' listen ' . this rule , composed centuries ago benedict community , continued communities across world this day , powerful way living into fullness god grace love . however , title this text esther de waal indicates , it not always easy rule , nor one immediately grasped completely understood . monastics oblates benedict orders take vows , typically poverty , obedience , chastity conversion life ( oblate vows modified reflect reality living outside enclosed monastic community , but vows derivative same root ) . it last vow , conversion life , perhaps heart this book . conversion this context not once-for-all , ' road damascus ' kind experience , but rather daily decision continue working toward new kind life . de waal first chapter deals healing - we live broken lives broken world , not just physical well-being sense . using images biblical texts such garden eden cross , prayers st. anselm text st. benedict , she weaves ideas healing , wholeness , fullness even we recognise our short-comings brokenness . god accepts us who we each point , but calls us perfection we never really attain . if this seems like paradox , you're something . next chapter entitled ' power paradox ' . monastic movement always its heart paradoxical call individual ( latin root word monastic mono , meaning ' one ' or ' singular ' ) context community . christian call world but not world , resist world yet work within world , such paradox . de waal illuminates several such paradoxes , including primary christian paradox cross , both image death life , defeat victory . ' paradox ' sometimes considered fancy word contradiction . benedict rule seems full contradiction , just life seems many times . benedict looks today primary focus activity energy , but also looks forward future most important . benedict requires life service others practice hospitality , but also emphasises need solitude withdraw world . de waal explores through rule benedict what it means live oneself , living others community , living world , both together apart . each person endowed gifts graces , potential us see christ them , if we attentive (' listen ' ) lose ourselves we might also christ-like sake others . contradictions de waal highlights include difference desert marketplace ( early desert fathers never quite removed world they might wanted ; marketplace not ' unholy ' or ' ungodly ' place necessarily , st. paul often his teaching while plying his trade tent-maker marketplace ) . whichever avenue taken , desert or marketplace , de waal emphasises necessity prayer anchor - de waal uses example thomas merton , man solitary prayer also completely involved world large . saying ' yes ' call benedict , live spiritual life , live life tensions contradictions , never simple intellectual assent , but rather one come complete person , body soul . it recognising paschal mystery both folly wisdom , recognising ourselves always repeat yes . according de waal , echoing idea conversion life ongoing task , one must say ' yes ' every day , repeating the'yes ' asking blessing each night , passing task oneself others constant basis . de waal reflections not simple easy . small-format book , if one reading words alone , text could completed matter hour or two , but this would lose richness benedict ( de waal ) insights images . this book longer-term meditation , read lectio divina , read inspirational guidance , taken small pieces like rich chocolates , savoured appreciated slowly full experience .	1

after bought first edition read numerous other finance strategy texts ( addition graduated mba finance ) , i think it fair say this grinblatt book rather superficial its coverage technical matters e.g. options , financial engineering etc . poor its treatment real life contemporary issues e.g. , bankruptcy etc . plus i still can't see what it got corporate strategy . something still missing here .... most write-up kind basic ( i.e nothing oustanding ) explanation issues , concepts or techniques finance , which you easily find other texts much simpler names . title this book catchy but misleading . priced $120 , this really rip-off . i just don't understand how other commentors could give 5-star this " shoddy " piece work . reference manual corporate boardrooms wall street ? come ! you guys must joking ! no offence but this what they'd call " cutting edge " ? compared classics like copeland " financial theory corporate policy " or slightly less-advanced brigham " intermediate financial management " , this grinblatt book really falls short standard needs lot catching up . hopefully , authors take serious note this their upcoming edition . unless course , they still want their book just " appetizer " business undergraduates .... short , not worth buying . never judge book its cover or this case its rather appealing title	-1

licensed private pilot i often dreamed doing just what author , i.e. rent vintage airplane , take whole summer off fly around entire united states . so , when i saw this book i bought it immediately settled vicarious thrill . unfortunaely , author describes almost no contact local people only passing mention scenery he flies over . his mission apperars simply touch down every state then fly next airport ; mission accomplished . he lands , goes nearby restuarant , hamburger ( quot ; it goodquot ;) flies . there many writers out there who traveled usa motorcycle , car or boat ( see william heat-moon quot ; river horsequot ;) managed write fascinating account their adventures . this book very cut dry left me wanting more . maybe someone take same trip some summer write book worth reading	1
