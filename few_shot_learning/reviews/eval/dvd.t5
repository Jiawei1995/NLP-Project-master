**** this comment may contain spoilers ! ***anyone who saw this growing up soft spot their hearts it ; i've encountered enough people over course my 37 yrs who perk up mention it aware its place lot our memories . this satirized simpsons , which proves it embedded itself national pop culture consciousness . anyone who read book its based , incredible " i am legend " richard matheson , knows this film very little common it beyond its intial premise -- even not followed too closely . all criticisms omega man valid : it very dated not all scary or intense some stunts special effects laughably , ludicrously cheesy ; villains -- who should more terrifying than even romero zombies -- just crazed albino hippie luddites last half film , once chuck hooks up rosalind cash kiddies , really let down . but scenes open film heston hefting cool-looking machine gun while decked out austin powers-style finery (!) staring angst old calendar or losing his mind moment hallucinating sound telephones ringing deserted city still pack punch . this second movie , after 1959 world , flesh , devil , successfully pull off eerie effect last living human huge empty city . both films established visual motif streets filled blowing waves newspapers swirling trash . after years seeing this tv -- guaranteed late september or early october event every year few years local tv station during my pacific northwest childhood old dark ages before cable tv videocassette revolution , its nice see this movie dvd beautiful widescreen transfer . it looks sounds great . child i always liked music , particularly " surprise party " theme plays when villains make thir first appearance . it rocks here all its xylophone funky electric organ horns glory	1
my wife i , huge fans `america next top model ' `project runway ' , very excited seeing this film . why it took us this long still baffles me , but friday night we pleasure seeing `the devil wears prada ' let me just say it quite pleasure . now , most if not all praise heaped shoulders meryl streep , while she outstanding , this film more than just meryl painted canvas . there four brilliant performances this film they all deserving praise . first anne hathaway who plays andrea sachs , young aspiring journalist who takes job working miranda priestly assistant `runway magazine ' . anne hathaway proves her performance she all grown up . no , that not take away her more adult roles more adult films like `havoc ' masterpiece `brokeback mountain ' , but here anne proves she adult comedy , not falling back into her teen goofiness made her famous `the princess diaries ' but keeping everything smart mature . she enough poise grace match wits miranda , she so elegantly . next up emily blunt who plays emily , miranda first assistant ( there two , andrea second ) . emily worked her butt off get where she , slaving unruly priestly it all pay off trip alongside miranda paris . only thing standing her way andrea , if andrea fails miserably then it reflects poorly emily . emily blunt turns out i think best performance bunch she enough sass , enough attitude enough wit make her pop out screen stand out no matter who sharing screen her . stanley tucci also wonderfully here nigel , miranda second command . he there make sure everything perfect , also help andrea adjust . stanley always great backup work , playing second hand man just everyone , but here he really makes his performance his own owns it . he delivers some funniest lines film but he never feels like `token gay guy ' ... he needed this film , not filler , he commands his scenes really stands out amidst crowd . then , course , we meryl streep who plays ruthless tyrant known miranda priestly . what i most impressed way meryl underplays every word , every emotion , every scene , which not what i expected . i really expected her go all glen close reincarnate cruella but she didn't ( thankfully ) instead turned out one most inspired performances year . she must fun playing snooty self absorbed above all selfish editor-in-chief `runway ' . she lets us see inside her character briefly ( when crying over failed marriage ) but her character more shutting off feeling order succeed so we don't get see real miranda because we're not supposed . carried these four brilliant performances `the devil wears prada ' fabulous film make you laugh make you smile impress almost anyone . script brilliantly adapted lauren weisberger novel , while it not exact replica ( any adaptations these days ? ) it carries same wit but smoothes things out make it more approachable , my eyes , more enjoyable . bravo	1
this movie full memorable scenes , although it probably more than decade since i last saw it . it suspenseful without gory ... most memorable scene one absolutely chilling without ever showing drop blood . even though i'd read book knew outcome i edge my seat right finish	1
i utterly honest , i don't buy music cds anymore . so many bands hitting streets faster than i imagine , i honestly cannot keep up them all . music begins sound same , corporations seem their pre-determined hit prior public even forming their own opinion . those like simpsons , backstreet boys , even hip-hop artists blending together sound uniform , unoriginal , overly drab . i nearly lost my faith music , retreating some my older music like dmb , counting crows , travis , but then i found ... suns . stumbling around internet i discovered , shockingly , one videos their album called " romantic death " . it one most creative disturbing videos i seen quite some time . then it hit me , i couldn't get this song out my mind . throughout whole day i beat , lyrics , overall sensation song stuck my mind ... i only heard it once . like drug , i needed more . when i returned home evening i found song again couldn't stop listening it . first time long time , i found new band . then , i bought this album . knowing nothing band except " romantic death " song , i put this my dvd player continued impressed . their videos just smart their music . their tracks seem cover every genre music folk , rock , even hard edge . their lyrics seem well-considered , smart voice new generation . my favorites album : " must you "" romantic death " ( parental guidance suggested ) " lost home "" rockstop "" we tried " fact , every time i listen this album i find new song explore , new song jam way work ; new song enjoy ! those skeptical this band , i suggest this album test your tastes . not only it provide songs you burn onto other cds which allow friends family explore this band , but also all their energetic , original videos never see light day mtv , but watched leisure your dvd player . sun breath fresh air music industry this album finally got me out corporate rut seems plaguing this industry . " ... if rockstops , it'll all my fault ... " grade : ***** out *****	1
movie guy , who lot work no fun then feels sorry . that pretty much whole story . well , idea quite powerful but not new , characters " comics " style very primitive , jokes quite boring . actually what really amazing , it could've ok watch family movie , but few really tasteless jokes made it pg13 rated without adding any fun , so movie family values not appropriate kids . too boring adults , not appropriate kids , too much moral young crowd - i can't really think who might like it	-1
i often wonder if some if not most people writing rave reviews , 5 stars , really paid , biased , professionals pumping up movie increased dvd sales .	-1
i saw this movie years ago , but didn't remember much it , except some songs , basic story . i also saw " nights cabiria " , which story taken . i love musicals , i think shirley maclaine very talented . she very sweet charity hope valentine , one can't help wanting happy ending her . so why i think this movie awful ? first all , some dialogue so repetitious it became irritating -- how many times you listen charity say " fickle finger fate " over over without wanting hit mute button ? also , some scenes went -- especially elevator scene . -- intermission totally unnecessary . but worst disappointment me musical numbers . i didn't like any them --- they so far over top silly . bob fosse must thrown everything into them he could --- instead letting dancers songs carry numbers , he so much busyness all them -- too many people , costumes didn't fit story , silly moves -- they all went past point enjoyment . i fast forwarded thrua couple them just get them over . i never before any movie . this could so much better -- story good , charactors good -- but whole thing should toned down . movie could 30 minutes shorter if there some trimming . it entirely too long . also --- all stop action -- what all ? i know , i know -- it show progress story , but it distraction . i didn't like movie glad when it over .	-1
ok , this far most pathetic taping show ( although sweeney todd comes close second ) . where show ?! they cut out " glory " battle scene just actors come out look happy instead creepy like they should when they slow-mo battle scene ( not movie ... ) . also , where " i guess i'll miss man ? " that beautiful song cut movie why ? also what " prayer duck " many others !!! this far worst ladies gentlemen completely ruins show created stephen schwartz great bob fosse ! oh yeah , chita rivera " spread little sunshine " pathetic , players not convince me they creepy really wanted pippin " grand finale . " i this show it greatest show i've ever , but this dvd pathetic . don't waste your money costly price $19.99 , it should $7.99 because how many great songs scenes cut this show	-1
george clooney quentin tarantino got two worst actors all time . it sheer agony watch these nerds pretend macho tough guys . this whole flick akin getting gift-wrapped packagewrapped fanciest wrapping paper ... problem , often case tarantino robert rodriguez , ain't nothin ' inside package . get it ? these guys like worst movies managed become makers some worst movies ever . word shallow comes mind . there nothing there , i doubt there ever . however , said , i must give credit where credit due : juliette lewis , talented juliette lewis , terrific usual . good see harvey keitel his thing , same goes fred williamson , rarely seen michael parks ( this guy , way made some terrific country-type records back 60's--and we wish he'd more . he up there merle haggard my humble opinion ) , last but not least , beautiful salma hayek also this , although she hardly enough . she still curves back then . addition above , we could without all obvious crappy cgi effects end . stuff just doesn't work ; never . way , documentary full -tilt boogie waybetter than main feature .	-1
it obvious this movie full lies . although i not actually seen it , i know this true because i seen many discussions movie fox news channel ( god bless them ! ) . way he attacks poor mr. heston deplorable . can't michael moore tell comments charlton made rallies he doesn't his faculties him ? i am also unsure mr. heston even said things movie shows him saying . ability hollywood manipulate edit sound truly amazing , making it appear my president ( heston ) uncaring , babbling idiot simply using his own words - shame you michael ! way he got gun bank , i agree other posters entire point bank giving away free guns completely nullified fact they didn't give him gun minute he walked into bank . bravo those who figured out . also , michael moore fat . take pinkie	-1

i worked out denise austin several years because i think she gives good workout but i cannot stand her way-too-perky personality . i very disappointed this dance workout . setting fun colorful music great , but far workout ... this dvd really stinks . i found some steps somewhat confusing ( but i am not very coordinated ) . this workout more " indoor walk " style workout ( like walk away pounds w/ leslie sansone , etc . ) . if you looking fun way get up move , this may you . but , this not anyone looking cardio intense workout	-1
whoever made this film obviously trying impress upon viewer idea artists deep complex people . but all i see film low life drug addict losers who sit around ( few them seem jobs ) party all day . main character ( sid ) pseudointellectual who claims she majored critical theory college ( ultra liberal nonsense which goal undermining western culture pave pathway marxism ) . film appeals naive youth	-1
okay , i gave pretty bad review this dvd originally because it didn't play right . but after viewing it without technical problems , i would like say it pretty good program given rarity subject matter , good addition any collection . ancient muscle conditioning ? not many dvd out there subject . i've edited my original review it won't allow me give it more stars , but i'd give it 4 . sorry , mr. keen , if i cost you sales this . i commend you putting this out	-1
i couldn't watch this till end . bad production values , gimmicky , desperate make point violence voyeurism evil wanting make it evah so clevah while my neurons slowly commit suicide �nnui . if you wanna go all deep thoughts violence still get shaken - both intelectually viscerally - try something like miike " ichi killer " . makes this movie look so , so needless . leading man looked geeky occasionally cute . 2 stars eye candy	-1

they just don't movies like this anymore . this not movie makes charlie sheen or tom berenger appeal young audiences who like flashy stars sceen . this amovie show you reality war experiences happened people past . charlie sheen stars man who volutarily goes war . this seems odd he figures out why everyone looking him so weird when he telling them this later movie . he finds out alright . keith david plays his friend who tries keep his spirits up this definitely his best role . he cheers him up great scene where they get extremely baked . supporting cast this movie unbelievable no flat performances here . overall this my favorite movie all time . it stood test time never fails when i want see good movie . i just old special edition , not 20th anniversary but extras very nice . it commentary direcotor seperate one military advisor who worked film . there also lengthy doumentary making when i saw this i mroe than glad i got special edition . you would nto believe what actors went through ! it great making .	1

philip noyce very smart filmmaker . once more he confirms it through this intense intriguing psychological picture around notable expert forensic ( denzel washington ) sadly bedridden quadriplegic who joins forces witty female agent ( angelina jollie ) intend all their means get mysterious serial killer around low belly nyc . smart clues , notable shots , first rate direction , kinetic script make this movie one five most solid thrillers nineties according tradition silence lambs well underneath homage " rear window " , if you carefully establish visible connections , due if james stewart visible peeping tom those times , denzel washington scrutinizing cyber eye . paradigm remains , just form changes . highly recommended .	1
" sentinel " isn't movie i entirely expected like , although i've wanted see it since it theatres . even though plot different , it kept bringing mind movie released this year called " firewall . " even while watching this movie , i thought it similar " firewall " many ways ... but i also found myself entertained it . now presidential assassination movies almost cliche now ; but few good ones come around . my favorite movie this kind " line fire . " it entertaining , well acted , made sense , great film . sentinel good performances , it entertaining , but it doesn't always make sense . it never really explained why people this film want kill president . even if they just want it it , they could've told us . inside man told us bankrobbers just wanted it beginning . anyway , oscar winner michael douglas ( best actor , ' wall street ' ) plays pete garrison , secret service agent who once took bullet ronald reagan . years later , pete affair first lady ( kim basinger ) odds his former best friend david breckinridge ( marvelous kiefer sutherland ) , also secret service agent . see david under impression pete affair his wife . anyway , through rat , pete discovers there mole secret service who helping terrorists plot kill president . same time , pete getting anonymously blackmailed his affair first lady , result , evidence piling up fact pete maybe mole . now entire secret service after him , including david his new partner jill ( eva longoria , who got some good acting chops away wisteria lane ) . this movie its share cliches . there few times where i watching this movie thinking myself " sounds/looks familiar . " i saw end coming mile away . but , ending quickly redeems itself ( my point-of-view anyway ) relationship pete first lady not going direction you'd think . lot people won't like this film reasons i've mentioned more ... but if you want some semi-mindless entertainment ( although this movie its smart characteristics blending its flaws ) , then sentinel actually pretty good way pass time . due its flaws , only fact i enjoyed it support my case , i should give it 4 stars ... but i think it worthy enough 5 . entertainment goes long way . grade :	1
well , finally we've reached end " yellow brick road " ourselves great dvd release this awesome concert out oz , nov 1993 . i love how this band still gives fans what they want ( check : need lol ) release great great great dvd their live shows ! i mean , i am prince fan also ( not much i i 14)and guy barely let out any his spectacular concert shows ! ( " syracuse ' 85 " , " sign o ' times " , " rave 2000 " , now " alladin live " --- that it ?? ) out vhs or dvd . " alladin " " rave " only dvd releases , well officially anyways . u2 could would put out live anthology boxed set - 1979-2006 if they wanted it would not culled any their already released live dvd/vhs releases(ie " zoomerang sydney " , " popmart mexico city " etc)i mean mind boggles possibilities ! but what come out quality quantity ! i mean they put out fabulous " chicago 2005 " show last year ( same year it recorded -in may ! ) there talk " vertigo tour " dvd ( forgot what show -i wanna say mexico city ) this year too ! i mean we u2 fans it too damn good ! i know forthcoming " popmart " dvd release due probably next year . like this dvd they put out great transfer fun bonus material really capture " era " it represented . " zoo tv " " popmart " both my two favorite tours , even though i never got myself u2 concert until november 2001 transcendent experience ! same " vertigo nov 2005 " , but show not high standard left big stadium tours . these guys still deliver . wait patient " red rocks 1983 " too it come out soon i think ! when it , expect same love care given out men u2 !!!	1
beatles accomplished so much - good music , good recording capturing their magic , good transferring their personalities appeal onto film . help ! meant fun it some slapstick elements mostly due ringo abilities straight man . he always most honest one he holds film together . if anyone feels he didn't much others , then this film evidence contrary . beatles ' humour style incorporates elements goons peter sellers , who friend theirs . enjoy this silly film marvel best songs it .	-1
i grabbed this flick shelf very wet miserable day my local target .... craving summer sun needing island vacation .... cover appealled me these reasons i admit i not all disappointed movie . scenery indeed spectacular . underwater diving/snorkling scenes clear , crisp , just what doctor ordered . even sharks rays made it all quite beautiful . ok , enough shallow stuff .... movie indeed much like 70 flick " deep " which i enjoyed back then well . characters jared sam pretty believable - poor , honest , happy folks ( most us would love really this happy - let face it ! ) introduction bryce ( played scott caan ) really created interesting balance characters how each reacted many dangers , twists , etc . overall , bikinis buff guys added adventure many us would love our generally boring lives . would i want deal tiger sharks ? no , but little excitement would beat heck out my boring 9-5 job every day .	-1

i just kid when this show ... i loved every episode it . back then , it looked sleek , chic , exciting , everything you could ask tv show ... just like charlie angels ... or vega$ ... i remember them all ... almost 30 years later , it looks so dated ... so different today fast paced , violent , end-twisting , loud , in-your-face tv . still we love it . stories so simple ... wagner powers so much charm ... so much style . let me add today i guess i still secretly dream 1978 mercedes-benz yellow wagon big telephone ( laughs ) . it used so super cool !!! wathing those episodes made me feel again like 6 year-old kid just introduced late 70 television - jokes , kitchens , hairdos , telephones , vcrs , big cars , disco ... oh , i loved mark snow theme . i recognized it instantly ... max introduction mr. mrs. ... whose hobby murder !!! you want know what dreams middle class ' during late 70 ? watch hart hart . everything great . everything ideal ! what great show ! thanks memory . ps ... someday , someone write history american society through 20th century tv shows ' point view . i'm sure hart hart , charlie angels , moonlighting , magnum pi ( many many others)will all lot say . classic !!!!!	1
nick devlin ( lee marvin ) , enforcer chicago mob , sent kansas city collect debt rancher meat packer named mary ann ( gene hackman ) . mary ann sent mob run things down there now claims fiefdom his own . previous enforcers dealt way appropriate mary ann chosen industry . nick takes his trusted driver three mob goons him collect money . upon their arrival , they find mary ann presiding over livestock auction , but livestock this auction meat packer second source income , prostitution . nick rescues poppy ( sissy spacek ) , drugged out young woman , they leave . neither nick or mary ann give other , leaving only one conclusion . " prime cut " directed michael ritchie , made 1972 , new film me . recently , ebert roeper featured number lee marvin films new dvd . i never fan marvin , but films looked intriguing so i gave few try also revisited " professionals " , one my favorite films starring burt lancaster lee marvin . it important remember film made 1972 because it strikes viewer dated . shortly after nick rescues poppy , he buys her dress ( she naked livestock auction ) they go dinner fancy restaurant his hotel . poppy new dress little hide her breasts , but she seems blissfully unaware older men women restaurant stare her . all time , nick poppy ignore them , trying conversation . everything this scene screams early 70s me , their conversation `subtle ' look class . later film , nick his goons arrange meet mary ann local county fair collect money . this sequence introduced series close ups man walking stilts , children laughing , etc ., all meant disorient viewer before letting them become familiar new setting . again , very 70s . there many sequences film which strange , unusual interesting , ultimately making film worth watching . opening sequence ; mary ann demented brother , weenie ( gregory walcott ) gets rid one mob enforcers ( perhaps most memorable scene ) , harvesting machine chasing nick poppy through corn field , ritchie seems paying homage hitchcock it works . action scenes interesting hold your attention . even scene set corn field , which close enough called rip off famous chase hitchcock " north northwest " ; ritchie adds little touch end make it memorable interesting . you won't able stop watching it . when story turns more sedate matters everything relies actors , film less successful . marvin seems most comfortable portraying mobsters , generals cowboys throughout his career . his demeanor well-suited these types roles . he merely stare most men they surrender . this persona works well this character . but when nick supposed human , it doesn't work . when nick takes poppy dinner , it isn't clear if nick trying romance poppy or become her supportive " uncle " . she clearly seems flirting him but nick doesn't seem return favor . thankfully . this point marvin 47 ( wow , he looks older . but i guess he always . ) spacek 22 . not very age appropriate . this scene works if poppy flirting nick ; he just saved her life prostitution her life pretty screwed up point . but it would creepy watch marvin nick putting moves younger actress . gene hackman always interesting watch . villain name mary ann going fairly menacing . hackman follows occasional outbursts quick smile or joke , trying hide his true menace . this performance reminded me exactly lex luthor makes this character seem all more like dry run villain he would play " superman " films beginning 1978 . sissy spacek good , her first starring role , but part very traditional take female sidekick so prevalent action films . great performance , check out her later work " bedroom " . " prime cut " memorable exercise action filmmaking . two sequences film stay me long time . you figure out which ones ?	-1
how you twist turn most obnoxious individual completely disgusting job into hero ? black magic . after some time you begin wish him well feel tempted light up . this lovely satire political correctness , lobbyism , corruption draws you into unbearable lightness smooth talking . if you argue correctly , you not wrong , right ? eckhart perfect main part ; there many nice smaller parts , but my favorite little boy playing hero son . boy deserves nomination best supporting actor . actually he looks like scarlet little brother sometimes . they related	1
i read book then re-read book . i saw movie not once but twice . it somewhat different book . i like pollock lot , his movies so interesting me i could'nt wait movie come out . acting well only one flaw . casting tom cruise this otherwise well developed movie . everyone else great job acting here . me though , tom miscasted . he seems out place . his thinking good his intentions what character suppose but he just did'nt click what sidney wanted character . sorry cruise fans he wasted far i am concerned . gene hackman , well ed harris they well . great movie but could better without cruise here	-1
i read book before i saw movie . i am committed , devout catholic christian also , but i never read book or saw movie anything more than exciting fiction ... i think all bashing alarmismfrom religious right " overblown media many christian community who gladly mined book movie themselves profits ...

i am diehard aitf fan since it first aired so i don't care extras or digital remasterings . what shown dvd includes footage hasn't aired thirty years because it trimmed out so they could show more commercials syndicated reruns . this series seminal piece television history . current political climate hypersensitivity political correctness series like this could never produced it sad commentary how low american culture declined . i don't know what holding up dvd releases but i would snap up entire series plus abp boxed set second i wish how they would just release this series	-1

" brother brother " packs lot ambition into its compact running time . director rodney evans interwoven modern-day story perry , young gay african-american artist ( anthony mackie ) living new york , struggling find love sense identity , nothing less than brief film history birth harlem renaissance literary movement , its seminal figures langston hughes , wallace thurman , zora neale hurston bruce nugent shown black-and-white flashbacks . aged , destitute but still witty unbowed nugent ( roger robinson ) befriends perry present becomes his touchstone . " brother brother " perhaps its best flashbacks , which vividly capture excitement sense limitless possibility briefly existed nugent his compatriots they founded radical literary journal " fire ! " they make one want know more these people . present-day narrative its virtues well , shedding light special problems gay african-americans well struggle maintain one artistic identity integrity . frankness which male/male sex treated , without prurience or heavy guilt , most welcome . curiously , reviewer mentioned , however , couplings shown almost exclusively involve black white men , which undercuts film contention black gay men should celebrate their uniqueness . moreover , evans ' protagonist too many issues contend -- homophobic parents classmates , trying make living painter , boyfriend troubles -- everything fit comfortably within short allotted time . finally , it must said actor greater emotional range than mackie may able bring out more facets perry , who too often seems merely handsome , glum cipher . still , despite its flaws , " brother brother " succeeds illuminating corners human experience long neglected mainstream filmmaking , this certainly merits praise	-1
i purchased this vhs back 1994 when it first came out . i loved it back then just much i now . it fast workout if daily give you results . background music workout clothes little cheesy but movements get job . even my 14 year old son enjoys working out me . i lost 6 inches off my waist doing 8 minute abs portion !! if you want quick but effective workout , buy this dvd	1
this interesting informative dvd gain broader view how media operates , especially during runup iraq war . however , it so jam-packed information it occasionally seems gloss over important points or scenarios . there some segments i would liked schechter elaborated few which could presented more clearly . member younger generation this dvd great because it provides informed picture just how much media bed government . me , it tied lot loose ends together my head gave me broader view how mass media functions . i disagree reviewer schechter movie too much . he narrating his own point view he stayed out way when it appropriate .	-1

i love jeff goldblum , but he didn't carry this film . film ruined me second julane moore ( yuck ! ) ridiculous , lame token black daughter goldblum showed up no doubt satisfy nauseating political correctness hollywood all expense this bust film . it obviously too much ask white protagonist actually white daughter . what concept . it just added disbelief characters ( stay goldblum ) , storyline , ultimate letdown this much anticipated sequel . jurassic park iii wasn't much better	-1
movie aside , this dvd set great . there two versions this film choose this dvd ; original , directors cut . i loved new version added scenes ( even though they aren't significant plot it nice able watch them ) . additional bonus features extensive , rodriguez cooking class also quite fun . movie ... it sheer genius . i don't always love rodriguez work but when he gets it right it doesn't get much better . this movie my favorite film 2005 . fact frank miller co-director shines through results . this movie follows original graphic novels ( which i would also highly recommend ) scene scene . it like graphic novel came life . use black white , mixed flashes color makes this one most visually innovative films i ever seen . fact it not even mentioned academy ( technical merit if nothing else ) inexcusable . major strength this film like other successful adaptations ( i.e. lord rings ) source material first rate . when basis film good frank miller graphic novels it makes it hard go wrong - when miller himself helps direct it makes it almost sure thing . not gush , but i think no major flaws this film - acting , directing , cinematography , script , plot ... everything perfect . if you haven't seen this film , or read original graphic novels , yourself favor check this out .	1

just any movie featuring howard keel likely among very best late mgm musicals , this version oft-adapted broadway classic shows you why . he plays gaylord ravenal , " tennessee ravenals , " river gambler dandy who loses his steamboat ticket game wanders down riverside try con his way aboard cap'n andy hawks ( joe . brown ) showboat " cotton blossom .

" besides gorgeous music -- which itself reason enough own rewatch this movie ( i always sing my two favorite pieces , " ol ' man river " " you love , " even though i keep adjusting my pitch ! ) -- lavish production values make it superior example last glory days greatest musical studio ever grace hills hollywood ; opening sequence , when " cotton blossom " pulls one many river towns draws stampeding crowd men , women , children , old young , black white , even delightedly watched two " shady ladies " lacy wrought-iron balcony , one best scenes it .

my new year resolution see bunch movies i'd always intended see but continually seemed miss . somewhat belatedly i'm fulfilling my resolution , which why i finally saw westworld . although it somewhat dated , i surprised how much i enjoyed this . film concerns delos , resort future allows guests visit either three theme parks where behavior frowned upon modern world engaged without repercussion . guests engage orgiastic sex , feasting heavy drinking , killing opponents just sheer fun it . one choose doing this roman world , medieval world , or westworld . film focuses primarily two visitors westworld , played richard benjamin james brolin . this one last sci-fi films made before onset personal computer , yet one first actually utilize computers making it . according one book i recently read , cgi representing vision field gunslinger robot first use computers generate images film history . so , this way it could considered cutting edge . other hand , when things start going wrong number robots , head technology delos describes ailment " disease . " today we'd obviously describe this virus their software . " westworld " clearly stock warner brothers western set used approximately same time blazing saddles . this works well film it gives viewer image seems weirdly familiar ( though understandably familiar , since it used dozens movies hundreds television episodes ) . so visitors park get pretty much western experience prior media would conditioned them expect . even bad guys seem familiar . yul bryner , instance , wears exactly same outfit he wore when he starred magnificent seven . visitors quickly fall into routine , james brolin doing obvious imitation clint eastwood richard benjamin quickly breaking out mold somewhat nerdy lawyer . they visit local brothel , kill robot played yul bryner couple times , get arrested break out jail shoot sheriff , get drunk middle huge brawl . then things go wrong major scale , robots going killing spree . highpoint film long chase richard benjamin yul bryner . remake westworld currently development . i am normally opposed remakes . most part remakes pale imitations originals , even case most sci-fi films . remakes invasion body snatchers inferior original , while original planet apes vastly superior remake . but this one instance where , if correctly , remake could improve upon original . film well , but it made well before computers came dominate cultural life . result , computerized control room looks absurdly primitive . instance , there no keyboards , but only consoles buttons switches knobs . danger , course , going overboard special effects . temptation all too often go overboard cgi spectacular effects ; such cases story sacrificed spectacle . my hope they keep this under control keep enhancements minimum . all all , this very enjoyable different sci-fi film . it directed written michael crichton i couldn't help but think throughout it how similar overall premise crichton creation : jurassaic park . both deal things going wrong technologically advanced theme parks . substitute dinosaurs robots or vice versa you essentially same movie .	-1
this wonderfully creepy movie . one my favorites .	1
i watched this movie no particular bias wal-mart . i understand this movie made same way political ads , where they try really hard skew facts make viewer emotional reaction half story provided . i think most people it highly effective , but it didn't work me . i think this excellent movie show example skew , perspective , propaganda . when they talk sweatshops china honduras i found myself -- though i dont envy workers -- laughing movie . i used live china i many factories conditions they make seem exclusive universal over there . it film makers then ex-employees ( they assuming viewers ) who putting their cultural assumptions how sad it they work so hard get paid so little , but other countries fact life nothing wal-mart . cultural governmental problem within countries where factories exist , not only problem wal-mar t.t he movie also discuss how wal-mart employees burden government because fact wal-mart pays very little then suggests it employess go public assitance , but truth same fast-food companies everywhere else pays minimum wage offers little benefits . i believe wal-mart should morally proivide their employees more wages provide more full-time positions , but business culture expands well past wal-mart . i am teacher who cannot work more than 17 hours week so they not give me benefits , but i don't see anyone trying make movies ban schools .	-1
first episode near end ( good ep ! ) freezes up becomes pixelated , second episode not even begin . i just watched third episode it played fine , but i exchange this . i buy this preowned shop but i don't think problem ( discs spotless ) . i seen this variety freezing up it almost certainly due double sided discs . i say out two eps . i seen i am sad murphy gone . i like anti-chemistry them but i see also how one season enough it . we all knew there no way remington not going get girl anyway . i truly like doris roberts lot this show she seems perfect fit , plus she very good actress . watch part episode 3 when she telling rem she let him down wants quit ; if those aren't geniune tears ... i'm remington steele :) might i add ; there really really really needs soundtrack released this series . first episode acapulco amazing soundtrack themes stuff legend . anyone listening out there record land ?	-1

... which more than i say modern couple . if you expect see gwyneth paltrow take her clothes off , don't bother this movie . she plays frigid arrogant scholar , which not too much stretch her . my opinion , she not romantic damsel-in-distress material . she much more interesting when she plays cold cynical characters . jennifer ehle , other hand , shows quite bit skin . clandestine love scene two poets still stands before my eyes . i read book , so i could tell movie left too many loose ends untied . instance , it not clear movie why gwyneth paltrow character crying .	-1
this way comedy should done- warm , funny , hear t-t ouching , little craziness thrown . hector elizondo raquel welch perfect- he understated , she over top ... just like movie . story never bogs down , but zips right nicely . sisters bicker , their father worries , hortensia ( welch ) her best snag him , we laugh . great fun ! note rating parents like me who wonder pg13 rating ( one never tell these days ! ) : there one woman shown skimpy underclothing , one sex scene sexual references jokes , so this would not suitable kids	1
there few movies which warrant 5 star rating me . if i could give trainspotting 10 stars i would . me , movie stay you long after credits roll . it make you think feel . it subject you roller coaster ride emotions . trainspotting delivers goods . so many described movie what it , i am not going . suffice it say movie make you cry , piss-your-pants laugh , think , cheer wildly discuss it your friends years after you first saw it . i remember nagging feeling i needed take shower after seeing it . , my friends , sign great movie . great feature trainspotting soundtrack . it features many my favorites , iggy pop , lou reed , etc . soundtrack perfect this movie . everytime i hear lust life iggy pop now , i automatically think trainspotting . sign great movie . if only it would get criterion release ...	1
bob roberts relevant today it some fourteen years ago . converting ideological outsiders not seem its primary goal . it echo chamber entertainment meant only already committed leftist . needless point out , this not exactly surprising . tim robbins , after all , who starred , directed , even sang film one hollywood best know radical personalities . blunt , he less talented oliver stone . script turns conservatives into cartoon characters . there no attempt whatsoever try understanding their world view . they simplistically portrayed fascists seeking any excuse justify taking over country . bob roberts ( tim robbins ) republican u.s. senatorial candidate hoping defeat incumbent pennsylvanian democrat brickley paiste ( gore vidal ) . he vile not above using dirty tricks achieve his aims . story unfolds , roberts well behind polls . leftist journalist portrayed giancarlo esposito tries further derail roberts ' campaign revealing his drug running other criminal activities . he successful ? journalist representing small left-wing publication take down rich powerful ? you not glued your seat due suspense , but story line isn't complete bore . if nothing else , you see countless well known motion picture stars come go throughout story . you ever wonder why far-left became unglued over iraqi liberation 2003 ? well , bob roberts should help enlighten you . it makes numerous references desert storm , our first invasion iraq 1991 . conflict allegedly conspiracy concocted devious right-wing " national security council . " this group really runs country , not our elected leaders . republican administration george bush 41 only wanted dominate region . our greedy military-industrial complex satisfied , would not take no answer . saddam hussein not adolph hitler --- but minor league dictator . senator brickley paiste dismisses him merely member " villain month club .

this wonderful film which gets 10 my rating scale . one marks enduring film me characters continue life -- they still live -- after film ended . i like many movies , but very few created such way impart self-contained life people within movie . pelle conquerer such movie . films john cassavetes also create characters which continue live -- gena rowland character " woman under influence " or man trying revive his lover who taken overdose " faces " . these characters aging father played marvelously max von sydow his son , pelle , live !! i felt i absolutely there after my visitation -- they all continuing their lives	1
when this came out i really not know what it so i ignored it watched other movies . one day i rental store i looking around i seen it shelf so i took chance got it finally after all these years . this movie suprised me because i not think it would good because young writers matt damon ben affleck new not any experience all . story good it worked some how . i recommend people who not seen take look it those who seen good you . i bought movie after i rented it but i recommend people rent then make decision	1
roger ebert called this film one most powerful movies he'd ever seen . yeah , i guess it . this movie , directed hughes brothers(from hell , dead presidents ) portrays life hood no other movie before . it powerful , unapologetic , presents us characters we should no sympathy whatsoever . oddly enough though , we . movie begins caine ( tyrin turner ) o-dog ( larenz tate ) walking into liquor store buy some beer . store owned korean who follow them around mysteriously . caine o-dog go their business until they're walk out o-dog shoots kills both korean takes tape them doing it . scene shows us violence unflinchingly . we then see caine back story . his father ( samuel . jackson ) died drug deal his mother died heroin overdose . he lived his religious grandparents since then , most part , raised pernell ( glenn plummer ) who now serving life prison . caine , meanwhile , helps take care pernell girlfriend ronnie ( jada pinkett ) his young son anthony , who reminds caine himself young age . rest movie events happen lives caine his homieso-dog , doc , wax , sharif , stacy , lew-loc , chauncy . drug deals , drive-by , rim stealing , car jacking , cold blooded murder , you name it . none it off limits . through all this , however , you like characters . o-dog , no matter how violent sadistic he gets still great sympathetic character . tate performance so good , i'm surprised he didn't get best supporting actor oscar nomination . tyrin turner , who i've never seen movie , amazing caine ; playing both violent street thug sensitive guy perfectly . pre-will smith , jada pinkett also great ronnieand should gotten oscar nomination best supporting actress . this important movie needs seen lot people , since it confronts lot social issues simalar way movies like american history , boyz hood , even scarface before . hughes brothers crafted masterwork , powerfully entertaining movie . grade : a+	1
this film bit over analyzed . when i first saw film , i really didn't care analytical makeup film , but more intrigued story very troubled teenager : donnie ( jake gyllenhaal ) . very original script , great acting , film bit difficult label genre . so i won't label it . donnie living his own reality this film , although i not seen director cut , nor i wish , original very good it . when donnie begins seeing six-foo t-t all rabbit , you know there problem . help his psychiatrist , medications , family trying help him , donnie still out reach . donnie fascination time-travel also very good concept film ; because viewer , you're not sure if this his reality , or if his reality manipulated . me , i saw donnie young boy who troubled . much film leaves you wondering , i like films sometimes . not all time , but it works this film . this very good film . highly recommended viewers . look number reviews however , it appears quite few people liked film . [ well some who not ] . i don't claim expert knowing all hidden meanings film , [ nor one needed ] however , one who like good films , recognize very good film , this film definetly classic one . part patrick swayze particular , so-called self-help guru , very good . donnie even his state mind able recognize charlton manipulator . film comes you different directions , everyone see something different film , however , me , one part stands out very much six-foot-rabbit . i believe if i saw six-foot rabbit looked like donnie , i'd run like hell .	1
this one my all-time favorite movies . read book if you want backstory since screenplay starts half point . it entertaining that why we see movies first place , right ? matt damon just so darn likeable , you get drawn into his narration right off bat . screenplay very well . it coppola film , after all ... he work some talented people . it very nice see theresa wright this film , well .	1
this great film preceded onset " jlo . " " out sight " great showcase jennifer lopez talent actress . it shame she hasn't presented more great roles , like karen sisco , this film . karen d.a , who carries rifle jaded attitude . she chance encounter charming , compulsive bank robber jack foley ( george clooney ) . their encounter made especially intriguing because it takes place following his would-be kidnapping sisco her own car . it no surprise sparks fly ..... however , this doesn't downplay complexities their star-crossed encounter . some greatest strong points this film include juxtaposition flashbacks , incorporating trick camera work voice overs . what more , this film shot very bare bones style . we don't get sense romance , so much feeling stark reality . colors dark , dialogue characters honest , real simply wonderful . this film potential mass appeal , due fact , though it get gritty violent , doesn't downplay its intelligence or originality . violence counterbalanced genuinely funny scenes , well more introspective glimpses how characters turned out they . this definitely great date film !!	1
how he come up this crazy stuff . he tells one bizarre story after end they all tie up together . it makes no seinfeld all right . this great dvd -- enjoy	1
sixth sense unbreakable so much better than signs , i'm sorry say whatever . night shyamalan originally , he lost . when sixth sense came out , he tipped next big thing , but i'm sorry say , it no longer there . my mind , he cannot match any films up success sheer uniqueness sixth sense . signs just fails miserably . concept good idea , but execution terrible . it reminded me very much blair witch project , what little action there happens off screen , torches well . it also definitely not mel gibson best film . even actors appear struggle dialogue-heavy script , not really much happens . apart one brief glimpse alien . oooh . fascinating . problem i think signs , it already following many other , far superior , alien movies . aliens attacking earth , lots more memorable than this . there also overly religious theme , which film probably would better either toning down , or scrapping altogether . it really just thrown try justify what happening film . scenes gibson his kids his brother way too sentimental really cringeworthy . finale doesn't really make film better . discovery naked aliens find water like acid their skin atrocious ! why come earth , surface mostly covered water , atmosphere full water droplets vapour ?! then they travel millions light years far advanced technology - then can't break into wooden house ?! you kidding me ? but most ridiculous thing not only characters not pay attention dogs , who sensed something not right ( time get myself dog ) , but fact all sophisticated radar equipment cannot detect aliens entering our atmosphere - but baby monitor ?! huh ?! film stay well away . thankfully , i didn't spend my hard earned ( ha ! ) money it , but borrowed it friend . i shall approach . night shyamalan films trepidation now . oh , when director decides give himself speaking role his own film , make it short one	-1

there little say this movie , since i assume people interested buying this item already seen it already . but amount quality extras this dvd just breathtaking . say least , disc 2 imax version film , which time this writing not documented here amazon . imax version , well :) , shorter version film ( 1h55 ' versus 2h20 ' regular ) aspect ratio 1:66 . so if you unsure buy widescreen or fullscreen versions , i suggest buying wide , since you get ( sort ) full screen version imax one present disc 2 . then there this documentary " conquest space " which rather dull , " astronauts story " very short but interesting clip , excellent " making " juicy commentary jim lovell , pinpointing hits misses film compared real thing . $9.90 , how you not buy this jewel	1

live stage , trevor nunn production extroardinary , one best theatre performances i ever seen . video doesn't totally capture power ; it may wise , television director , de-emphasize stage set ( black magic circle outlined wood floor , surrounded wooden crates ) , such brilliant theatrical images invading thanes , surrounding macbeth circle , he slumps crate throne his ramshackle bunker ; but those features part what made stage version unforgettable . however , video preserve wonderful performances . i must dissent some reviews below : dench superb lady macbeth late bob peck understated macduff works beautifully ; both deliver their big scenes well any production you ever see . mckellen , this signature role his career . video also conveys low-key intensity furious pace this macbeth ; it rare opportunity see one great shakespearean productions century , preserved	-1

i saw john carpenter " fog " ( 1980 ) years ago kind bored it . catching it again recently , however , i impressed quite few things : -- film mood . carpenter successfully captured fitting spooky atmosphere his ghost story . ( plot involves horrific ghosts ship lepers returning enact revenge coastal community 100 years after people village guided them rocky death order swipe their chest gold ) . spooky mood nicely captured very first scene wherein john houseman shares ghost story hushed tones group kids campfire coast . -- spectacular locations . picture filmed beautiful point reyers/bodega bay region north san francisco . -- fabulous score . especially main piano piece runs during end credits . it actually blows away more popular main score carpenter " halloween . " -- good cast , which includes adrienne barbeau , jamie lee curtis , hal holbrook , nancy kyes janet leigh . unpredictable finish . i know this horror flick people supposed die , but it nice see people not die change . it refreshing ! bottom line : if you're looking fast-paced slasher gore-fest , you not like this film . if , however , you're mood something spooky , atmospheric aesthetically pleasing , " fog " likely trip your trigger	-1
alias : season 4 . wow . characters through heck first three seasons , much it caused man named arvin sloane , afterwards group called covenant . stroke genius , now best both sd-6 cia combined into apo , headed up ( guess who ? ) arvin sloane , guy everybody loves hate . usual cast jennifer garner , michael vartan , victor garber , ron rifkin , etc . accompanied absolutely adorable mia maestro , who plays sydney half-sister nadia santos . throw some nice guest stars like angela bassett , some derevko sisters ( yes , plural ) person or two who you probably thought dead , you've got great season , culminating ultimate family team-up take down terrible rambaldi device could trigger next apocalypse ! course ... chosen one must battle passenger . only one ... survive . unless you want either one next season , which case , they might live . but i'm not sayin ' if they both survive or not , ' cause that'd spoiler . big shocker very end season , wow . let just say not everyone who they claim . now i don't know what happens season 5 , except somebody gets clip or two unloaded ' em there probably double or clone or two somewhere there . ( i saw few moments series finale ... not knowing how great show it time . ) whatever case , while i admit there creepy episode or two there , season 4 comes strong well-deserved place amongst other three seasons , all which i enjoyed . trust me , you won't let down season 4 if you enjoyed other three . i highly recommend it	1

quite astounding when it first came out , your values may changed bit since you first saw this film way back when . definitely benchmark cinema , regardless your revisionist take fellini " values " . i couple technical issues dvd ( i bought it 2001 ): 1 ) lip-synch error pervades entire disc - dialog lags actors mouths consistent noticeable fraction second . 2 ) pivotal scene film , death hermaphrodite white hot desert canyon , intentionally over-exposed film appear almost completely washed out screen . dvd production house " corrected " this exposure , which now looks muddy lacks its original magic meaning . amazon replaced my first copy - same deal . too bad either fellini wasn't well enough oversee these types technical details , or else people designated this him couldn't bothered their job . or maybe it fixed now . caveat emptor	-1

2 fast 2 furious one those sequels comes around every so often doesn't require you seen original . i saw this movie first time not too long after it came out , never seen original , i thought i would lost wouldn't enjoy myself much other people , but contrary - i left experience much happier than when i came . this film full quick one-liners deserve laugh . special effects car races leave your mouth gaping open . i heard read people didn't appreciate this film much because it seemed focus more plot than first film rather than focus more races , but overall , i think balance works well . even thinking plot we left , i really can't see time when race would even appropriate . people saying this film worse than original , i would disagree ... why ? frankly , i always firm believer than vin diesel entirely overrated actor . ( i mean , c'mon - you seen pacifier ? ) he nothing more than meat head who , while able pretty good fight scenes , should leave dialogue someone else . yes , this film younger crowd , there numerous occasions when unbelievable events take place ( take boat jumping example ) , but there no saying older person wouldn't enjoy it well ... only thing i say you really shouldn't go into this film expecting oscar worthy performance , or else you disappointed . if you sit back take this fun romp it , however , you thoroughly enjoy yourself	1

i saw theatrical version vhs many years ago , it didn't really make sense . i thought maybe it because it david lynch film , it wasn't supposed ... then i remembered it based frank herbert incredibly complex sci-fi classic , decided 2 hour film couldn't coherent . then i taped tv 4 hour version ; editing commercials , it came 3 hours . there narration someone english accent ; i couldn't understand word . then , 20 years later , dvd , lynch extended version directed alan smithee ( ed wood anonymity ) . i watched extended version other day , it entertaining . one thing new dvd : side one lynch version , side 2 ( extended ) completely unlabeled . certainly , some action scenes intriguing . sets ( background artwork ) certainly visionary , wide 2.35 : 1 lbx very well presented . also , narration different person than tv version i'd taped those years ago . i understood every word . why mr. lynch took his name off film escapes me . i actually enjoyed lot film . there especially fine performances jose ferrer , max von sydow , sting , francesca annis , dean stockwell brad dourif . kyle maclachlan used his customary stiff acting approach good advantage , carrying lead role quite well . handsome guy ... aficianados pull this film apart without mercy , herbert fans probably same , but i watch films entertained i . it not great , not always coherent , but it great put during rainy saturday afternoon . purists , stay away ; film fans sci-fi freaks , enjoy !	-1

what amazing this production even though many story elements changed , strength each story preserved it essence . i read most this series over time come love character rebus . he truly ' real ' person , all foibles warts each us . he terrible interpersonal relationships , his best when he doing everything his power , not show emotion . though he not write screenplays , ian rankin very much involved making these teleplays ( see secion making rebus his comments ) , you see his deft touch minor changes made . siobhan clark supposed attractive , her late twenties , scots/english accent ; actress who plays her none these . brian holmes nowhere found , neither dr patience aikens . but actors who plays big ger cafferty ' weasel ' spot . hannah rebus able show great understanding character , who grey tough his home city . my only complaint he little young aging rebus who should his late forties . minor complaint . plethora scots accents ; it hard enough trying guess what some words mean , without trying figure out what people saying . but , i guess they wanted authenticity since it made scottish tv , didn't care what us yanks understood . ya think i get version subtitles	1

let me start saying first movie series absolutely fantastic . regardless fact it didn't stick few key plotlines book , everyone still great job adapting original jurassic park . then came this piece trash ... whereas first movie least attempted loosely base itself book , this one just takes brilliant writing michael chrichton throws it directly out window . first off , john hammond supposed dead . he dies end first novel . secondly ian malcome supposedly dead , or least mia end first book , we join him costarican hospital opening 2nd . there no bratty daughter , entire premise much more it . most importantly ... entire ending san diego t-rex ... which possibly worst conceived plot line history movies ... not exist book ! i went into this movie expecting tightly woven plot , huge concentration conspiracy such island exist , anticipation some good dino-scenes top it off . what i ended up getting writing equivalent monkey typewriter drooling page . not only ... but because lack plot , dino scenes complete over-kill . when you see so much it , you lose awe wonder first film . when you see brachiosaur first 20 mins original film , wonderment difficult rival . there no such moments this film . if you're looking quick fix decent looking dino fx , go nuts . however , if you're looking something more substantial actual plotline , flick off dvd player pick up book . oh one more thing ... don't go near 3rd movie . they didn't even book untrue . i can't imagine how much more long-winded rambling my review would one	-1
what relief watch my beloved qaf after trainwreck known sopranos season 6 ... i purchased season one qaf after watching one half episode season five . characters wonderful moment you remind yourself these actors . this straight little girl iowa loves queer folk would recommend it anyone . it comforting escape after hard day work , fight bf , etc ... i've got almost entire series purchased , but it pricey . i suppose they figure if people willing spend dough , they'll charge outrageous amounts it . i'd pay double mine ... love it	1
sorry give you bad news this dvd set , but ... i love kids hall , but found complete season one dissapointing . i remember some wonderful very humorus skits season one not included this set ... such crushing head man his friend misha who interupts play he putting . actors his play his fingers . he goes crush her head , she sticks her thumb front one eye says " there no body home " , so it appears her thumb covering his head ... but this skit isn't here . why ? lover head crusher , only head crushing episodes season one when he crushes business men heads runs into little boy suit asks him " what you want when you grow up ? " little boy responds " business man ! " -- he consquently gets his head crushed . funny , but not best or most memorable head crusher . i also disspointed buddy cole this dvd set . there some wonderful buddy cole segments first season not this set ( how one when he jail his tin cup shaped like champagne glass ? ) , same chicken lady ( blind date , attending wedding bearded lady , or phone sex line ) cabbage head ( i loved it when he invited himself join bunch women who trying dinner , he sits lawn chair sex book asks questions ) . i also loved skit where woman ( played one kids drag ) sits outdoor cafe , annoyed terrible waiter suffers further aggravation " dirty man standing behind fence " who trying bum cigarettes " his kids " her . or , how guy stubbed his toe doesn't want go doctor because he found colors his infected toe " interesting ! " not one these hillarious skits or episodes included season one dvd collection ... why ? god only knows who compiled collection sometimes boring comedy skits season one dvd collection , but i tell you one thing . there no way this complete collection entire season one episodes . it incomplete , say least . i just gave you many examples my favorites missing . it would great see them again them enjoy posterity . it kind humor endeared us all kids hall so much . skits included this collection probably not most popular or funny episodes . i would not recommend it . take it me ... save yourself twenty or thirty bucks . i not seen other dvd collections other kids hall seasons dvd yet . one only hope they more entertaining than season one ( or should i say , wasn't ) ... p.s. i would not even rated this dvd set one star , but it lowest rating you give item .	-1

problem this film i read book . i disappointed simply because `be cool ' obvious showcase musical talent . overly long dance sequence john travolta uma thurman prime example . somewhere bulk story lost -- there some very -- very good characters appearing film would've more intersing if somebody would've said , " hey , don't forget book ! " but true original source not hollywood strong suit . " cool " provides some popular music , some known faces , but without john travolta , movie would never made . few laughs provided . couple ironic scenes show up , but there too little sustain full-length feature . basically , project disservice everyone involved . some characters so thin -- face it -- poor christina milian linda moon , reduced voice sways when she sings -- clich� . rock best he but again , `he gay bodyguard;' he brunt insulting jokes offered up raji , his boss [ vince vaughn ] , who , book , far more sinister -- but film he idiot . course chili chili . travolta very nice job , chili obviously smartest guy room . uma thruman performance , well , not funny -- not serious , not intense -- not much -- best , she made me shrug . i like what harvey keitel nick carr , but there just not enough , all negatives reflect completely director . enough said there . my advice , watch `get shorty'again , or read `be cool .

4.5 stars this release , i am sorry they didn't actual orginal ending it seems say it packaging , bod form dvd producers . but i am not one those rabid duckie fanatics seem think even though andie duckie no chemistry they belonged together . obviously she loved him brother not potential love interest 180 least this film just wouldn't work ! if you want ending go see some kind wonderful ending two leads obvious chemistry story supports change ! people people people , entire film supposed fact labels folks put you wrong no matter what side tracks you live you still good person . but all i hear complaints how duckie didn't get girl . well folks i've never twenty years i adored this film thought he should am glad they not lucas changed film reflect . i would like seen scene however why this dvd gets 4.5 stars instead 5	-1

i cannot believe how wonderful this collection . there six movies this set . all which i already my collection . however , quality 3 6 moview far surpasses anything i able find previously . " true confession " , " love before breakfast " " man world " all excellent picture sound . it my understanding there no surviving master prints " true confession " . so i congragulate person who found this high quality copy sitting somewhere back some studio vaul t.t he other three titles , " we're not dressing " , " hands across table " " princess comes across " dark prints comparison previous versions issued video cassette 1995 mca/universal , but otherwise highly watchable . sound quality these movies also excellent . this collection while you , price it steal . it well worth $100 or more	1
it hard know where begin this one . movie immaculately filmed one greatest directors all time , given just most perfect presentation i've ever seen dvd . i guess i'll start print : it magnificent , beautiful , golden colors , sharp focus , barely speck dust film . one would expect kurosawa film , composition feast eyes , beautiful formal balances coming most mundane elements shot . ( george lucas very influenced kurosawa many ways , but this sort beautiful , balanced composition one thing he never mastered . ) then there score . most people might not immediately think score when discussing kurosawa film , but i struck here how powerful distinctive it , while same time it never gets way film . then there sets : simple , yet used maximum effect . this not big budget film hollywood standards ( though it most expensive japanese film up time ) , but it feels far more epic than any recent , very expensive star wars " prequels , " which just goes show it takes more make epic than just money . kurosawa reportedly only used something like 200 horsemen , yet you'll think you're seeing far more . then there cast . tatsuya nakadai , lord ichimonji , manages perfectly portray man going man who both frightening his stubbornness sympathetic his pathos same time . not easy job , especially under ton makeup made him look far older than he . three sons , played akira terao , jinpachi nezu especially daisuke ryu ( insightful loyal saburo ) distinctive well-developed . androgynous peter ( first name billed only ) kyoami memorable his flamboyant , almost drag-queen gyrations taunting aging , increasingly senile warlord insights into his predicament . yet standout performance , one i always remember , stunning mieko harada lady kaede . while ran supposedly loose retelling king lear , kaede more lady macbeth than anything else . she two very memorable scenes both involve severed heads . while screenplay riffs lear , it also makes some notable changes . three daughters replaced three sons . this " lear " goes mad not because daughter love but because , apparently , weight wars fought past . young lord very odds image we see beginning film , man wishing make peace his demons . we discover through backstory he killed , kidnapped waged much violence bring together his kingdom , yet now he just wants peace goodwill . i thinking adage what goes around comes around , wondered if hidetora himself ever came this realization . it what he thinking he emerged burning castle after tremendous battle , dazed , wordless ? scene , shot without ambient sound but haunting score ( composed toru takemitsu ) , must go down one greatest moments film , example how cinema used way no other art form . bonus features both bountiful meaningful . first there full-length commentary film scholar stephen prince , though i confess i've not yet listened it . director sidney lumet gives brief appreciation kurosawa ran . he likens film late beethoven quartets or seventh symphony . such comparisons often come off glib or meaningless , but this actually struck chord me . i indeed think comparison ran energies seventh apt , introspection reminds me late quartets , particularly op . 132 . second disc , we a.k. , 75 minute documentary kurosawa life . ( case you've seen recent pbs documentary kurosawa , this one different . ) then comes half hour film making ran , which shows what grueling shoot it must , going every day base mount fuji often working there even night . finally there 35-minute video piece exploring costumes ran , well new video interview tatsuya nakadai ( lord hidetora ) . there also color booklet interviews kurosawa composer takemitsu . short , there enough supplementary materials here keep any fan movie or director happy weeks . many criterion releases defined what dvds , but this title just takes cake . what more could one ask , short summoning kurosawa beyond talk film ? even if you own ran one its other video versions , they all vastly inferior this release . if you've never seen film , or any work akira kurosawa , this probably best place you could start . highly highly recommended	1

it indeed very nice able watch this fantastic series best quality format . however , i must agree other reviewers here who commented fact first season badly hacked . some you who may read this , but not understand what we mean , here poop . september 16 , 1970 nbc unveiled new series called " four one . " it comprised four mini-series : 1 . mccloud 2 . san francisco international airport 3 . night gallery 4 . psychiatrist each mini-series ran period six consecutive weeks . then they rerun rotation basis . they aired wednesday nights 10:00 - 11:00 . " mccloud " went " mystery movie " series , " san francisco international airport " left air " four one " series " psychiatrist . " " night gallery " spun off into it own series . disc one , " four one " episodes appear 90 minute form , combining two 60 minute episodes . what bummer ! it would really great see original " four one " opening . i seem remember square black background , they something square , moving it around or it morph into other things or something , it really hard remember because it so long ago i all 7 years old time . but , i seem remember it stopped 4 box , making it look my young mind like child block . same " mystery movie " opening . remember guy ( looked like mccloud me ) walking slowly toward camera flashlight , shining it side side shots each element series would flash up ? all while really neat whistling theme played . tv still some pretty neat things time . still , i'm glad this set . but , it would really nice original openings more importantly , first season its unaltered form .	-1
singles came out early 90 , time me , all grunge scene . i high school then so this norm us all . but i got older , i never outgrew singles . fact , i think i began relate it even more i gained more life experience . anyway , here wonderful comedy offers us all glimmer hope this overpopulated world . we meet group friends who various tennants same apartment building seattle . singles centers around cliff ( dillon ) struggling musician , his girlfriend janet ( fonda ) who put cliff needs before her own last time , linda ( sedgwick ) who thinks she found " one " until she discovers him bar girl when he told her he going back spain , steve ( scott ) who spent his dating career playing field , debbie ( kelley ) who searches mr. right via video dating service ( oh-so hilarious ) . main story linda steve meeting relationship blossoms it . if you big fan grunge when it popular you'll fall love singles ( bands like soundgarden , mother love bone , even alice chains featured ) . many funny moments abound ( this shouldn't spoil anything you should you 1 person left wyoming or something who hasn't seen this movie ) including run-in pessimistic mime ( played eric stoltz ) , debbie dating video steve story learning sex child , but that all i say without giving it all away . price this low , singles steal it something you watch again again again .	1

so long , i avoided working out because some really negative feelings i've attached process . i still vivid pictures my mind getting dressed dowdy gym clothes , fighting traffic , waiting use machines i wasn't really sure how use first place ! there times when i take two hours out my day just exercise less than half time . i think my gym experience might better i hired personal trainer , but let face it -- not all us money this , especially broke students like me . i little more luck treadmill some tae-bo , but found intense cardio didn't particularly agree my joints or my downstairs neighbors . ;) then , sometime few years later , i found bar method . i initially very skeptical low-impact workout because i always thought more dog-tired hyperventilated i felt after workout , better it me . ultimately , i really just setting myself up failure because every workout turned out most stressful part my day ! not so bar method . yes , exercises very , very tough killer muscles , but you aren't huffing puffing feeling sick way i always more " traditional " cardio workouts . best part i know i'm working just hard i ever burning just much fat . bar method exactly what it promises : consistent , 3-times-a-week schedule , even lazy girls like me slim their hips , flatten their abdominals , tighten their arms , define their legs . greatest surprises i just how well exercises worked my hips ( very problem area me ) my arms ( which became tight , but not all bulky . ) i designer sculpting more than fat free , but i find both workouts well-paced enjoyable . burr leonard her assistants rather likeable provide very specific directions each exercise ( good thing beginner-level students ) . so why four stars , not five ? i find music dvds little dull side . i try remedy problem listening my ipod , but found i just didn't get much workouts without burr explanations encouragements . also , i find abdominals sections both dvds leaves something little lacking me . yes , my abs get flatter , but i still didn't feel like i really " worked " them -- fact , they barely felt sore next day , unlike rest me , which positively killed . these days , i find myself doing abs section shape magazine " bikini body all year long " morning , then doing bar method sections arms , seat , thighs later day . this useful me , but might very disruptive someone who likes their workout one full chunk . i'm using other dvds now , too , but somebody who needs little bit kickstart get back into working out , bar method great way fun get fit	-1

this stirring film . robert de niro christopher walken both outstanding - this movie would not half entertaining without them . beginning , you get sense lives these young men . they free fun-loving - yet everything change them . they proud serve their country , but they exposed side life no one should ever see . scenes set vietnam during war truly intense shocking . after horrors these men witness , you not surprised see them become disenchanted distant . how you return functioning society after immersed war death most horrific kind ? it seems , tragically , most simpy can't readjust ... who hell blame them ? this movie doesn't tackle war whole . instead , it shows you very concentrated story involving only few men . you see their experiences vietnam eventual playing out their individual fates . it very disturbing see nick ( walken ) alive after all time when michael ( de niro ) returns saigon finally finds him . he shell his former self , lifeless eyes empty soul - thanks solely war . again , without christopher walken robert de niro , this movie wouldn't half good . their performances excellent	-1

" medium " instantly became my favorite show television 2005 . i usually am fascinated shows elements paranormal , which tuned me . however , it realism family relationship most fascinating . patricia arquette who " ed wood " johnny depp plays alison dubois . her emmy win best actress drama attests her standing within industry , but on-screen chemistry jake weber who " meet joe black " plays her husband joe riveting . they fight , spat , try mask conflict front their kids , juggle impossible number real-life tasks , layers humor romance make this seem like real family loves each other deals unusual circumstances alison psychic ability . i found after watching initial show when reruns would show , i still wanted watch them over episodes csi miami i not seen . when i bought dvd , i hoping there might episode i'd missed , but i'd seen them all nbc lifetime reruns several times . i'm impressed how entrancing each episode quality writing . alison dreams like clues she struggles fit together . what impresses me alison she sincerely struggles right thing . world violence , it often hard clear which way moral compass points . episode " sickness adultery " her tip places her witness stand unethical hostile prosecutor seeks embarrass her . she comes back he cheated pass his law exams cheating his wife , she finds her best defense truth . two older daughters also jewels . maria lark bridget often my entire family stitches her offbeat humor like shouting her mom who wakes screaming bad dream , " mom , please stop doing ! " sofia vassilieva older aerial keeps arguments breakfast table bouncing . david cubitt who plays reoccurring role detective lee scanlon also achieves amazing chemistry arquette . miguel sandoval district attorney manuel duvalos such focused calmness he centers crime portion show . ( perhaps we sometime see more his family . ) while it hard pick my favorite first season episode , complex plot " priest , doctor medium walk into execution chamber " jewel , police chasing ghost who apparently just committed murder . dvd commentaries introduction real-life alison dubois really give excellent background fans show . this one show reaches level art me . its excellence make it memorable long time this dvd collection valuable addition entertainment collection . bravo	1
wasted talent . none characters believable roles they portraying . some funny stuff . craig ferguson better . charlotte church should stick singing acting not her forte . every thing this movie seems forced there no chemistry characters	-1
many ways , ridley scott films remind me brian de palma's: many people consider him filmmaking icon , notable director among many many other ones making good or bad films . sure de palma his scarface his untouchables but don't forget he also forgettable snake eyes mission mars . ridley scott meanwhile alien gladiator(overrated personally ) but he white squall 1692 but chalk blade runner up his more memorable films its probably one better made sci-fi films 80 . it 2017 mankind developed replicants , humanoids who look very similar humans used degrading work . after they decide revolt , humans start making specialists - blade runners - " retire " replicants , other words , kill . they bring deckard , retired blade runner , track down replicants who recently escaped all while falling love one . lot futuristic films seem very ambitious where technology reaches point where anything possible . interstellar travel , flying cars , sophisticated id systems holographs very present these kind films but oddly , blade runner doesn't much . while it some scenes involving flying cars going over neon-lit cities woman face building , when we're ground level technology isn't apparent . it helps film feel real plausible without looking too ambitious its own good . it interesting note although film considered sci-fi film , it kind light action scenes . it not big deal but when you look main cover art , deckard gun hand , but people thinking this going slam-bang action film ridley scott might disappointed . i surely expecting it but seeing film , good it , i like " wow , not lot fast parts " . then again , alien deliberate pacing so i guess it expected . those you wondering , this isn't super deluxe edition where we different versions film(that 2007 ) , so this one we only get remastered version film better transfer . so if you want replace your crappy original director cut version horrible main menu crappy transfer , go ahead but if you want more bang your 30 40$ whatever it come up , wait till 2007	1

i like this new mature van damme . first hell now wake death they're best films his career he actually starting show some genuine acting talent . i hope this trend continues . wife/family murdered son kidnapped van damme ( or v.d. i like call him ) out revenge . he shoots up bunch stuff , runs drill through guy kneecaps , wrecks some cars , cries few times , drives motorcycle through mall , hugs some people , electrocutes cop shoots triad who tied up point blank face shotgun . honestly i liked this movie quite bit , ending little anti-climatic , but cinematography cool . i'd watch it again which more than i could say double team .	-1

clueless thoroughly delightful film , this edition improves it excellent bonus features - all good , but fashion 101 not missed . despite its glossy veneer - world populated attractive , narcissistic , privileged kids - clueless smart , droll , endearing look inside youth culture . because it touches universal themes , fully operational when jane austen wrote emma , film withstands test time despite language ( if ) fashion trends ( droopy drawers skaters ) , fads , average life span drosophila . many viewers approach clueless certain amount hostility . cher , protagonist , played perfection alicia silverstone , impossibly beautiful . worse still , her father , gruff but charmingly protective dan hedaya , beyond rich . even worse , cher seems live entirely surface things , expressing her creativity through social meddling wardrobe . ( outfits worn cher , her friend dionne , others their inner circle reason enough watch film . ) how could we ever like such wretched , spoiled kids ? because , clueless beautifully executed , gentle satire , not broad farce or biting indictment . writer/director amy heckerling , ( who also fast times ridgemont high - lesser endeavor ) , understands loves her characters , they not stereotypes . we like these kids because they joke , they know they're hothouse orchids . blatant examples include murray , played donald faison ( now scrubs ) black uber-yuppie who learns his street patois mtv , jeremy sisto elton who apparently hobbled his identity together rat pack press photos . stage beautifully set , comedy manners begins , cher manipulates people order serve her idea greater social good learns few lessons way . no one shot . no helicopters appear . inept driving featured , but there no car chases . wonder wonders , especially teen movie , there no gratuitous sex . amy heckerling saluted creating film relies story , dialogue , detail , character , acting work . her success complete . clueless uses socal youth culture its milieu , not its point . really pleasure worth owning	1
awesome movies , but way too expensive product itself . first , i bought it reduced priced , since it left sitting shelve collecting dust few years store . they dropped price initial $200 ( around $150 u . . ) , $149 ( around $110 u . . ) , cheapest price i could find it my city far . few stores told me their cost around $149 , so it able buy it around cost . considering , it bargain , so i got lucky start . now movies , they awesome , after watching them all two days , i felt sad , sad hollywood current level movie making , after tasting piece history , movies deep , funny , either deals issues ( seven samurai hidden fortress ) or don't ( yojimbo sanjuro ) , they all movie gems . but we also realistic here , seven samurai my opinion real champion this set , it everything , it epic , yet personal , it deep , yet sometime funny , but always powerful superb . now quality disk , where it hard tell , these old movies . but something struck me odd , seven samurai ( 7s ) , around 10 yrs before yojimbo sanjuro but looks sound better , obviously , they cleaned it out little before putting it dvd , but then , if yojimbo sanjuro where made 10 yrs later , someone should expect least equal quality , if not better then 7s , but it not case , especially yojimbo painful watch , sound track loud background hiss least half movie , scratches big straw last full min multiple times , contrast brightness out wack half scenes , it painful experience , you tell yourself how great movie , but it ever ugly watch . so far i would give it 4 stars , why then i give it 2 ? it down price vs quality extras . no extras what so ever beside theater trailer each movie , commentary track 7s , then nothing . so criterion my mind two choice , drop price 1/3 1/2 what it now , or pick better original copy bring dvd , clean it , add extras , selling it same price it now , but they neither . they used yojimbo , terribly copy , add nothing , charge full criterion price , bad !!! so end , one fell like robbed ronins . my case , i wanted see those movies , own 7s this box set only way go doing this , end , i praise movie , acting , story , camera work , everything , except criterion dvd who brought those movies it north america , they dropped ball this one . so 0 stars criterion there dvd product ( this case ) 4 stars movie themselves so my end review 2 stars	-1
my daughters ( 14 10 time this review ) i make habit " gilmore-ing " ( ) regular basis . we buy snacks , watch most season day , talk show all way through . we relate characters personal level , yet without charm stars hollow nestle into end day unfortunately . thing , gilmore girls smart show . it throws out references so fast watching it feels energizing rather than draining . fashion year or two ahead usually , which fun . plus ,. this age clearchannel radio , it great hear lesser-known bands featured regular basis . we definitely huge fans gilmore girls , but would i enjoy it much if i not daughters ? i'm not sure . i enjoy show doesn't wrap things up neatly most time , show doesn't develop around characters who fit into " acceptable role model " slot . these characters good people who screw up they living their daily lives . they keep going , keep connecting world around them , keep loving each other . it one those shows certain parents wouldn't trust their kids able interpret . watching show single mother who makes something herself spite teenage pregnancy isn't going say " this good idea .

this one those movies they felt dressed up bit order dumb movie audience give it chance . or so this how they film studios see it anyway . this certainly message movie , its not so sutble message anti-thatcherism hits you head like brick ! americans ignorant britain today might hard time following it . however , if one disregards rather dated politics here , theme movie seen universal one long-time workers now frequently victims changing economics . more than anything else this movie music brass bands . opening march . . hall " death or glory " says it all ! players this band their fight mine death or glory proposition . incidently hall little known new england composer marches , its interesting his music should make it back acorss pond english brass bands . my personal tastes runs military bands which instrumentation richer more varied . brass bands don't any woodwinds ! softer tone they produce more mellow sound , compared richer , stirring military band . its nice see working class mines england produced these high quality bands . no comparison fond here states mine workers . you would sooner find most us blue collar workers topless bars after their shift rather than going band practice ! so these bands part england cultural scene , popular band music they played often bridge common man classical concert hall out-door band concert . their loss would certainly sad . band portrayed here film actual famous brass band , it would interesting know if it really disbanded because yorkshire mine closings . actors fine job . pete postlewaite wonderful . anything he seems golden . tara fitsgerald very appealing seductive . shes also wonderful see almost anything . plot its usual twists turns keeps interest . human dramas behind music what most compelling this film . movie should made many fine regimental bands disbanded british army recent years . like civilian band portrayed here , many these bands histories went back centuries , their loss regiments which them keen . many fine musicians them also forced into redundancy or seek non-musical employment army . certainly what blair here every bit bad what thatcher mines . destruction these many fine military bands loss communities well morale their regiments . loss any band cultural loss , whether civilian or military . young listeners today increasingly no exposure music other than dreadful pop , loss such bands truly dire situation . these musical entities their free open air concerts vital link people hear different kinds music . i can't imagine what music tastes people future . sure it won't good . this deffinitely fine movie , good plot , strong acting , some wonderful brass music . if viewers become inspired listen this kind music result this film then all should not vain . strongly recommeded despite silly box cover	1

this review contains spoilers . i wasn't aware this movie when it released heard it only recently because i got know like work actress lindsay crouse " buffy vampire slayer " " hack . " movie got high marks imdb crowd amazon.com, but i've burned way many times so expected disappointed " house games , " too . i pleasantly surprised find movie far above average . i'd put it top 10 percent all movies i've seen . i'm so glad david mamet decided make this movie his wife lead his friend joe montegna playing mike . both actors perfectly cas t.t hat said , i three minor quibbles movie . ( spoilers coming . ) first , it seemed obvious me lindsay character conned when briefcase containing $ 80,000 went missing lindsay offered reimburse con men . concomitantly , it didn't make sense lindsay character wouldn't catch point she conned . later movie , lindsay visits bar where con men hang out . she enters late night through back door , which all too conveniently unlocked . lastly , when lindsay joe their final confrontation they baggage handling area large airport . no one else around . not even close enough , apparently , hear six gunshots . but these small complaints compared overall quality movie . " house games " gem	-1

yes . wild things what i recommend our jaded eyes . aren't we sick all crowd pleasing pg-13 shows which neither sexy or action packed - most all hardly plot ? wild things sex sex sex but witty capital humor twisted story . recent eye candy shows could learn thing or two this film . candy remain sweet sickening but great script good cast ( oscar nominee matt dillon , kevin bacon etc ) turn candy into cuisine	-1
well i must say i really enjoyed this movie , i saw it awhile back tv i said next time it hit dvd i buy it . i like all roles women played . each person character or situation i relate little . we all tried give man ours chance or try there him , but it turns out they not appreciate us all . they took our niceness weakness but sooner or later its time pay back .. lol not abuse or burning down house but get them back away they not even see it coming . this movies funny , sad , joyful . i reccommend everyone see this dv	1
plot : there string unsolved murders harrison penitentiary . detective louis burke ( jean-claude van damme ) sent undercover inmate investigate . help his assigned " wife " ( charatcer amanda beckett , played cynthia gibb ) , he manages uncover few dirty secrets place . once he truly gets into heat situation , he discovers guards prison officials themselves might even involved . whole scheme starting make sense , doesn't stay good thing long . his presence prison becoming too much danger conspirors , he becomes next hitlist . but burke isn't going down easy . least that what we think , until old enemy -- christian " sandman " naylor ( patrick kilpatrick ) -- transferred prison finish him off good . fight solve murder mystery over , yet fight burkes life only beginning . death warrant action flick . period . although story interesting follow , true reason anyone would watch this would down'n'dirty mayhem van damme his usual kick-butt mode . prison conspiracy not huge government cover up , but rather small ring corruption hidden higher officials . so instead thriller bunch different suspicious characters involved , we've got van damme stuck all alone deadly prison without prayer ! that where action comes . this isn't kind " blow stuff up " or " shoot em down " popcorn movie , this hand-to-hand combat girtty intensity . best example would grand finale : final fight sandman burke ( definitely my favorite part ) . that where anything goes , barbaric brawling death only way out . note , i particularly fond patrick kilpatrick sandman . he often seen villain-type roles , but this just hits nail head . only slight complaint i ( reason it only hits four stars ) sandman doesn't enough screen time . i don't want spoil storyline , but you assume because his late arrival film , he not mystery murderer . he more like executioner sent burke . parts he get last half film -- well first scene which we see encounter naylor burke when naylor free man -- satisfying , but let face it , he one hell villain he needed more show . regardless , death warrant just what you need if you like simple yet engaging fight flick . although only special feature theatrical trailer , only reason you need purchase this dvd film itself . it quite impressive , leaves you some fond memories both van damme kilpatrick . pick it up !	-1

" fort apache " , henry fonda , new commander , fort apache , arrogant indian hating , irish-catholic disliking , wasp who seeks glory himself , no matter what cost maybe ! great perfomances fonda , wayne , george o'brien , ward bond , anna lee , irene rich , victor mclaglen , dick foran(who sings very well too ) , grant withers(as corrupt suttler ) , guy kibbe , pedro armendariz , very sympathetic " cochise " miguel inclan ! shirley temple john agar provide love interest . great movie ! great western !! america greatest director !!	1
if you considering buying this film , may i recommend you save tons money buying it bible collection box set , which contains 6 these bible movies , abraham , jacob , joseph , moses , samson delilah , david ! production values very high all six films , you pay half off cost buying each one separately ! david one best dvds this series bible movies , made mid 1990s . it covers most big scenes his life , it very well cast acted all . first hour shows young david anointed , then persecuted years under jealous king saul . second hour covers david his peak , king israel . third hour shows david sin punishment over his adultery bathsheba , god punishment using his rebellious son absalom . this all very gripping enjoyable drama , especially any bible students who enjoy seeing so many bible scenes not often portrayed other films . they cover lot scripture , without unlimited budget , so sometimes they alter some details stories . instance , famous david versus goliath battle not take place front philistine israeli armies , scripture , but rather isolation . it budgetary rewrite , but dramatic impact tension still present . filmmakers ' intentions honorable , though their budget may not ambitious enough portray some larger , more expensive scenes out scripture . if they cut some corners due budget , they more than make up it quantity quality scriptural scenes they show . one best sections dvd david adulterous relationship bathsheba , then his scheming against uriah , her husband . scenes absalom trying overthrow his father very well made , very scriptural , well . actor playing adult david brilliant performance , portraying many decades life david . leonard nimoy ( mr. spock star trek fame ) good samuel , ( though richard gere film king david definitive , ultimate onscreen chemistry samuel king saul ) . actors king saul bathsheba both very good this dvd version david . you also find three other great movies this series movies . look bible series box set featuring esther , jeremiah solomon , too . these also your best buy box set , rather than separately ! these 9 bible movies , three 90 minutes long , jacob . esther , jeremiah . other 6 around 3 hours long . i think longer ones originally aired tv mini series , over multiple nights . all these films , my one criticism might they bit weak showing some supernatural events scripture . this seems due expense special effectts , perhaps , my guess . but most part , all 9 dvds great very good actors portraying tension drama these classic bible stories , they consistently good faithful gist spirit bible stories they tell . i think these 9 dvds best series bible dvds available anywhere ! there better , single movies dvd , but group , whole , there not bigger , better dvd set available anywhere , i know . these box sets perfect basis any personal or church library bible movies . they virtually all so close scripture you forced compare films actual bible hand , verify whether or not scene accurate scripture or not . very good bible learning exercise , it shows high value quality owning these dvds . all 9 these bible dvds worth buying owning any christian personal dvd library , most frugally purchased via two different box sets ! highly recommended	1

fuss over forrest gump still amazes me . this movie basically rips off better movies almost every scene . still somehow it managed win best picture over pulp fiction shawshank redemption 1994 . out all movies released 1n 94 this one wouldnt even make my top 20 . nobodys fool , quiz show , lion king , list goes . only reason i would give it props for(at time ) special effects , which now dated . after gump zemekis directed episode tales crypt where he used same technology easiest worst episode year . i used huge zemekis fan . used cars , romancing stone , back furture movies death becomes her i thought strong movies . but arounf back future 2 i thought zemekis started rely much special effects it shows this film . objective viewer re-watch this film think every scene try remember where you seen scene before . i guarantee you after you you see this movie totally different light	-1

not following recent broadway scene very much , i wasn't really aware what sensation " rent " several years ago when it debuted . i became more aware it when it satirized southpark picture " team america " after my church intergenerational choir sang show " theme " song " seasons love " . then one kids i worked local musical said rent one his favorites , so i first-weekend attendee theatre . story important it depicts gays , lesbians , drag queens drug addicts real people struggling life , love ( aids ) just like so-called " normal " people . rock style , songs aren't necessarily " toe-tappers " you end up whistling way out theatre ( though " seasons love " comes close , particularly if you've sang it least two dozen times , " la vie boheme " showstopper -- plot supposedly based opera name ) , but overall music very exciting integral story . cast moved almost en masse broadway hollywood -- wilson heredia , tony winner drag queen angel , should contended oscar supporting actor . i've read there some concern mainstream hollywood director chris columbus ( home alone , harry potter i ii ) getting job , but i don't see picture suffered it -- maybe some unconvincing special effects worst it . rock opera , it takes some time get used almost all dialogue sung rather than spoken . overall solid four star film ---- definitely recommended fans modern musicals , those marginalized communities , those art their soul s.p.s. afterwards i got hooked soundtrack cd few weeks ( months ? ) but that review	-1

" shaun " supposed comedic ' spoof ' ' homage ' " zombie movie " . it accomplished more . while comedy wryly british , it still funny - social comment universal civilized society ( cased you missed it - we're all zombies already ) . just fun movie , start finish - warned there gratuitous ' gore ' scenes necessary it zombie film , but they few , fast over . there lot ' quick-wit ' humor - newscaster comments end , " i never thought i'd say ... " example . strip away humor homage , there actually much tighter plot than many movies . there not many loose threads - " how zombie get ? " - go back three scenes oh , ed habitually leaves front door open ... impressed attention those kind details . it billed " romantic comedy zombies " - it delivers .	-1
going into movie i didn't know what really expect , but name like shaun white , terje , farmer mix it good any manner . but movie went above beyond what i expected . shots throughout entire film astounding refreshingly clear . history snowboarding there well og who started it all , this probably most well rounded pu t-t ogehter film snowboarding it breif exciting history .	1
van fans , this real deal . incredible performance van exceptional band . horn section pee wee ellis mark isham worth price alone . this might best $15 i ever spent . i would spent $150 if i . most us probably never get chance see van live setting like this but thankfully we these videos posterity . my comments 1980 performance	1
violent anyone ! this movie horrible . cast good , but plot stinks ! its just this family who super powers . then this kid wanted mr. incredibles side kick . ( way) mr. incredible says no so then he hates him . then kid turns evil kills people , wants every body like him . thats origanal . there barely any jokes you laugh once every 20 minutes , there way much violence . killing , guns , punching , bombs , they say stupid words sometimes . i not like person who directed this film because he should not like violence . so i not recommend this movie anyone . especially 2 disc special edition !	-1
i admit it . i bought this one because i think sandra bullock beautiful she looked nice box . i need not bothered . she very minor character minimal screen time . she well her few moments but not enough make this " good show " . story revolves around madison avenue type who thinks he divine mission found new religion . he sets hsi task all market research tools his disposal manages fleece his flock much their disposable income . near end , he begins see light reforms himself . there few brief moments laughter , few moments sandra briefs but redeeming moments all too brief	-1

everyone thinks this movie anthony hopkins living out some demented " gorillas mist " nightmare . simply catalyst teaching us something how we relate world around us . everything this movie control , desire control those who not like us , desire guards control population , desire gooding character contol hopkins . but , what hopkins teach us we not control , but we simply hold onto our illusions control . when our illusions threatened we become angry frightened because we afraid reality . ever wonder why we so disturbed home invasion ? it because someone came , or because we built up illusion we safe , now illusion gone ? this movie look past gorillas corny guards predictable plot , look deeper into what characters reveal ourselves . truly , then this very frightening movie	1
house perfect marriage great character brilliant actor -i can't imagine anyone else role but hugh laurie , he nothing short spectacular . he not only play comedy , but drama , while speaking accent that vastly different his own , while reciting complex medical terminology , while walking limp , cane . they should just hand him best actor emmy every year , because no one else even come close what this man brings every episode . i late party , not finding house until middle season two , but i more than made up it . i never bought any television series dvd before this . i both seasons dvd watched episodes over over again . i watch least one episode every day or i start withdrawal symptoms . great storylines superb cast make this must see show . all i say hugh da man	1

i seen almost all anime offer , but this best . yoko kano , music directer , one , if not , best world . plot gets very depth . you get know all charecters such kiba , toboe , tsume , hige , blue , cheza , all great depth . no matter how many times i see it , it doesn't get old . but after you see end series you never look charecters same way . series takes place apacaliptic age , all world turmoil . only wolves find paradise , rakuen . wolves create illusion human figure protect their identity , but some people see through disguise such nobles . thats where it all starts . actual animation best , detail background folds cloths , it well drawn boot . this anime anyone , men , women , teenagers , pets , anyone over thirteen . this my utmost recamendation all anime . i recomend seeing it japanese	1
movie very good . i enjoyed it so my students . it difficult trying explain my children it ok movie different book . although they enjoyed movie , they bit critical because they felt many important parts missing . overall , it very educational movie . however , i recommend you read book before watching movie . thanks ..	-1
personally , i can't see this movie dust . fact , i find it extremely annoying . only video worse than this one " monty python holy grail . " yecch ! napoleon dynamite , no offense actor , literally puts me sleep . i don't mind his friend pedro , i also don't mind his brother ( dude glasses ) or his grandmother , or even his irksome uncle , but napoleon himself dull dishwater . if they'd only take his character out , i'd probably enjoy this movie little better .	-1
it great see film demonstrates ingenuity artists . ed harris stars directs this portrait famous painter who struggled innovation booze create some most ground-breaking art picasso warhol . portrait details . especially his artist wife , lee krasner ( marcia gay harden ) believed him enough put up his sporadic abuse alcohol . his biological family believed basics hardly embraced his profession or his genius . but nothing seemed like enough him , either . passionate fascinating , ' pollock ' more than paint-by-numbers work life art genius	1

ok ... 200 reviews this movie . yeah .. tarantino good ; elmore leonard great . but jackie brown stolen . it belongs grier forrestor . i no doubt tarantino excellent job directing . but this not his film it not follow up pulp fiction ! grier jackie brown her thing ... tarantino nor s.l. jackson steal her fire . jackie like screen burn . this her movie ... then surprisingly , out nowhere comes forrestor max cherry , hard-boiled but bald spot no hipster quality whatsover . this contrasts well s.l. jackson almost freaky soul brutha halloween costume . max tough , dealing bail jumpers . but he looks like regular shmo , quality enforced immediately when he meets jackie , who , you see , not looking her best . jackie stands out one most dynamic characters i've seen movie , it shame she got no props it . she switches polite tough , desperate determined , white-polite jive-alive , serious seductive ; all this bat eyelash . she cool cool -- booyah ! -- sexy sexy . halle berry go swing monkey bars . most us youngsters not seen this actress . no this not remind me foxie brown . it reminds me more reaction rita hayworth gets shawshank redemption when she appears flips up her hair . everyone cheers . music -- i think tarantino deserves cred here -- adds quite bit emotion characters . this movie , you get course soul 101 but also how music create mood let actor play off it . good summary this chemical reaction how it hits max while driving back work . he pops tape delphonics , somewhat obscure philly soul band . his excitement mirrors ours . earlier , he watched jackie light smoke play lp same band after stint prison . she sways relief , not overtly seductive , but enthusiasm seems missing cherry many our lives . i hate call this film underrated because then it puts it competition tarantino movies i suppose leonard adaptations . we should look it through different lens . which leads me spoiler ....... below ----- i want give respect tarantino or pam forrestor or whoever last scene which max jackie kiss . normally -- thank you hollywood -- black woman kissing white man intimately would awkward . passionate , crazy ok . but intimate no . gotta go out date end movie . kissing scene end completely natural says something . what it say ? i suppose , me part interracial couple , it shows we aren't used seeing this screen . or else director , actor , actress damn good ? i dunno ! gabriel elias	1
first i wondered this particular pairing bert i . gordon classics but when i realized both movies involve giant menaces eliminated same way it became clear . first we earth vs . spider ( often listed tv spider ) . here small town witnesses battles giant spider lives nearby cave . it take while town realize what going first witnesses kids . but soon hunt town mobilizes eliminate giant arachnid . no explanation ever given during movie creature great size . i often wonder if there tentative plans sequel . whatever case , this wonder film giant menaces . unlike similar films , there no delay seeing monster it gets plenty screen time . war colossal beast second feature sequel amazing colossal man . colossal man though perished when he fell huge dam end first movie . but here we quickly discover he alive if not well preying upon food trucks sustenance . he eventually captured folks first film try communicate him bring him back sanity . but giant disfigured man beyond hope or he redeemed scientists or love his sister ? only watching film answer questions . there one odd bit where film suddenly goes black white color right near end . while i would liked double feature two colossal man films two selected this disk go well together . disk lack anything ib way special features but separate menus each film . both films one side disk so there no need flip it over . if you like classic giant menace movies then this definitely one watch	-1
here we what one most mind bogglingly boring movies ever made ! i couldn't believe what i watching ! moreover , i am aghast this film garnered some acclaim some reviewers these pages even saw fit award this dreck unbelievable four five star rating . what going ? it me or them totally lost plot what movies supposed all ? am i naive think movies should first foremost entertain ? where oh where entertainment this lame effort film its unsteady shaky comera work , hamfisted confusing screenplay cloying performance modern cinema most tedious overratedsleep inducing actor ralph fiennes ? how i long good old days when we great movies great actors great writers great directors which achieved what they set out - entertain . sadly emergence such travesty " constant gardener " it appears we unfortunate " real " film lovers dismal viewing future .	-1

i'm glad i didn't let any negative review sway me getting this disc . while ae biography " feel good " story this legend , this disc much more honest it portrayal johhny . they don't hide fact he two sides , w.c. holland , brother tommy cash recall great detail what fully human man black really . narrator fine , re-enactments minimal , needed tell types true stories these wild boys went through . it doesn't take anything away story . disc doesn't focus his music so much ( there no full songs presented ) , man he . that ok ; i enough john music compensate . i love guy even more now then before . no sugar coating ; just like johnny would've wanted it .	1
great movie , great actors such sad part u.s. history ! it great see this movie some men who really existed ( especially " stonewall " jackson ) . we don't know if personalities showed into movie really like this or if it pure fiction , but end day it not very important , because historical interest preserved	1
wands ready ! daniel radcliffe takes up role mysterious boy wizard harry potter j.k. rowling epic seven part fantasy series . fans all ages going crazy ever since they heard rowling popular series going transfigured , so speak , into film showed movie screens around world . yet what makes this movie so unique it not derived modern video game or television series , younger generation seems enjoy , but ancient form entertainment . book ! just what magic held within those pages , seemed hooked readers into its compelling storyline around world ? harry potter sorcerer stone filled plenty excitement . screenplay wonderfully interpreted rowling complex storyline introduces harry potter realm ; actors actresses portray believable , memorable characters , every scene filled spectacular special effects . i find it only fair this movie truly piece magic itself . harry potter sorcerer stone first compelling seven-story adventure where one night living his aunt uncle somewhat abused life , eleven-year-old harry potter ( daniel radcliffe ) learns he wizard gets shipped off hogwarts school witchcraft wizardry learn art magic . his arrival he befriends ron weasley ( rupert grint ) insufferable know it all hermione granger ( emma watson ) , course there deadly enemy main character always makes , draco malfoy ( tom felton ) . harry potter brought many trials cloisters learning art magic his many teachers like professor mcgonagall ( maggie smith ) " greasy git " professor snape ( alan rickman ) , all while praised highly greatest wizard world , albus dumbledore ( richard harris ) taken under large wing half-giant gamekeeper rubeus hagrid ( robbie coltrane ) . what makes this story more compelling harry potter himself hero , hero defeating dark wizard name lord voldemort ( craftily computer generation ) . now lord voldemort after precious stone make him immortal , harry his friends only ones who stop him . harry potter sorcerers stone , filled action packed scenes digitally enhanced wonders technology three-headed dog miniature dragon . some best scenes include quidditch scene where harry partakes his first quidditch match , devil snare scene where harry , ron hermione find themselves choked plant , finally troll scene where harry ron save hermione ghastly looking , mold covered troll . these digital enhancements polish gems movie perfectly make them shine outstanding brightness , they really give movie magical aspect . setting also strong point found within movie . most places match ones described book perfectly . they create such vivid image mind , it almost makes you think it what you seeing real . hogwarts castle depicted almost perfectly it towering roofs warmly lit windows . corridors lit torches floating candles while potions classroom looks dark grimy . grounds beautiful , flourishing spring magic . every aspect craftily make movie real book possible . movie also some shortcomings well . it two half hours long , you figure they'd put important parts . however , this not case . most time , important parts lead next event cut out rearranged make story better movie audience . other aspects film , harry portrayed unrealistically boy wizard who defeated dark lord age six months now greatest wizard all time ? moment harry enters hogwarts he becomes hero even though he didn't anything . most harry life he didn't even know his great feat against dark lord , within days hogwarts he flaunting his unique lightning bolt scar like he knew one day he would become hero . he then takes responsibility saving entire school dark powers without question . i'd expect eleven-year-old boy would scared just like every other young kid who threatened death . harry potter , all glory it received , some competition . i firmly believe harry potter sorcerers stone fell directly fans tolkien lord rings c.s. lewis ' chronicles narnia , both which came out their own movie . firm christians sought out narnia , while hardcore fantasy fans fled lord rings , leaving harry potter middle . however there some hardcore harry potter fans well , but when rowling epic story ends , this brilliant story just fade or fall into shadows films become classics . even though movie both very strong points it shortcomings , it still overall great film . first epic seven part series , this movie ends happy ending , but lot questions unanswered . there both good bad side this . many fans can't stand waiting next film produced year or so , but if you get them hooked enough , you guarantee they'll back next one . harry potter sorcerer stone movie made family viewing . it depicts life wizard how he copes new world . it also firmly implies important lessons courage loyalty those you care . now , there total six books four harry potter movies , all which hit record amounts . fans j.k. rowling masterpiece anxiously awaiting closure her series final book . i suggest until happens , fans occupy themselves watching magic harry potter films majestic moral themes they present . this reveiw katelynn mallonrabbid harry potter fangir	1

exception disc# 6 this collection very disappointing . it obvious show lost its charm after season #3 well its way out before paul reubens little incident . however , if you liked pee-wee herman first collection under playhouse #1 excellent . it fresh innovative . my 3 year old loves first 6 discs . disc #7 disc #10 actually pretty bad not worth purchase . they should included disc #6 first set . anything after simply not entertaining . quality all discs still excellent .	-1
this definitely b-movie , so don't expect great acting or special effects , but boy , it hunky guys showing off their glistening bodies much possible . imagine movie starring bunch abercrombie fitch models ... imagine acting caliber said models . only thing really bothered me ridiculous annoying " special effect " used whenever leeches attacked someone . but , now it available really low price , it even more worth it if you like campy , brainless fun . this one those flix you would rate " 1 star " if your reference point normal hollywood blockbuster , but genre it , this definitely great addition	-1
i'm average shape frequently exercise home . i used minna fat eliminator workout while enjoyed her style , so i decided give " emergency " workout shot . i just got it this week entire video twice . 30-minute toning portion great . she combines arms legs so you work up sweat . she very thorough , covering all arm muscles fatiguing legs well . i wish she spent little more time abs , but that my only complaint . 30-minute cardio routine fun , but it take few times get moves down , including mambos , cha chas , hip shakes , other salsa-type moves . it requires some concentration which fine me , because it makes workout go quicker . i haven't sweated much i fat eliminator workout , but i attest fact i'm still getting used moves . once i become more familiar routine , i'm hoping increase my own intensity work up better sweat . overall , this fun cardio toning program . i highly recommend anyone who looking " dancey " workout .	-1
i can't believe i'm saying this ..... it great movie ! my wife wanted see this movie forced me sit there watch it . i'm glad she ! look i'm not saying this life beautiful but what it it dam good ! bosworth shines radiantly ( unlike beyond sea disaster ) . duhammel steals every scene he . ginnifer goodwin outstanding what supposed flunky role . she turns it around memorable lighthearted sidekick bosworth . she extremely attractive boot ! kind like jennifer tilly whole lot more class without irritating baby voice . mr. tophar ..... well ..... i find him bit grating ..... sorry . i would preferred somebody like toby mcguire but not enough dimminish this fine piece fluff . so yourself favor buy it . i'm sure you'll want see it over over again . winner	1

this one those classic romantic dramas manages get you old-fashioned , hollywood way . audrey hepburn holly golightly , playgirl escort trying marry into money . george peppard paul varjak , struggling writer " supported " older woman . film follows pair they get know each other , accept their feelings , deal their lot life . objectively , there not much plot . we jump around holly paul life , treated some startling revelations holly past her current dealings . it feels disjointed , even somewhat hard believe times . but really , what you're here audrey hepburn . she captivates . she shines . she enchants . i instantly fell love her when i saw this film . simply put , audrey made me believe happy endings again . there lot said . paramount so-so job this anniversary edition dvd . there commentary few tidbits supplements , but you end up feeling so much more could've said . whatever . breakfast tiffanys schmaltzy hollywood romance right . buy it , love it , get swept up holly golightly all over again .	1

i saw " annie get your gun " again this weekend live stage . i forgotten just how many great songs irving berlin wrote this masterpiece ! --" you can't get man gun " , " girl i marry " , " doin ' what comes naturally , " " anything you i better , " " they say falling love wonderful , " " i got sun morning moon night , " classic anthem " there no business like show business . " if you haven't seen or heard this musical , please yourself favor get this film tape or dvd . afterthoughts : i just read several negative reviews betty hutton portrayal annie oakley . not believe them . not even read them ! some people " glass half empty " type people negativity contagious ! betty hutton portrayal , course , probably directed director film . so it " director portrayal " ; director responsible what betty hutton screen . , this not meant " realistic " portrayal " real " person anyway --- no one alive remembers what annie oakley really like . so portrayal betty hutton ( directed her director ) good " shot it " any other --- including judy garland portrayal . so , i suggest you just accept betty huttons portrayal " one among many possible " enjoy what portrayal --- alot comedic verve vivacity ! yes , " glass half full " .. even more than half .... this case . then there some reviewers who criticize show because annie pretends poorer shot than frank near end " get her man " letting him win thus showing his " shooting prowess " some respect make him feel better . i suppose some people it " politically incorrect " " play male ego game " . but , isn't " playing male ego game " what it takes sometimes " get man you want ? " so , wasn't annie play just " realistic " ? isn't criticizing this aspect play " nit-picking " . ask yourself , could you even come close writing " masterpiece " like musical , " annie get your gun " ? if you couldn't it , then what gives you right " nit pic " show ? indian issue . some people feel indians disrespected show . but , show i saw chief sitting bull portrayed giving good advice annie intelligent person . my opinion , whichever way indians portrayed movie doesn't change anything all positive aspects show . my suggestion forget all nit-picking enjoy show ! there alot enjoy ! :o ) email boland7214 @aol .	1

i saw this recently lark just see what all brigitte bardot fuss -- wasn't expecting much since sex comedy farces ( particularly french ones ) aren't high my film watch lists -- but surprised how good ( good-natured ) it . besides vivacious charms ms. bardot , this film solid script good acting dialogs . ( one my favorite lines bardot replying query why family won't sell its puny shipyard effect they want least still * own * something not feel poor . ) story not highbrow , but far lowbrow tawdry exploitative some newcomers ( like me ) might perceive its notorious reputation . bardot plays juliette , " town tramp " st. tropez who pursued rich , elderly playboy while carrying torch antonio , impecunious shipwright who treats her just convenient one-night-stand . comes antonio younger brother , michele , who truly loves her offers marry her save her sent back orphanage . juliette marries michele comes love him despite herself , while fighting against her reckless , impetuous nature antonio comes back into scene presents constant temptation . love or lust wins out ? call me old-fashioned , but i liked how movie ends , i agree amazon reviewer analysis ( robert cartland ) , which hits it square head . ( btw , video transfer this criterion dvd edition excellent , eliminating all old flaws while preserving warm , vibrant colors st. tropez location great effect . )	-1

i thought i taking risk buying this dvd because there not much info it . after watching full dvd , i'm glad i took risk . this dvd pleasant surprise ! well worth money i spent . dvd split into 3 main sections : tools techniques , then artistic principles , last one complete animation example start finish . first 2 sections 1 1/2 hours each while last one hour . watching tools techniques section , i little worried because dvd uses animation master i use maya . i thought it would hard follow , but i glad know tools animation master pretty much same maya . they similar bones , ik , fk , dope sheet , graph editor . way he teaches tools more like how use tools , not which button push menu . example he showed how use dope sheet graph editor correctly structured way so your animations easy change if need . after watching this , i liked he taught it this way instead " click here here " , because you really get sense how why certain things animation . there lots small examples spread out through first part . now this where i found dvd most helpful . i read lots books animation , but never really ' got it ' just reading . seeing examples full motion really helps out lot . second section all animation art . he talked principles like squash stretch , weight , staging , keyframing , secondary action . too many list right now . each little chapter lots examples showing you how animate principle correctly . i loved fact he showed lots common mistakes then how fix them . this section really where you learn how make your animations look good it pretty entertaining . oh yeah , entertainment factor also big plus . i watched through this 4 hr dvd one sitting , which no small feat ! they used lots different footage their examples , which i thought keeps it fresh active . i've seen other 3d training videos just computer screen guy talking , that all you see . if you think sounds boring , well it . this dvd different they teacher basically talking audience then they would cut animation examples or computer screen further illustrate what teacher saying . music cool too . one thing bug me little sound . background hiss pretty high , which annoying , but you could still easily hear everything clearly . it just wasn't dvd quality audio though . last section dvd full animation example concept finally rendering . i enjoyed this part lot , because i got see how professional animator animates . he not only tells you what he doing , but also his mental critiques animation also what he planning next . when mistakes happens , he told you how fix them . if everything before this section theory , then this section practical . all all , great dvd learn . i know i re-watching this one few times	1
mamoru oshii outstanding ghost shell ( 1995 ) , director/writer gave himself little time , less than 90 minutes , explore many questions he raised script . his long-awaited sequel , ghost shell 2 : innocence , he succeeds answering many these questions whilst same time giving us many more ponder , film , though flawed , deserves 5 star rating . rather like disney animation , film viewed more than one level more than one audience . surface it sumptuously-animated film which fairly conventional who-done-it plot unfolds ; robots murdering humans , crime specialist brought solve case . period . we already seen equivalent plots films such blade runner or i , robot this film nothing new add basic idea . however oshii world far more disturbing complex below surface . he subverts ending film which , could taken triumph good over evil . however , when distinctions robot human become blurred central notions good evil film fall down . he pulls other tricks undermine our assumptions humanity ; one point main cop character puts coat over robot hide its nakedness ; time robotic character philosophises over meaning existence , whilst chain-smoking . it director treatment paradox what it means human film value lies , not superficial plot . characterisation little scimpy ( notable exception depiction oshii own basset hound , which drawn clear devotion ) but visually film stunning . oshii one few directors able practice delicate art inactivity screen . he not scared abandon plot minutes end luxuriate , example , extended arial shot city , or dwell completely motionless face whilst we register its owner emotional state , or allow his main characters , motionless screen what seems like ages , quote western philosophical religious texts . none these scenes moves plot forwards yet film would immeasurably poorer without them . too many sequels outstanding films try provide glib answers issues raised original most fail this approach ; examples such 2010 matrix reloaded spring mind . this film oshii avoided this pitfall given us rare sequal , takes theme original finds something fresh say . summary , film deserves 5 star rating , but i think it falls short greatness .	1

glory truly extraordinary motion picture all sorts ways . proud southerner , i say no other film ever me cheering union regiment taking company confederate soldiers . i little worried this film would demonize south , but it proved most even-handed treatment all parties . demonstrating racism northerners - soldiers civilians alike - it paints most nuanced portrait african-american men who seized opportunity don blue uniforms fight country many them must unable truly call their own . only makes their heroism bravery all more poignant . war states never understood simple black white terms any level , many union soldier clearly wasn't fighting emancipate slaves ( just many rebel soldier wasn't fighting slavery ) . even when they actually used teach actual history schools , story 54th massachusetts regiment subject never really came up - what gives glory such extraordinary amount historical importance . i wouldn't go so far say heroism sacrifice this first african-american regiment union army turned tide war , but it lead acceptance actual black fighting soldiers union ranks - 210,000 such recruits certainly proved important fighting force basically won through strength numbers ( more blues than grays died war ) . movie itself , though , really men who led made up 54th massachusetts regiment - there sterling performances all over place . i said many times past , morgan freeman best actor living today , his character , sgt . major john rawlins , really heart soul whole film . older , runaway slave , he gained measure wisdom restraint private trip ( denzel washington ) never even imagined . trip wears scars his back proudly , he not stand down before any man . washington earned best supporting actor award his role , rightly so . educated freemen represented thomas searles ( andre braugher ) , who seems ill-suited harsh realities war but shoulders burden pride determination . head these men rides colonel robert gould shaw ( matthew broderick ) , young officer who secured position more family influence than merit , perhaps , but he more than rises challenge fight both his men . despite his lifelong friendship thomas , he almost no connection men 54th must learn know them earn their respect . union army doesn't even want supply his men necessities such decent shoes uniform , nor it really any intention actually sending them into combat . thanks colonel , though , fighting men 54th eventually get their chance prove themselves leading what basically suicidal charge against fort wagner south carolina . aside multi-layered story itself , one must impressed realism action . war ugly business , fact brought home very first scenes showing colonel shaw charge during battle antietam . while there should small rivers blood covering battlefield , watching soldier head basically explode makes vivid stamp realism . while i would question tactics employed assault fort wayne end , movie certainly capture nature fog war viciousness hand-to-hand fighting heroes both sides . course , this movie , so there numerous historical inaccuracies main characters ( none whom , other than col . shaw , based actual soldiers ) battles , yet glory certainly succeed telling story 54th regiment most compelling ways	1
one man life full ups downs pictured film , " throne blood " , directed akira kurosawa . this film japanese re-make version famous shakespearean play , macbeth . because this film japanese film , many details differ macbeth , although basic plot story same . all plot changes , character setting differences effective choices this film because it adds different taste original form story . most plot changes film due cultural differences make plot this film natural flowing , little twist end . some detailed plot adaptations director make included washizu ( playing role macbeth ) taking over cob-web castle , miki ( playing role lady macbeth ) pregnant washizu killed his own men towards end story . medieval japan , man taking over castle not necessarily mean he emperor japan , unlike macbeth aiming king start . therefore , washizu not kill emperor , but he kill others competing castle . however , conflicts washizu other competent similar macbeth because goal they both mind achieve power . this film , miki pregnancy not seem dramatical change plot story , but thought necessary this japanese film . reason this because couple wanted their own child inherit his throne after his death . this inheriting system similar one macbeth , but this director decided add this detail reveal great desires washizu . after all killing struggles take over castle , washizu not want any other person but his child who shares his blood inherit throne . climax this film comes when hundreds soldiers washizu side points their arrows him one one hits him . this plot adaptations made this film because soldiers wanted show sign surrender . giving washizu head represented surrender . this change made film more violent thus added twist unexpected ending . making changes , it very important plot flows it natural . this sort change needed because there no fun film or story completely same original form . main character , washizu very different characteristic macbeth . washizu brave , confident , demanding more selfish than shakespearean macbeth . shogun ( similar position thane when referring macbeth ) strong , determined brave take over castle . unlike macbeth , he demanding his wife tone his speech overall strong . director probably wanted express image brave man going through one straight road towards his goal , but ending tragic death . this maybe typical image shogun during medieval japan . one thing not expressed because this characterization washizu , gradual change washizu beginning end story . this important change express because macbeth , he growing become more aggressive greedy he overcomes obstacles become king . similarly , miki characterization different form lady macbeth too . lady macbeth pretty strong woman , telling her husband what . however , miki not like her because she under circumstance where she cannot , since washizu demanding person . but overall , two characters played japanese actors very well suited this version macbeth . " throne blood " set medieval japan , when shoguns each castle fought prove strongest castle warlords . this setting very suited fit story like macbeth into . both setting lords , emperor/king , warriors . this made it possible details expressed film . example one detail one three apparitions old lady , gave washizu . when old lady told him he victorious unless wood nears neighbor comes down washizu castle . since medieval castle japan constructed top fort used forests woods one protection security methods , this apparition realistic . director chose japan setting this film , probably because many things matched original setting . technically , it completely different setting but it good enough reproduce similar story which very impressive . if people who never seen or heard macbeth happens see " throne blood " not think this film reproductive shakespearean play . this how almost perfectly macbeth throne blood matches . changes made rather improve film . washizu macbeth , both who lived fast tragic life possess lifestyle people today still learn achieve . power films stories . " throne blood " always classical perfect example successful reproductive film .	1

this movie quiet , subtle . funny heartbreaking . moving frightening . many ways it surpasses " sixth sense " me shyamalan truly " great " film , simply because i grew love this family , identify them . it shame next two films shyamalan released so incredibly frustratingly sub-par . but here , he shines , telling modern day story not-so-little green men coming earth , not friendly way . he very easily could failed here , this could turned into cheesy , b-movie , but he makes you believe . hopefully he again one day	1
keeping my usual habit discovering thinks backwards i managed view second eye film before first , but i'm reassured excellent ' making ' extra director danny pang set out make film completely disconnected first . other than theme it through our eyes we meet dead , course . joey ( qi shu ) young woman who , face failed romance , falls apart emotionally . attempt suicide unexpected side effect allowing her see ghostly figures spirits world around her . when joey discovers she pregnant lover who abandoned her , second piece puzzle falls into place , these spirits dead , waiting enter bodies infants they born . joey terrified , defensive her own unborn child . even efforts buddhist priest fail convince her this anything but hideous , unexpected curse . she keeps searching answers , but finds no comfort her discoveries . she confronted ironic twist fate come very near destroying her completely . pang brothers manage avoid various clichs ghost stories , making various spirit appearances blend right into steadily rising tension film . qi shu manages stay just this side over acting , general atmosphere film naturalistic . this lack theatricality adds unexpected reality qi shu performance , enhances anguish confusion supporting cast members like jesdaporn pholdee . altogether enjoyable effort almost level tale two sisters	-1

rather than give general review others kindly , my review focuses one aspect film , indeed one character , martha . martha dunstock known throughout film martha dumptruck . even film credits include nickname `dumptruck ' besides character surname ( evidently feeling need labour point ) . portrayed unattractive pathetically grateful any attention she given , she unwittingly provides slater character information enabling him murder student . later , when cult status `suicides ' ( , murdered students ) becomes apparent , martha attempts her own suicide walking into path traffic . but her attempt shown failure . end film martha bruised now disabled , electric wheelchair . ryder character , finished her voyage self-realisation , rejects school prom night instead invites martha stay video popcorn . martha gratefully accepts closing scenes show ryder walking corridor while martha encircles her like planet around sun . image martha her wheelchair , object pity ryder audience , signifies us fears different , not beautiful , not loved respected . martha person we all frightened becoming . she given no means solving her predicament film maker . though some us audience may fat , or disabled , or both , we may yet still fear martha , invited consider ryder protagonist journey self discovery our own , even physical social reality , we more like martha . this reason , `heathers ' fails exploration `hell ' high school ( description often used buffy/angel/ firefly joss whedon ) . those audience not thin complying western standards `beauty ' protagonists ( probably majority us ) ultimately may find so-called subversion cruel hierarchy this film just little too shallow , leaving bitter after-taste . way `fat ' people portrayed films such these unfortunately often reflect predictable , transparent absurd fixations film makers . sadly this happening even today - some ways it gotten even worse since western world decided wage ' war fat ' ( quote paul campos ) - even best it lazy film-making .	-1

there little say this movie , since i assume people interested buying this item already seen it already . but amount quality extras this dvd just breathtaking . say least , disc 2 imax version film , which time this writing not documented here amazon . imax version , well :) , shorter version film ( 1h55 ' versus 2h20 ' regular ) aspect ratio 1:66 . so if you unsure buy widescreen or fullscreen versions , i suggest buying wide , since you get ( sort ) full screen version imax one present disc 2 . then there this documentary " conquest space " which rather dull , " astronauts story " very short but interesting clip , excellent " making " juicy commentary jim lovell , pinpointing hits misses film compared real thing . $9.90 , how you not buy this jewel	1

i am huge fan wes anderson debut effort , " rushmore . " it one most original , well-written , soulful comedies teenage life ( our inability grow beyond it ) i'd ever seen . " rushmore " also great cast , led perhaps my favorite actor all time , bill murray . but then came follow-up , " royal tennenbaums , " bill murray there once again . it not coincidence " tennenbaums " not same class " rushmore " either comedy or film , it also put murray off one side , barely using him . one left speculate possibilities anderson murray teaming up where murray got spotlight 100% time . those speculations brought fruition " life aquatic steve zissou , " things generally what you would expect this team . " life aquatic " looks sounds just like movie one would expect max fisher , hero " rushmore . " it low-budget , slap-dash affair ( watch hilariously-amateurish gunfight scenes ) whimsical special effects ludicrous stabs tragedy . but blasting thing got heart , its heart melancholy , bemused visage bill murray . murray plays titular steve zissou , minor-league jacques cousteau whose best years both behind him not all great . murray captures zissou man looking into abyss his own mortality his own futility elan only he could muster . murray says more sidelong glance than many actors evoke soliloquy , fans this long-time great , " life aquatic " offers many sterling moments . but rest movie , all its heart imagination , not exceed sum its parts . it funny traditional wes anderson way , populated people who no idea how pathetic they really . there lines brilliant comedy insight . but just like aaron sorkin dialogue " few good men " " american president " " west wing " sounds exactly same regardless who speaking lines , wes anderson motif starting wear bit thin . particularly tiresome owen wilson kentucky air pilot , whose southern-ness seems play no role except wilson fulfill some outmoded stereotypes . willem dafoe , god bless him , shoots moon his german side-kick , but he brings rage intensity movie where rest cast seems so mellow you believe they more than little " baked , " so he often seems coming different movie altogether . if you love bill murray , or wes anderson , you love " life aquatic . " much big fan i am murray , i still can't rave movie . but it definitely worth your time , if only see magical wonder jaguar shark . see draw unparalled pleasure seeing jeff goldblum get shot	-1

disney remake " mighty joe young " excellent film , but nothing beats charm original film . said , i think both versions worth owning . there common thread runs through both original this remake , both share somewhat similar climatic ending . but there enough differences make two films unique quite interesting side-by-side comparisons . course disney version you state-of-the art cgi . joe looks so real , it blow your mind ! sweet tearjerker whole family enjoy . remake mjy filmed color widescreen . original " mighty joe young " you don't get state-of-the-art special effects remake , but what you get much better story which tugs all your emotions . climax film very exciting , so touching it brings tears eyes . i won't give it away not spoil it . original mjy filmed black white full screen . great news , this film finally released november 2005 original " king kong " " son kong " special collection . it most likely available single dvd well . it should winner !	1

i quite liked this movie . it isn't ever going absolute favourite mine , but it very entertaining because it good mix it comedy , drama , revenge , passion good old fun . kimberly elise ok this ( i think it would suited either angela bassat or vivica fox better ) her deliciously evil husband ( steve harris - practice heist ) excellent . he so mean you knew he'd get what coming him he sure . he just lucky his soon-to-be-ex wife so kind him inspite what he'd previously her . kimberly character make right choice end ( very predictable ) it very officer gentleman end . take cake tyler perry . he so funny - even i white chick get his humour his delivery . i especially love scene new girlfriends closet . hilarious . this really good movie should wide appeal because it got everything it . there big lesson learn it it also entertain you again again . i highly recommend it	-1
i like gangster movies am philly so i gave this movie chance . what mistake . creators painstakingly tried rip off sopranos but wound up very weak imitation . it starts horrible theme song . it obviously trying sound similar a3 song serves sopranos theme , but chock full horrible lyrics sounds like someone threw casio keyboard down stairs recorded i t.t he cast filled mediocre actors , trying vain save stupid script . one funny thing everyone film different accent , exception one guy , no one south philly accent . sal mazzotta trying real hard james gandolfini tony soprano , but i'm sorry ... he may nice guy real life , but guy couldn't act scared graveyard midnight . come ; this guy gangster ? maybe lurch adams family . this movie also plauged choppy editing poor camera work . i mean few scenes camera actually going out focus while people talking . don't they teach film school ? usually when two people talking their heads turned one angle wide two person shot , completely different angles close ups , like maybe close up stuff much later . save your money . wish i could get mine back . it long time since i saw movie so bad i felt angry ripped off seen it .	-1

this wishy washy attempt truth . facts there parts pieces , but it not really put together well . some choices material questionable truly valuable topic . this dvd agenda not unbiased , i think it failed it overall agenda . there more than enough information pre-9/11 post-9/11 put together something more worthy accurate than this dvd attempted . if this best contrasting evidence bush administration produced after all happened white house beyond , we truly trouble . truth out there , i think this dvd tripped over them kept walking without looking down gathering all facts together . there plenty important facts things said worth listening this dvd , but this dvd maybe worth glance , but not long hard look .	-1
tamilee webb 2 dvd set best ! she you working hard without steep learning curve . if you read my other reviews , then you know i hate videos complicated steps or poor instructions . tamilee knows her stuff she shares knowlege you . you learn how each move right way every time . weight loss dvd my favorite , but you should note it requires step . first few times i tried it , my legs felt like jelly afterwards . when i able get through whole workout , there tremendous feeling accomplishment . lower body workout strenuous without exhausting . when i've complete video , i feel energized rather than depleted . tamilee cueing efficient her timing excellent . there only few minor negative points ; music little bland two women who exercising tamilee too perfect seem real . i really appreciate it when workout videos show normal looking people . said , these videos two my favorites . i never seem tire them .	-1

jurassic park : lost world isn't quite bad lot reviewers say , although they certainly entitled their opinions---isn't what this site all ? any rate , while sequel loses some its originality awe-inspiring moments , it well action film , rexs attacking trailer nail-biting sequence . there lot predictability scientists vs . hunters formula , but film like this , one accept predictablility if it handled professionally . effects camera work par excellence . first film , jeff goldblum underplays his role , perhaps bit too much this time --- he almost seems bored ? julianne moore who go more " acting " roles okay heroine , little more exciting than laura dern . i too agree decision go politically correct give goldblum african-american daughter , especially since there no background add this relationship . pete postelthwaite arliss howard villains appropriately cast . while not big hit its prequel , lost world entertained me	-1

regardless how disenchanted one might become its politics , its politicians , or its policies , film like this restores one faith what our country offer its young people . even if you happen think sort ruthless competition goes this film strike against us country , there still something very moving child nationally recognized celebrated size her vocabulary rather than her socio-economic background , social skills , or appearance . place saturated influence beautiful people ( valued often nothing else ) , its refreshing see child braces bad haircut hold up trophy comes up his chest , walk away enough money see him through his first year college . beyond , this movie delightfully nerve-wracking ! suspenseful full surprises , its entertaining it important .	-1

i able comparison swordfish dvd hd-dvd switching one other my tv . dvd colours off . there too much green blue picture not enough red , which made whole movie over saturated those colours gave flesh tones unrealistic look . colour bleeding also evident certain scenes . futhermore , image soft blurred . soundtrack good but seemed lack umph feel it . switching hd-dvd , what difference colours accurate , flesh tones natural there no evidence colour bleeding . image very sharp this sharpness my tv turned completely off . dolby digital plus track bumpin ' . it extremely directional powerful my subwoofer getting good workout . hd-dvd arrived , swordfish great job showing off what hd-dvd	1

so what y'all smoking ? sure , jessica simpson sing ( especially her beginnings 1999 lukewarm smash sweet kisses ) , but not particularly this dvd . she some serious vocal affections hinder her natural sound distort her pop croonings ( she comes off britney wannabe ) . interestingly her more tepid boring tunes this skin sound best ( including " my way home " ) . her rendition " take my breath away " decent , touching " you don't let go " ( her " i love because you love ... me " nothing less than beautiful ) , but her awful performance " angels " falls extremely short expectations ( she sounded much better vh1 divas live ) . end , her reality tour 2004 decent but much less stellar concert given girl who talent . throw out britney-trademarked growl , jessica , odd vocal quirk makes it sound though she choking back song rather than singing it you soar . decent , but not great .	-1
i read one negative review this film i would like clarify statements made it . i am russian so , obviously , i like this film . it typical russian humor , it farce , so not look higher meanings jokes , it makes fun social standards soviet regime well people who served it so well . it features some best russian actors we love seeing acting ; they sing movie it lovely well . if you tough judge movies , then please make sure you know soviet history bit understand humor differs what you see american movies before you call it crap . i not see why there should problem characters not talking first ten minutes movie . fact , it just few minutes during which you shown premise movie . cyrillic letters not making sense : this russian movie you bound see everything written our gibberish alphabet . besides , movie begins cruise foreign country ( it shot baku , azerbajan but supposed turkey ) . language spoken locals well signs buildings gibberish - it made up specially movie . said , i want say few words plot . semen semenovich diligent russian economist goes cruise , where he gets acquainted mafia mob right hand , kozodoev , whose assignment pick up diamonds supplier deliver it back moscow via cast his arm . during one last stops , semen semenovich gets mistaken kozodoev ends up cast jewels inside it . he returns moscow , semen contacts police . now , he pose bait escape traps elaborately planted mafia . i already said , movie fantastic . just remember it farce . no , there not slapstick humour . open-minded enjoy ! oh , way , all jewelry you see screen authentic . it mentioned beginning film crew would like thank all soviet individuals who lend their gems filming .	1
this great cyber thriller sandra bullock excellent job portraying female computer geek . directing , casting , sets , music first class . those us computer industry those who not both enjoy it . i'm senior engineer worked computers twenty plus years i saw it when it first released . when i first saw this movie , only one thing amused me , wolfenstein game , it movies only shortcoming . time movie released game old news they carry how game state art . it didn't ring true those us bleeding edge gaming community . they should not put game or came up something looked high tech since game dates it . perhaps snobbery , but true nonetheless . i said before it only shortcoming . this movie excellent mood like hitchcockian or grisham thriller . well paced it keeps you guessing what next . threat identity theft large computer companies failing because faulty software today only shows how respect movie ahead it time . i never tire watching it . dvd quality good , but unfortunately it not include any extras . still well worth buying copy	-1

grudge american remake japanese horror film . what different grudge it non-linear story line . first you think it three separate stories , then just two , finally you realize your seeing interspersed storylines past present they meet end film -- filling you curse what happening . ( think momento identity)the scariest part story , it pretty creepy , because curse born first murder kills indescriminately anyone who enters house . not immediately . not same way . no matter what you , you can't outwit it . if you house , it got your number . scariest thing most people involved innocent -- they nothing original killing , when seeing ghost while shocked , they tried help . yet , still they died . there might way avoid curse but unfortunately , it didn't get carried ou t.t here no cgi/fx -- everything low key creepy . i'd almost say this more psychological horror than monster coming get you horror but never they less -- you'll probably end up sleeping lights wondering if you should evere go into house you don't know anything again	-1
plenty reviews described this amazing movie . i'd just like add note meaning title . most people ignored it - one reviewer thought it reference frequency shooting up . ( ex ) brit , who grew up scotland , when i saw it , some time ago , i just automatically assumed something quite different . first - trainspotting actual hobby britain . remember this small country dense active rail network . lots people really , really interested trains , but trainspotting kind very lowest-grade interest . trainspotters stand around stations , or major rail junctions , or marshalling yards , just collect train facts - usually engine numbers , sometimes appearances some particular kind rolling stock . all they - make lists ! ( or sometimes trade number lists other spotters , or exult size their list ) . so image trainspotter low-energy person , very conventional outlook , probably standing hours rain shabby raincoat ... one who pretty much given up ever doing anything exciting who absolutely needs get life ! collecting train numbers basically pure , time-consuming obsession . collecting stamps or beer mats or matchbooks , or any thousand other odd things people collect , sometimes dimension - artistic interest , investment , etc - train numbers lead nowhere . so me title " trainspotting " sardonic reminder monotonous , meaningless " normal " life guys rebelling against trying escape - unwisely , but desperately - their drug usage . it background against which vivid certainly scary picture painted . hope this helpful . would interesting hear anyone associated movie if that right - i say , it just natural ., automatic interpretation me . ps - after reading many , many reviews - why it so many otherwise literate people just cannot spell words definite definitely ? many keep thinking there there somewhere ... one even wrote " defiantly " which gave interesting unintended twist , course passed spell-check ... oh well	1

thats all their too it . dick van dyke rocks ! i love this show . i still watch it sometimes i tv . earlier seasons best , dr. jack stewart played jack baio(think thats right)when jesse travis comes , played charlie schlatter(hope thats right)the episodes seem focus more scandals boring politics . they still fun watch , but not fun beginning episodes . you tell cast just great time each scene . oh , michael tucci(that right)is awesome norman briges . all other characters cool too . so buy this whenever it comes out whoever owns rights this series i this say : release rest seasons ! thank you	1

we all knew form previews this movie tom cruse hit man jamie foxx cab driver . , tom commandeers jamie his cab night killing . problem , me when mild-mannered , soft-spoken cab driver turns into macho operative then super hero . max ( jamie foxx ) cab driver twelve years . although he dreams aspirations ; that all they . after twelve years he still cab drive . yet , when he picks up sophisticated lady lawyer , he charms her his quick wit knowledge ; point she gives him her phone without him even asking it . i not buy minute . his next fare vincent ( tom cruse ) . vincent wants hire max cab night willing pay well beyond max usual nigh t-t ime take . yet max resist . ( why ? i don't understand this . ) reluctantly max agrees vincent request but only after vincent really pushes issue . then , everything changes when max -- accident -- finds out vincent killer . , vincent plans killing more people max his wheel man . remember , max mild-mannered , passive type person . so he not only fears his life but he scared out his wits . so , he allows vincent intimidate him into going killing spree . course all not go planned . without giving away plot ( if you call it ) max forced vincent confront some very bad people -- his own . yet , while scared out his wits surrounded gun wheeling henchmen ; max able bluff very bad man putting macho act . i not buy second . after more killings , max still scared but decides vincent must stopped . so , without regard his own life ( anymore ) , max makes all out effort stop vincent . , course , not work . vincent leaves max precarious situation continues go after his next victim . so max , his now obsession stop vincent , overpowers police officer who arresting him , takes police officer gun , goes after vincent stop him . i not buy millisecond . i am glad i not buy this movie .	-1
i saw this movie years ago , but didn't remember much it , except some songs , basic story . i also saw " nights cabiria " , which story taken . i love musicals , i think shirley maclaine very talented . she very sweet charity hope valentine , one can't help wanting happy ending her . so why i think this movie awful ? first all , some dialogue so repetitious it became irritating -- how many times you listen charity say " fickle finger fate " over over without wanting hit mute button ? also , some scenes went -- especially elevator scene . -- intermission totally unnecessary . but worst disappointment me musical numbers . i didn't like any them --- they so far over top silly . bob fosse must thrown everything into them he could --- instead letting dancers songs carry numbers , he so much busyness all them -- too many people , costumes didn't fit story , silly moves -- they all went past point enjoyment . i fast forwarded thrua couple them just get them over . i never before any movie . this could so much better -- story good , charactors good -- but whole thing should toned down . movie could 30 minutes shorter if there some trimming . it entirely too long . also --- all stop action -- what all ? i know , i know -- it show progress story , but it distraction . i didn't like movie glad when it over .	-1
i wholeheartedly agree all glowing reviews this site , this movie probably one most magical i ever seen ( i'm 41 ) . however , pg rating because some coarse language which amazon not mention specifically . i watched it my daughter when she 8 , since i seen movie when it first came out , i couldn't recall exactly what it . well .... it word i believe also g-d , so if you prefer your kids not hear kind language movie you chosen then you might want hold off this one few more years ( although they may hearing those words worse their school bus anyway ) . there also scene where girlfriend comes spend night her shirt gets unbuttoned you see her bra .... so just know depending your child level knowledge sex , etc you may get questions you aren't ready !! anyway my daughter four years older now i would feel much more comfortable watching this her now she " pre-teen " . other than this it terrific movie definitely one most creative tom hanks ' career .	1

there many movies sports , some very good , some really bad this one falls into very good category . " goal ! " typical sports movie exceptionally talented young amateur who given chance shine among professionals win heart girl he loves . however , " goal ! " works this premise makes it fresh entertaining . director danny cannon complete support fifa newcastle united it shows , he created some most realist remarkable football scenes film . kuno becker very good santiago , although times he overshadowed other members cast . it seems if he lacked some presence screen . however , he still young , certainly improve years . alessandro nivola steals movie his performance gavin , notorious football star whose convoluted public life begins take its toll his performance field . cannon approach story may seem clich�d , but movie never boring nor tiresome . sure , he follows every rule " sport movies handbook " but he it care , good eye love sport . just like sport movies should . movie flows smoothly remarkable football scenes santiago struggle his own personal demons . while times it seems both cannon becker more comfortable sports scenes , movie dose drama well handled completes enjoyable experience . even though it frankly predictable most time , it transmits passion , emotions love game few movies . that why " goal ! " considered successful important film . it first film football soccer transmits emotions made sport most popular sport world . that got worth something . it may not perfect sports film ; however , " goal ! " beginning adventure , hopefully , new way make football movies . this initial film what called " goal ! trilogy " delivers high energy entertainment fans non-fans sport .	-1
this dvd surpassed my highest expectations . when i ordered dvd , i not aware these performances all taken european tv shows . i thought these performances actually recorded live festival , expecting grainy pictures poor audio quality . imagine my surprise seeing buddy guy introduce big mama thornton she walks out onto indoor stage set , not unlike " saturday night live " . despite black white picture , i felt like i really there studio while she sang ! audio quality really good . any context , any stage , these performers all presence spare . considering source ( euro tv ) age film ( some over 40 years old ) , i completely blown away . there no disappointment anywhere this dvd , what great variety classic blues ! electric guitars , acoustic guitars , slide guitar work , male vocalists , female vocalists , chicago style , delta style , slow tunes , upbeat tunes , this dvd it all , absolute best business ! i would strongly recommend this dvd anyone . whether you new blues , diehard fan like myself , or just want see direct ancestors your favorite rock bands , check out this dvd .	1

there countless reviews here , so i make this one short . first , i am always amazed when i meet people who say they figured " usual suspects " out middle movie . i one totally floored . i not see it coming , very surprised [ no spoilers ] . film analyzed , dissected , discussed , over 500 reviews , written quite extensively . however , one things i don't understand why someone would give film one or two stars . there many ' good ' films really never appealed me , however , i see although i might not like film , it good film . therefore , i would not think giving such low marks film this reason ; but would give my analysis what i thought weak film : yet , i would still give film its earned accolades . this film great however . film , " usual suspects " very good very twisted complicated plot . this only makes film better watch . i like these types mysteries . especially ones you can't figure out . specifically when they not spell it out viewer what happening ; but suddenly you find yourself saying , " wow , i never expected ! " these types films twists turns appeal me . if they appeal you , then this film you . i would highly recommend you not only rent film , but purchase it , it belongs your dvd collection . this smart , intelligently written , wonderfully acted suspense thriller take you roller coaster mystery , which keep you riveted your seat . highly recommended .	1

this dvd valuable piece broadway history , it documents process involved recording one landmark cast albums all time , " company " . it interesting see mechanics involved , naturally , but what sticks you determination these tired actors ( they recorded sunday after opening night , their day off ) get permanent record this brilliant , groundbreaking musical . it fun watch them subtly interact if stage . it also touching see these actors they looked thirty-four years ago -- barbara barrie before her harrowing cancer battle , beth howland charles kimbrough before sitcom fame , elaine stritch before england , marriage , widowhood , beating alcoholism . intriguing backstage story lead actor dean jones ' impending departure show still moving ; his misery over crumbling marriage back california led deal director harold prince bring show into new york -- then leave role larry kert . certainly there some wonderful performances captured here ( dean jones , teri ralston silvery vocals , beth howland hysterical patter song , pamela myer run through what may greatest song written new york , " hundred people " ) . but centerpiece indeed elaine stritch struggle get good track down what she called her " three-act play " , " ladies who lunch " . memorable first night , her fatigue gets better her nuance gives way angry shouting . her eyes , wide wild exhaustion , tell volumes . her quiet , dignified exit get rest while orchestra records backing track pure theatre . her triumphant return studio nail perfect take ( indeed , film documents take actually made album ) thrills . she must known this would " one " , she made sure her hair her makeup perfect ( down full false eyelashes) -- she looks beautiful sounds spectacular . stritch present-day commentary protests she matinee later day , hence full stage face . whatever reason , her tough-as-nails beauty shines . dvd extras add fun commentary ( pennebaker , hal prince typically feisty stritch ) photos original production -- i wish they added more ! this very much worth it if you student theatre history or theatre music	1

i wondering what watch this morning saw criterion edition dvd kihachi okamoto " sword doom " my shelf , i thought watching it after silent short wladyslaw starewicz sort light entertainment . not expecting much , i put it my dvd player prepared relax coming two hours . i seen copy this dvd my local library week ago , i never heard anything director i remembered , back cover spoke lots violence blood , made me expect exploitation film vein seijun suzuki only samurais full color . so i surprised bit disappointed when film began black white . but i soon disabused . films black white photography stunning example use light i seen some 60s japanese films ( e.g. seijun suzuki branded kill ) . shot stark contrast , film always seems bit overexposed , creating atmosphere witch viewer may already feel some pain characters , harshness period depicted , through his own constant effort eyes while watching . characters strain stress , atmosphere tautness matched films style . widescreen format used its fullest cinematographer hiroshi murai , almost every frame prime example staging camera , achieving awe-inspiring compositions which mirror characters emotions obsessions , always bringing directors intentions light most original way . editing meticulous , always right spot , its best not only enhancing films atmosphere flow , but deepening our understanding characters psychological profiles . this combination camerawork editing makes film formal level one finest i've ever seen . but complementing this emotional richness speaks directors own experience , life he witnessed during his time army second world war . assistant director amongst others mikio naruse right after war , we witness okamoto " sword doom " already possession not only full-fledged independent perspective life itself , but also cinematic skill , only few directors able achieve put use history cinema . essay accompanying dvd-edition , film-scholar geoffrey o'brien compares okamoto contemporaries like seijun suzuki akira kurosawa , but places him under both , calling him only very competent genre-director , he fails reach under films surface find sense films undertaking besides its obvious merits , when fact okamoto this film alone must ranked humanist director par names like kurosawa , ozu mizoguchi . his clear moral standpoint he still miles ahead formal brilliance playful nihilistic stance seijun suzuki 60s films or other genre directors this time . whatever suzukis merits ( those his colleagues ) their own may , their filmic rebellion one against established way filmmaking , rebellion against restrictions made studios wanted traditional clear-cut products would make maximum profit . but kihachi okamoto , least " sword doom " , isn't just rebelling against industry , but against society could bring such industry existence . film subversive nature goes so far , it reverses assumed creative restrictions , way comparable " dogme " -filmmaking 90s . ( unvoluntarily ) restricting himself , okamoto arrives freedom expression he couldn't achieved better any other way . rebellion doesn't need rebell anymore because it already achieved what it set out within established framework . this may also explain why politics social circumstances film only background character , who isn't concerned any it . what okamoto aiming exceeds society borders far , his endeavour takes him one most pressing existential problems , questioning human soul . beauty sceneries their formal rendering thereby powerful contrast cruelty times outright nihilism characters behaviour . years presented film early 1860 japan events preceding meiji restoration 1868 when power emperor restored . these years political turmoil depicted gruesome period which traditional bonds where slowly dissolving it hard arrive steady existential ideological orientation during ever shifting environment , which violence poverty reigned streets . beginning we introduced main protagonist ryunosuke tsukue , played startling intensity tatsuya nakadai , who serves indicator contradictions problems times . vessel containing all that wrong society itself he psychotic figure who seems bring upon his surroundings wrath fate itself . right start he torn his desire longing affiliation sorts , redemption all his sins ( or maybe even worlds ) , feeling he already too much outcome his times , unable lay down his sword change his life . he once angel fallen earth who bringing its destruction , human deeply conflict himself , his instincts emotions . tragic film character , thus its time , seems unability change , good when it most needed , powerlessness man face human society bringing its own end . throughout film we see ryunosuke struggle preserve his humanity though it lost him beginning . this lies main strength humanity what film tries achieve . struggle man against his fate , no matter how hopeless it may seem , even while facing defeat , what ultimately makes person human . let us experience this through seemingly nihilistic character , confronting us bleak world , bold undertaking which okamoto succeeds magnificent way . film initially planned executed first installment much larger tale , it huge loss sequels never made . nevertheless this film alone , all its ambiguities gaps , already stands firmly its own , displaying all features needed establish it major work art .	1

early days movies , studios often their specialties . mgm musicals . universal monster movies . warner brothers gangster movies . emphasis " common " people - those growing up urban tenements or working-class professions - warner brothers created its own special niche , process , defined gangster movie so well influence these films still seen today . chronological order ( one exception , explained below ) , this set starts little caesar , edward . robinson vicious gangster rico , who goes minor hoodlum gang boss . this film - made early sound era - definitely dated but its strengths , particularly robinson , who center movie . way , this film prototype gangster genre , not fully formed but showing shape things come . next first four james cagney movies , public enemy . this movie , genre hits its stride its tale tom powers . beginning this movie , we begin see reasons why these men turn crime , especially poverty . powers , cagney brutal character who nonetheless values friendship family , particular his mother , gentle but weak woman who turns blind eye her son flaws therefore can't stop him . cagney returned angels dirty faces , where he contends pat o'brien , his childhood friend turned priest humphrey bogart , his craven but evil lawyer . here , cagney generally likeable character who idol local street kids ( dead end kids ) . he also likeable roaring twenties wwi vet who driven crime after finding no opportunities " legitimate " world . finally , white heat , he psychopathic cody jarrett , gang leader big mother fixation ; while far pleasant person , cagney still able make cody somewhat sympathetic . exception this set movies petrified forest , which , while very good , not fully fit other films . while other movies all distinctly urban , petrified forest takes place isolated desert caf . addition , while other movies take place over course months or years , petrified forest takes place over few hours . finally , petrified forest not focus gangster , this case duke mantee ( played excellently bogart breakthrough role ) , but rather romance leslie howard bette davis ) . this top-notch set classic gangster movies pleasure watch beginning end . addition films themselves , there some great commentary tracks provide extra insight , mini-documentaries each film " warner night movies " feature allows viewer watch old-time trailer , newsreel , short subject cartoon prior main feature . some boxed sets hit-or-miss ; this one definitely hit	1

i can't possibly put into words how great war movie this , but it touched me deep inside . me , there little greater honor than serve one country , especially time unpopular war . i felt his film portrayed desire world warriors answer call duty honorable men , regardless side you fighting . perhaps one my favorite things this movie . albeit small part , time given " other " side we allowed glimpse enemy warriors . end , lt . col . moore paid homage , sense , enemy he fought . , course , actual footage moore shown extras ( bonuses must see ! ) praising his men -- nearly weeping he so . time when only reason people join service college money , servicemen scramble get out service when war comes , this movie reminds us we should much more grateful few serve dignity it because they americans love their country enough answer call when it comes . without these honorable warriors , there would no america	1

when fantasia came out 1938 , it bombed . many years later , movie received acclaim it deserved . fantasia enchanted me since i child , i eagerly awaited fantasia 2000 . possibilities ! i sure disney would come up something rival original . what i saw humorless , boring mish-mash only few bright spots . opening segment whales flying through space embarrassingly bad . silly flamingos also fell flat . donald duck noah terrific . gershwin piece ok , but not fantasia . what should crowning achievement , forest nymph battling save her beloved forest , predictable stale . this film almost complete waste my time money . i heartily , heartily , endorse orginal fantasia timeless classic all ages	-1
i say , it took me while getting around seeing this . i thought " silence lambs " good - it featured great performance anthony hopkins , rest it .... good . but it , far i concerned . it just didn't really click me , it wasn't anything near great movie i'd hoping , so when its sequel released i didn't feel any great need rush out get it soon it released . bit surprisingly though , i thought " hannibal " really great once i finally see it . everyone said it more geared toward horror than " silence ... " ( which fine me ) it may , marginally . but much more than , it just better horror movie than its predecessor , it also better thriller better drama movie , my opinion . hopkins just good , if not better , than he dr. hannibal lecter first time around , while i usually don't like recasting roles movie ( unless actor or actress playing creature or monster or something where you don't see their real face or hear their real voice , even there they sometimes end up getting mannerisms wrong ) julianne moore great job stepping into clarice starling role originally played jodie foster . movie centers around hunt find lecter only victim his original , pre-incarceration , carnage survive - thoroughly despicable pedophile who avoided ever charged his crimes cutting deal prosecutors give evidence against lecter . it seems like " hannibal " changed tract " silence " implying most if not all lecter victims may horrendous individuals who some way brought his wrath down upon themselves . whether that truth or whether it just this one victim who so reprehensible , effect create foil hannibal who even more evil than he . hannibal lecter himself , well , he not ' good guy ' this movie ; he , though , presented very cryptic shades grey . his behaviors contradict one but so way feels real , he much more interesting character this time around . clarice also ; she comes across here character who somehow traumatized , perhaps even mentally unbalanced , deep down but supresses it so well it took genius like lecter ever see it , that what so intrigued him first place . one possible interpretation things overall ( this just one many potential takes it ; movie briefly subtly hints so many different things you could take away just anything it - making it great source conversation movie-lovers ) hannibal lecter person who had/has potential great goodness within himself but chose evil , while clarice starling potential great darkness hannibal-level violence her , but chose good , chose fact make her career opposing those who give same darkness . lot food thought this one ( no pun intended ) . great performances all around ; notable addition hopkins moore brilliant gary oldman plays lecter nemesis chronically overlooked under-rated ray liotta plays unlikable , rather creepy fbi agent who constantly odds starling . very , very engaging wel-made movie	-1
everyone remembers 1963 series where dr. richard kimble ( david janssen ) goes running around every episode just missing criminal killed his wife . he turn chased lt . philip gerard ( barry morse ) who thinks kimble it fugitive law . whole thing narrated william conrad . well now we movie . this time we beginning middle ending all 161 minutes . dr. richard kimble ( harrison ford ) his wife helen ( sela ward ) perfect couple . then one night while he working some inexplicable reason despicable person dispatches helen . her way netherworld she inadvertently says richard 911 call . one thing leads kimble gets blame . process transporting him one containment system transport meets little accident ; now kimble free find locate real perpetrator . now it up marshal samuel gerard ( tommy lee jones ) find retrieve kimble . now we covered basic there not where begin tell how great this movie many levels . anticipation chase kimble find perpetrator ( way he only one arm ) before gerard catches him . we get close few read herrings . tommy lee gets keep his stoic look he says things like " i don't care .

" personaly i think chicago police knew all who real bad guy covering him several times right up end . they went out there way paint kimble bad guy . detective rosetti ( joseph . kosala ) also tried stop him revealing real perpetrator . rosetti referring kimball even after truth revealed " he going down . you won't help us , you stay hell out !

this movie funniest sight gags movies i've seen past . this movies plot isn't confusing people may think , because jim abrahams ( director ) always made sense all his movies . movie starts off anthony ( i forgot his last name , narrorator movie ) how mafia hussled people their money casinos around las vegas . it shows games casino people played where " you possibly couldn't win " , that how they became rich . then you go back time sicily 1901 shows how vincenzo , anthony father , grew up how he became part mafia . after vincenzo found out package he delivering , containing cocaine , supposed given gangster his father worked , he chased became wanted person . he separated his mother after friends his family hid im butt donkey during escape gangsters chasing after him . he swam across ocean arrived new york . that how movie became what it . this movie basically sight comedy , fart jokes get old , but this movie leave you laughing till end . i suprised this movie didn't leslie nielsen . i look this movie think myself " if this movie this hilarious without leslie nielsen , thin how much funnier it would've him .

this movie still rocks after all these years since it first came out . excellent energetic movie start . plot cutesy . it serves vehicle wonderful selection songs dance sequences . however , i think this version movie missing few scenes ? i would rate this movie version 5 stars it unedited me . if memory serves me , didn't alex receive letter her friend , hannah , when alex discovered hannah passed away ? isn't there reconnection end mickey alex ( girl)friend whom latter dating ? wasn't there more story build-up alex her boss ? if this version cut anyway , i prefer getting complete unedited version . i find this version incomplete somehow . but jennifer beals looks terrific one wonders why she didn't star more movies her generation	-1
so ummm ... this werewolves ? native american shape shifters ? or pack ordinary wolves loose nyc ? damned if i know damned if director , screenwriter , cast crew know either . wolfen one them there horror movies where true face terror things aren't really explained or make much sense . this effective device movies , go watch any david lynch movie immerse yourself sense mystery enigma . wolfen however , effect mostly people wandering around doing stuff saying things then there some action end then movie over . maybe they going some kind kaffkaesque feeling dread , but this came out year after chaddyshack , so frankly i doubt it . albert finney joins distinguished ranks obviously foreign actors playing big city american cop-he ah-nuld proud ! gregory hines plays guy who jokes lot , i'm not sure but he might cop too . edward james olmos plays native american construction worker who smiles lot knows more than he saying , he would play better version this character year later , blade runner . i'm sure there some people reading this who enraged consider me obtuse unsophisticated not picking up nuances directon script . least , i certainly hope such people exist because maybe one or more them could track me down explain me what crap going here . i eagerly await your responses ! ps- case you wondering , no i haven't read novel movie based . i suppose i could but whitley strieber said inerviews his horror novels metaphors his alien abduction experiences , so i most likely won't get help there ..	-1

this movie should shown classrooms aspiring screenwriters directors example how not sucked into hollywood junk machine . screenwriter this movie obviously some ideas coherent story he wanted tell moral relativity corrupt military officials . this film story structure mostly influenced classic film rashomon . well , so what happened ? how this ungracious disaster movie make it big screen ? biggest culprits easily movie stars , john travolta samuel . jackson , using their bloated star egos force screenwriter rework his material into something they ultimately found more suitable their star personas . disgusting ! travolta supposed bad guy jackson supposed bite bullet , but no way would two hollywood jerks allow ! spoiler alert : who their right mind surprised ending ? i knew sam jackson it get go soon enough he would grace us his presence . lo behold , his bald head emerges end movie wearing white outfit like angel some sort . i hate this movie , it insult audience ! john mctiernan , ( predator , die hard ) , director basic should ashamed such lackluster effort his part . but what could he when faced two morons who played leads ! sad joke movie , avoid it unless you just love junk	-1

while average movie watcher may not recognize name betsy russell ( private school , cheerleader camp ) , those us males who grew up 1980s , weaned hours dedicated cable viewing , know her something akin goddess world dumb , teen comedies basically two reasons ... she one fine babe , she didn't seem mind showing some skinage , evident film tomboy ( 1985 ) , among others . originally released crown international pictures , film directed herb freed ( graduation day , survival game ) stars , i mentioned , ms. russell . also appearing gerard christopher ( " superboy " ) , kristi somers ( hardbodies ) , richard erdman ( blue gardenia ) , late eric douglas ( flamingo kid ) , youngest son actor kirk douglas . russell plays tomasina `tommy ' boyd , tomboy through through who spends her days working cars , shooting hoops boys , riding her motorcycle . after fairly schmaltzy pointless opening sequence showing tommy girl , playing baseball boys , scoring run , ultimately hugging her father ( who apparently astronaut air force ) , all slow motion montage form , we're now present tommy rises bed proceeds shower ... some skin but no goodies ... yet ... man , you wouldn't think you could jealous sponge ... anyway , tommy works mechanic chester garage , dumpy filling station where she often visited her girly girl friend seville ( somers ) , aspiring broadway dancer who seems little problem sleazing her way up ladder success , evident later film . after witnessing dance audition seville her troupe , one performed some potential financial backers ( surprisingly enough they declined investing seville her rotten routine ) , we're back garage big time stock car driver/professional pretty boy randy starr ( christopher ) , who tommy got serious crush ... seems randy hired local rich infinitely sleazy dink named ernie leeds , jr. race him , randy offers tommy invitation come leeds ' house check out his boss stock car . after this we see seville auditioning donut commercial , whoring it up good , followed tommy seville heading leeds ' house where tommy randy race around motocross bikes ( one point tommy crashes swampy morass , resulting her revealing her tommy `guns , if only get out her wet clothes ... hootchie mama ! ) . following this there party sequence leeds ' house ( parachute pants far eye see ) , tommy randy hook up , evident overly long montage sequence featuring pair engaging all sorts outdoor activities , but eventually they falling out tommy shows randy up race track while important sponsor attendance , result pair deciding race each other settle once all who best driver ... while tomboy pure 1980s teenage hokum through through , it fairs better than its counterparts based solely presence betsy russell her generous `assets ' , her willingness put them display . movie itself actually played like one , long series mentos commercials . one example this early tommy riding her motorcycle work she stops off engage game basketball some local chumps . through bit creative editing russell makes all her shots , but then here kicker ... she leaving , she climbs aboard her motorcycle one dudes tosses her ball . she catches it one hand , puts it up , swoosh ! it goes ... she drives off yahoos begin high fivin ' each other , apparently overjoyed fact they've just emasculated losing girl their own sport . i learn lot things this film , including following ... 1 . i'd give my left gonasticle betsy russell loofa . 2 . pretentious , forgettable pop songs 1980s , often featured films like this , generally included meaningless lyrics like `you got magic , i got fire ' . 3 . nothing gets women hotter than chasing them around town your muscle car , throwing constant barrage catcalls their direction . 4 . when sign warns `severe tire damage ' , they ain't kidding . 5 . untalented bimbos could manage find success given their willingness whore it up . 6 . someone other than jimmy `j . . ' walker actually used phrase `dy-no-mite!' 1980s . 7 . when doing television commercial donuts performers actually get paid donuts . 8 . goofy , slow motion montages great way pad out film . 9 . when waiting woman meet you date it probably not good idea let her walk you while you're watching porn she'll think you're some kind skeevy perv . 10 . apparently , world stock car racing , slapping jet engine onto your vehicle isn't considered illegal modification . performances passable movie like this ( although idea betsy russell tomboy seemed bit farfetched ) , but writing pretty lousy ( this one predictable they come ) . i seriously doubt anyone sitting edge their seat end this one , wondering if plucky tommy would beat arrogant randy race , thus validating tommy belief woman anything well man . i love these kinds films , though , they take superficial mask female empowerment while passing copious amounts nekkid female flesh ( russell character only female came off remotely decent here ) . i gag little some schmaltz-laden montages but overall , i'd say this entertaining , three star ( out five ) feature , extra star thrown ms. russell . picture quality this bci dvd release , presented widescreen ( 1.85 : 1 ) , looks pretty decent , dolby digital stereo audio comes through well enough . there aren't any extras , except few trailers some other bci dvd releases their crown international classics ( i wouldn't necessarily refer some many them `classics ' ) series including hunk ( 1987 ) , beach girls ( 1982 ) , jocks ( 1987 ) , my chauffer ( 1986 ) . cookieman108	-1

i am continually impressed movies mexico . these movies spun around very simple close-to-life stories , but superlative acting , cinematography , background score direction makes them extremely interesting , intriguing , thought-provoking entertaining . story starts grandpa rodrigo birthday reluctant gathering family members . his daughter , two sons two diagonally opposite cousins ( roco rodrigo ) . tense volatile atmosphere dinner table quickly erupts into heated dialog ( over grandpa rodrigo son marriage young demure girl ) . predictably , grandpa rodrigo massive heart-attack he passes away . without much delay , his read inheritance distributed . amidst all materialistic distribution , nobody seems pay much attention grandpa wish his ashes submerged sea acapulco . days , his ashes lay golden urn . flustered everyone nonchalant behavior , roco grabs urn starts heading towards acapulco vintage mercedes . vintage , however , inheritance gift rodrigo jr.

you know , criterion collection long leader providing classic films best possible condition , first laserdisc later dvd . when it comes film restoration , they're certainly among best companies out there . yet , it my feeling company largely unknown outside relatively small but dedicated group film enthusiasts , whose passion art cinema equals criterion . well , , plus fact company largely focused their attention foreign films mainstream moviegoing public never heard . sure , there exceptions , such their first-class hitchock releases ( notorious , spellbound , rebecca few others ); bona-fide classics like spartacus , stones ' gimme shelter ; few oddball modern choices : royal tennenbaums , armageddon (?) , rock (??) . which why i so happy find couple cult sci-fi films their catalog few years back . both original version blob ( 1958 ) , sorely underrated fiend without face filled me hope maybe , just maybe , these folks capable something more . fact , trailers all four films this collection included bonus materials fiend . now , films themselves : haunted strangler corridors blood vehicles boris karloff , who his sixties when they made . he many times before ( would continue ) , karloff plays mad doctor-type . corridors better two , young christopher lee supporting role ruthless killer . neither film could really called " classic , " but both solid , low-budget chillers fans karloff and/or lee enjoy . atomic submarine more straight sci-fi adventure story , title vehicle facing off against underwater ufo . again , this " " picture all way , but it retains some charm spite overuse newsreel footage . first man into space treads more familiar territory , organism space inhabits body astronaut . thing craves blood , so you guess what happens next . not bad little film , but probably least bunch . i applaud criterion making these films available pristine condition . i'm sure there audience more same type films . only downfall this collection -- all criterion discs -- price .	-1

sometimes there seems no rhyme or reason combinations movies they come up these 2-packs but " mullholland drive " " swimming pool " they came up quirky combo . if you not like david lynch those who make movies mold then you should know going just avoid these two . but if you like quirky films force you think figure out what hell just happened movie , then this well-suited pair . " mulholland drive " written directed david lynch certainly more style than substance , lynch creating his more surrealistic film yet . there might those who think this some sort film noir because there scene where couple hard-boiled cops show up spout film noir type dialogue . but there bits pieces different film genres throughout film , which clue tapestry lynch tale . when second main character drama , betty ( naomi watts ) , gets off plane hollywood ready pursue her quest become star , it never dawned me there more kindly old couple wishes her well drive off limosine . betty moves into apartment , only discover rita , who apparently suffered amnesia after her near death experiences , taking shower . betty canada , so she opts helping rita rather than calling police . two become friends more than friends couple best sex scenes seen movie last decade ( they also serve underscore how unsexy most sex scenes movies today ) . " mulholland drive " movie hollywood , or more appropriately dream hollywood . it means something rita , who remember her real name , pulls one she uses movie poster " gilda . " betty plucky young kids sticks who wants star . unwritten rule such people they would anything achieve their dream sense lynch film just flips dream over looks nightmare side equation . however , i no problem idea many those who watch this film " muholland drive " not come close making sense them until second time they see it many those people not going make effort . those us who seen lynch other films , most notably " eraserhead " " blue velvet , " we knew going probably going necessary . i mean , come . this david lynch people . what you expect ? " swimming pool , " i would say it more sensual than it erotic , although ultimately nudity this film secondary story . sarah morton ( charlotte rampling ) british writer crime fiction who apparently find no joy her writing , her popularity , her publisher , or any idea any other writer might writing something worth reading well . everyone waiting next installment her detective she uninspired . so her publisher ( charles dance ) offers her use his villa france place where she retreat come up new book . once there sarah explores house , taking notice leaf covered swimming pool back . she also begins write , although we no idea what she writing , sarah seems productive happy . then julie ( ludivine sagnier ) , daughter her publisher shows up unexpected guest . not only because sarah assumed she would alone , but because she not know he daughter . if anything , sarah waiting him show up so she get little relaxation her rest . instead julie shows up violates not only sarah privacy but here sense propriety . julie tends walk around topless pool apparently shows no sense discrimination bringing home men sleep . we know sarah disapproves such practices , but this not stop her watching julie , whether she swimming villa pool or making love some strange man . it then becomes clear not only julie becoming part sarah novel , but something going happen . " swimming pool " usually described thriller , but strikes me off mark . it more mystery , but subtle way , which explains why it difficult talk director fran�ois ozon film without giving away too much . this sort film where you going go back least watch end film again , if not entire thing start finish ( just like " mulholland drive " ) , make sure you understand what happened . what helped me out untangling this film most it i kept asking what sarah writing . there clearly connection what happening what sarah writing , but i kept waiting ozon show us what , which , end , only goes show how much i fooled this film . this regard film ends up surprising rather than shocking , keeping subtlety sensuality film . although they both quirky films they certainly odd decidedly different ways it interesting see which these two you end up preferring . last piece advice not watch them same week ( watching them back back would incredibly weird things your brain ) .	-1

premise this movie competent but quiet unexciting accountant ( pignon ) getting fired no particular reason except someone go he considered expendable , something zero eyes his employer coworkers . opening scene says it all when he willingly omitted annual company photo staff : he not missed anyone . pignon very depressed considering ending it all when his new neighbor adjoining balcony intervenes . neighbor idea help him : he should pretend he gay then his employer too concerned " correctness " fire him -- they'll bend over backwards pretend they're not prejudiced . neighbor ( retired industrial psychologist ) doctors up some photos head accountant ( pignon ) bodies some gays entering gay night club . these sent anonymously pignon boss , quickly photocopied spread throughout company . president quickly decides it would very bad strategy fire pignon , because these days , they wouldn't want alienate gay market , particularly since they make condoms . it sounds like thin one-joke movie , but actors good enough it quite amusing doesn't drag . gerard depardieu ( very funny guy ) plays santini , captain company rugby team who aggressively heterosexual makes disparaging remarks gays constantly . he warned he better buddy up pignon ( coworkers who basically playing joke him ) or else he'll get fired . subplots involve pignon relationship his ex-wife estranged son . there very funny scene pignon gay pride parade . whole film made less obnoxious episode involving gay-bashing ( violent ) makes it clear subject really rather serious , even if film funny .	-1

chinatown shows up top five all-time films so many people , it probably difficult say what it exactly people find so wonderful it . absolute magnetism deft performance its emerging star , jack nicholson , no doubt one its stronger assets . while story brilliantly unique quite interesting , it not exciting , per se ; it dutifully structured detective genre , aside occasional outburst violence , rather quiet cerebral . screenwriter storyteller robert towne scenes dialogue spare but sparkling , cinematography film editing . perhaps its greatest asset its director , roman polanski who , his art set directors , magically re-creates los angeles it 30 . whether staging scenes against bleached white adobe , palm-lined street twilight , or office bathed venetian blind shadows , polanski gets perfect , painterly shot every frame . he effortlessly guides all his actors -- lead supporting alike -- subtle , but heartfelt performances . this one those movies where actors seem believe they themselves time place they actually characters they portraying . add all this moody , evocative score its unforgettable love theme suddenly economical becomes expansive , filling screen dazzling movie-making its best . devastatingly powerful last scene screen legend , rivalled , perhaps , only casablanca .	1

i remember how movie hit me when it first released . i not yet 30 , fairly recently married myself , pretty relentless seeing every new non-traditional american movie i could . mazursky personal favourite , especially bob carol , next stop blume love . he telling stories no one else dared tell -- no cross-country mythic hippes , no foul tongue-lashing nicholson vehicle , not even fonda ( jane ) showing just how sexy glum . jill clayburgh perfectly suited era -- attractive without wondrous , teeth imperfect shown up close without apology , dancing her panties ( clayburgh signature would later become tedious ) -- most all her genuine humanity , self-deprecating manner heartbreaking vulnerability . she both movie star clean normal , same time . looking film now , it fascinating try distinguishing whether its original power any currency . i showed film college class first-year students , all women coincidence , they split -- many thought it coy many others startled greater power this film over sex city -- what emerged seminar , what i think sets this movie apart " its time nothing more " , women film viewed mature ( good way ) , searching human beings , while quartet gals sex city seen desperately clinging their notions youth exclusion their own deeper needs desires . class really taken aback when they realized women mazursky film same age samantha , carrie co . , alone , makes " unmarried woman " worth adding important film lists	1

this very good movie i watched my " horror classics collection : 50 pack " ( asin : b0001hagtm ) i got amazon ( under $20.00 ! ) . so first off , i would recommend buying 50 pack where you get 2 other vincent price movies ( bat last man earth ) 47 other good movies almost same price buying this movie itself . far this movie goes , there few suspenseful parts you wonder what going happen . mainly , movie give you some memorable quotes , vincent price always deliver great voice his . all characters good job acting ( typist great scream ! ) . some parts seem bit unbelievable some questions don't seem get answered , but who really cares ? only 75 minutes long , this movie better than most horror movies come out today unoriginal go shock value . so while this might more murder mystery than " horror " movie , it worth watch you'll satisfied end ... unless course , you not like black white movies , if case , then you probably wouldn't reading this review . p.s. i love gary . taylor review when he says : " price plays it slightly prissy , very high-camp manner tremendous dose black humor which he so famous .

acting especially leads ( moon so-ri sol kyung-gu ) fantastic ; moon performance convinced me she truly disabled . also , pace felt faster than it actually . beautiful cinematography , like so many korean films . i saw this seoul when it opened , two native korean friends who also loved it . while i remain little ambivalent how so many acclaimed korean dramas portray rape , this film able make protagonists ' disabilities secondary plot not focus . sometimes difficult watch , this movie wouldn't made hollywood , it definitely worth watching	1
edges lord received very little publicity when it released , american release went straight dvd . yet this film demands watching more than once . haley joel osment gives possibly his best performance ever , says lot considering his outstanding efforts sixth sense , pay it forward , a.i. , second hand lions . he portrays young jewish boy poland during nazi occupation , who sent live catholic family rural poland , where he must pose catholic order survive . only person , besides family he living , who knows his true identity , village priest played william dafoe who gives understated yet excellent performance . drama intense throughout , but it builds even more intense climax . all children movie give remarkable performances which further serve show true nature what it like live under nazi occupation whether jew or christian . this movie not missed , it movie should watched together families children above age 1	1

poster owen coughlan pretty much said it all , but it warrants seconded . taking purely subjective approach - concentrating those genres , films amp ; filmmakers which hold special significance him - martin scorsese makes not only these subjects live breathe , but captures entire history american film manner informs , excites even inflames viewer measure scorsese own archivist passion medium . his refusal tout his own body work , soft-pedaling impressive filmography anyone assembled , order keep focus men women who sculpted built artform first seduced him wide-eyed four-year-old both touching typical scorsese reverence his forebears . many lesser-known neglected films sampled here serve dual purpose : one , dowsing rods pointing worthwhile movies left off general-consensus , afi-type lists ; secondly , reminders we've all seen extraordinary films dismissed or ignored critics , public , even ourselves earlier points . you'll finish watching this great doc champing bit go rent roaring 20s phenix city story sure , but you'll also want begin your own voyage rediscovery through 100 years movie history wide eyes seeing new exotic old once-familiar . can't ask more than any historical documentary - well , i'd've loved this even more twice length , but let not get greedy ..	1

rule #1 gothic film criticism : products hollywood ( this year disgrace 2006 ) absolute tripe -- worthless or less than worthless . it should therefore come no surprise best lycanthrope movies recent times both foreign : british-luxembourg production " dog soldiers " canadian gem " ginger snaps . " differences two films striking ; while " dog soldiers " focuses very manly men encountering werewolves scottish highlands , " ginger snaps " concerns two teenage sisters , one whom metamorphosing into werewolf . first film inevitably recalls " night living dead " inasmuch title soldiers barricade themselves farmhouse withstand lycanthropes ' onslaught . " ginger snaps , " however , calls mind depalma " carrie " associating onset menstruation dark supernatural forces . both films share common bond extraordinary imagination -- both present very appealing/magnetic characters facing most horrific situations . all working-class infantrymen " dog soldiers " portrayed sympathetically , yet without sentimentality : they true iron men -- " balls british steel " -- unable destroy their supernatural opponents , but capable looking death straight eye while going down fighting . samurai ! girls " ginger snaps " comparably impressive : suburban goths , they obsessed idea violent , indeed gruesome death . furthermore , title character ( acted superbly katharine isabelle ) superior -- gifted cynical insight into world , insight which seems far beyond her years apparent experience . effect , she visual verbal artist cruelly destined slow transformation into four-footed monstrosity ! much victim predator , she seems more ambiguous figure than heroic warriors " dog soldiers . " nevertheless , she never loses one interest or sympathy ; even monster , she least avoids banality she spent her life loathing . despair mingled delirium becomes dominant mood " ginger snaps . " thus one point ginger imagines herself " force nature " ; but minutes later , her sensuous beauty takes grotesque turn , pathetically she asks her sister brigitte " what am i ? " contrast , keynote " dog soldiers " exhilaration -- joy battle , however futile battle may seem . despite apparent differences tone , both movies converge masterpieces nightmarish vision -- wonderfully crafted , yet bristling expressive energy ; respect , fierce emotional interplay charismatic ginger more withdrawn , sensitive brigitte simply unequaled . horror just doesn't come more convincing or compelling shape than " ginger snaps .

" mississippi mermaid " early francois truffaut film , if it looks familiar -- it may you've seen " original sin " -- angelina jolie/antonio banderas remake film . louis mahe ( jean-paul belmondo ) plays wealthy factory owner who lives small island , reunion , near africa . beginning film , louis eagerly expecting arrival his mail-order bride . photo hand , he impatiently waits her arrive , when he confronted julie roussel ( catherine deneuve ) who not woman photo , he happily swallows story she sent him photo someone else -- after all , they both engaged minor deceits during their courtship mail , so he overlooks warning signals marries her anyway . soon , louis becomes suspicious his new bride real identity , but he continues elect acceptance . however , when he receives letter julie sister demanding know why she hasn't heard julie , he forced confront julie . julie promptly cleans out joint bank account disappears ... i never fan jean-paul belmondo . however , this film , his facial expressions extremely impressive , i began see perhaps i overlooked him past . catherine deneuve plays chilling julie roussel/marion vergano . beginning film , deneuve plays demure julie , but when persona julie dumped , deneuve assumes identity marion , ice queen emerges . whereas angelina played julie/marion role sizzling passion , deneuve icy , controlling evil . however , this precise reason it difficult understand why mahe continued adore julie/marion . partnership hell theory just doesn't hold on-screen relationship mahe marion -- there wasn't enough sexual chemistry explain it . perhaps it can't helped given age film , but denueve manage two topless scenes -- one which almost causes car acciden t.t he film dated . airplane travel scenes tedious . when it time action , camera just speeds up , effect preposterous . however , " mississippi mermaid " well worth look if you die-hard fan either french cinema or catherine deneuve -- displacedhuma	-1

mccabe mrs. miller often talked one list director robert altman seventies films takes cinematic genre ( namely western ) subverts it point making it seem like attack its cinematic precedents . traditional western gung-ho heroism nowhere evidence , it seems , mccabe mere parody hero director invites audience laugh . if this case , than mccabe mrs. miller would , best , looked upon satirical look-back cinematic tastes fifties . self-congratulatory " how far we've come ...

shakespeare much ado nothing my first shakespeare play , read or studied , no means i disappointed . i enjoyed humor , mistaken identities , sense foolishness love . shakespeare comedy although written several years ago still proves relevant today . his use love crazy things people find it , once found keep it , always prove timeless message . shakespeare mainly communicates how foolish deliberate people act when they find themselves love . title also elaborates fact people spend entirely too much time worrying nothing . characters become enthralled present ignore future reality their circumstances . many characters also develop sense selfishness when asked choose themselves or any one else . later story we see benedick choose love over himself his characters changes softens through his own confused heart . character don john tries stir up trouble soon married claudio hero . through cleverly thought out mistaken identity infatuated pair soon dwindle public disgrace , only found innocent end . after this action occurred beatrice tells benedick she would like see his friend claudio dead what he her cousin . benedick chooses women he loves over friend he knows . although benedick not kill claudio he still made this agreement his heart betray him . amusing aspect play constant changing relationship beatrice benedick . we first find them deeply involved their continuous war words . soon these two bickering characters find love through fight through constant misunderstanding these characters display hopeful love one . however , reader left questioning whether or not this love true . one my favorite scenes takes place orchard when claudio , don pedro , leonato plan trick attentively listening benedick . knowing he only feet away , behind bushes , shakespeare writing pokes fun his feelings future desires beatrice . i love humor way their one conversation alters benedick choices . important comic relief character would dogsberry his trusty assistant verges . usage malapropism adds humor story it message unable matched any other character . shakespeare making point characters this story illustrating their obsession hear now instead looking grand picture their situations . he showing his readers not take life or your relationships too seriously . aspect this play posed point went equally previous lesson crazy things people love . characters this story often would just pick up anything person they felt they loved ., flip side would just quickly forget person . example these actions when claudio hero their misunderstanding claudio shamed her front their town what he understood betrayal . immediacy actions urgency reason all often compromised characters their emotions . much ado nothing refreshing comedy light , but also significant meaning . shakespeare truly captures mind humans seeking love crazy world . play proves relevant although language may different story not unlike our society today . i would absolutely recommend this play anyone looking watch humorous love story unfold before them . i very much enjoyed reading shakespeare cleverly envelops his reader into story crazy characters their crazier reactions love misunderstandings . i so much fun watching this play performed seeing genius unfold shakespeare intended us all see . this play not soon nor easily forgotten generations come . i'm so happy opened its cover now hold it my bookshelf .	1
i am generous giving this film two stars . i saw trailer it , while it looked intriguing , looks deceiving , much like bulk this would-be psychological potboiler . i think photography work acting deserve minimum two stars both excellent ; general storyline , however , drivel . many reviewers noted how film fundamentally makes no sense , there parts where i agree wholeheartedly . i don't mind thought-provoking films leave you wondering what actually happened , but this mostly shallow end standpoint plot construction . it inconceivable me how two female leads ( charlotte rampling , ludivine sagnier ) could tolerate one ; further , it incomprehensible why rampling didn't merely leave france when sagnier started making her life miserable . believe rampling would actually help sagnier conceal murder impossible . yes , i know entire character daughter ambiguous end , but inasmuch character constructed rampling mind murderess negates charges cinematic intellectual superiority holds rampling judgment suspec t.t he entire movie filled characters excruciating watch , only real reason two star rating actors outstanding job their roles . i considered briefly watching film second time make sure i understood all nuances , but i just hated it too much first time give it second chance . this one film looks positively great two minute theatrical trailer , but looks positively awful light day hulking 103 minute feature . i am very open-minded unusual , imported , avant-garde films , but while this movie touches all three , i merely relieved when it over .	-1

matthew bourne version nutcracker storyline begins victorian orphanage , where dr. dross ( drosselmeyer traditional version ) his wife portrayed pompous meanies who intimidate kids . further contrasting original , dross children ungrateful , spoiled brats , act true form during their visit orphanage . governors arrive inspect ward , but there more bickering than revelry , presents they've brought children get taken away soon " festivity " ( read commotion ) over . come bedtime , clara dreams nutcracker doll ( who dead ringer puppet howdy doody show ; hilarious ! ) comes life , breaks apart walls orphanage , whisks her away snowy paradise . second act takes us " sweetieland , " where everything ( everyone , apparently ) made candy . when clara falls love nutcracker prince , love triangle (!) results when sugar plum fairy also makes overtures prince . after requisite series theme dances we're back orphanage , where clara wakes up discover her " prince " actually one boys ward . unique mix characters storyline held my attention throughout , help original tchaikovsky score enabled me keep my bearings beginning end ( i.e. , " so this music occurs when this character . . . " ) . more one familiar traditional nutcracker story , easier it make leap into mr. bourne fantasy , comparisons this original interpretations more interesting enlightening . [ i would definitely not recommend this anyone first viewing nutcracker]the dancers/actors display over-emoted gestures facial expressions , but this necessary convey much more comical spirited production ( performance filmed before live audience ) . expected , choreography also strays traditional , incorporating mix modern dance , swing , even folkloric elements . i like this lot . you see hint more traditional ballet steps , although , without pointe shoes " ballerinas " more free execute diversity movement . choreography amazingly tight , even curtain call cast taking positions cue . costumes anything but traditional , ranging dull , threadbare orphanage clothing wild , feathery , colorful ( pink dominates ) outfits sweetieland . some clever elements incorporated into mr. bourne storyline allusions movies ( " one flew over cuckoo nest " one ) some bits playful sexual innuendo-sweetieland characters licking each other well candy ( children likely remain unaffected ) . also , ending dance suite involves many highly self-absorbed personas who , when not watching themselves mirrors , seem playing out game one-upmanship dance dance . very fun watch . sound quality fantastic : clear , bright , well balanced . camera work made excellent use both traditional oblique-angle perspectives , but many instances image framing where performers cut off waist ( my pet peeve ) , thus depriving viewer some excellent footwork body language . run time 80+ minutes zipped pretty quickly , i would enjoyed seeing some scenes played out little longer . still , it good show , i'd recommend this performance anyone but firs t-t ime nutcracker viewers or ballet traditionalists	-1
i started watch eternal " sunshine spotless mind " , after first 15 minutes i realized i could not turn it off drive work ( which i supposed ) . i what jim kerry character joel - i called my boss left her message i would late . i stayed home i watched film . i cried , i laughed , i sighed , i felt - i lived through it . there not so many films we don't just watch but live through - me , esotsm . finally , charlie kaufman film i absolutely love . " john malkovich " amused me ; " adaptation " irritated me - too much charlie there my taste even if he looked like nic cage . " eternal sunshine ... " kaufman masterpiece relationships , memories , reality , intolerance , impatience , inability listen others , understand them . how easy it insult one you love most . how difficult it forgive yourself . how often we rely modern technology fix our inner problems . how seldom we realize painful happy memories go together . you not get rid ones keep others . it may not best romance film ever but it damn close . it tender poignant valentine card kaufman sent all us - remind us love exists , relationships survive , even if they die , we memories them , nobody or nothing take our memories us . it just coincidence kaufman references second time tragic great love eloisa abelard his works ? i applaud michel gondry his brilliant directing ; supporting cast , including tom wilkinson , mark ruffalo , kirsten dunst . jim carrey kate winslet played their best roles ever i hope see carrey more often dramatic performances . but beginning everything there word - without kaufman screenplay film would not happened . thank you , charlie .	1

fan zombie movies someone who enjoyed city living dead zombie , i very disappointed house cemetery . fulci manages create good mystery first two-thirds movie , only squander it some poorly executed scare scenes . house cemetery researcher ( whose work never specified ) who moves his wife his kid into house massachussets order finish out work colleague who killed himself his mistress . titular house only place they really find moment , so dr. boyle , his wife lucy their son bob move despite lot bad signs , like boarded-up door cellar tombstone dr. jacob tess freudstein front hall . bob little red-headed girl friend who keeps warning him how bad house ( though no one else sees her ) . furthermore , people keep claiming dr. boyle town before non-existent daughter ( which he denies , not totally convincingly ) . he also seems some secret relationship babysitter , anne , who starts unboarding cellar door middle night . lucy seems either recovering or suffering serious psychological issues . got ? good , because half stuff never gets explained . only things get worked out little red-headed girl identity identity killer ( neither which hard figure out ) . there some nice visual moments earlier parts film ( fact killer one normal hand one rotting hand , photograph changes each viewing , mannequin gets beheaded starts bleeding ) but fulci ability handle gore moments disappoints . he lingers too long over some deaths , makes killer so ridiculously slow snail could outrun him bits like babysitter head falling down stairs come off funny rather than scary . compared injury eye scene zombie or christopher george chopping through coffin cotld , dr. boyle chopping through door around his son head feels like self-parody . fulci other films incoherent plots , but rarely way seems work against plot ( dream-like nature city living dead seems appropriate given prophetic dream heroine gets mystical nature threat ) execution setpieces usually fantastic . house cemetery neither thing working its favor . it not hell living dead-level bad , but fact it some genuinely good acting ( especially paolo malco , who plays dr. boyle ) interesting set-up almost make flaws worse . also , this version " never before seen deleted scene " , but it no sound just extended reaction shot after bat attack	-1
there seems several films regarding this one . story corruption property deals , story fathers their children , tentative romeo juliet romance course martial arts guns . those who like cross-culture , " romeo must die " , you ! jet li who fresh " lethal weapon 4 " really delivers this action-packed movie . playing han big one him . aaliyah(1979-2001 ) , rb sensation really got her acting chops gear playing alluring trish o'day , who shadowed bumbling maurice , played funny , anthony anderson , but i personally would hoped more michael wong less anthony anderson ( his constant ' dim sum ' refrain quite irritating ) but actors act , plot moves film enjoyable enough . i'd enjoyed x-ray effects movie whenever fight going happen . i liked part when han refused fight woman , he used trish fight her . it looked more swing dance me . since trish words backed him up , enemy impaled through heart . after final fight , trish father ( delroy lindo ) , wanted meet han himself , i ' glad he got chance , i think it silly him demand handshake him , but hey , he wanted who " cat " , make sure he . han never declined any offer only know who troublemaker behind " war " . before anyone remember seeing aaliyah " queen damned " ( which i personal dislike ) , look into this film first . i love jet li , but this film not good ' kiss dragon ' but better than ' one ' ' cradle 2 grave ' but inferior jet li hong kong movies .	-1

i liked this movie lot better first time i saw it ...... when it called " star wars " . i really liked scene where eragon looking off into sunset . boy , how original . i haven't read eldest , but i'm assuming princess eragon sister . this correct ? i wondering when han solo going show up , then course he . i also like scene where eragon take detour go cloud city rescue princess . then she tells him its trap . i expecting villian say , " magic strong you , eragon , but you're not dragon rider yet . " i hear writer only 16 when he wrote this . big deal . lot aspiring novelists writing stuff 16 . it never gets published reason . their brains not fully developed , they don't enough life experience absorb their influences reshape them into something original . i think this definately case here . mozart wrote his first symphony 5 years old . we never hear one , though , we ? way , aragon one main characters lord rings . its like this kid isn't even trying original . changing first letter , but leaving name phonetically identical not original	-1

i my little pony fan since they first came out 80 . i collecting newest generation ponies mlp-themed merchandise add my old collection . i all cartoons movies so far g3 , first few quite corny imho , but they got progressively better . princess promenade good story line kept even me ( 26-year-old woman lol ) interested see what happens next . animation quality well-done ( except expected little mistakes here there ) songs not annoying like most other cartoon singing , characters very likeable . only thing still lacking g3 movies some kind enemy . my favorite episodes 80 pilot special which very well-done bad guys while still not ' violent ' . i think adding few darker characters would add alot contrast interest storylines . one thing disappointed me princess promenade ' spike dragon ' . i remember spike 80 cute , scruffy-voiced baby dragon such great character him . i not like way he drawn this film , or his ' proper ' personality . i miss good ol ' 80s spike . so why i gave it 4 instead 5- spike favorite character mine old cartoons , it upsetting see how they changed him . but it still great film , those who new mlp wont notice or care change . previous g3 film ' very minty christmas ' also very cute , so check out well . i look forward next film when we finally unicorns- especially since probably means there'll unicorn mlp toys released well !	-1
actually paid good money see this local cinema ! went good friend who real fan stokers novel , before i even got say word she already asked , " what hell we just watch , because it wasn`t dracula !

world war ii , channel islands taken over nazis people who'd lived island before then pretty much left their own devices . they didn't military protection because it wasn't priority send forces protect one island . inhabitants basically two choices : stay or go ( evacuate ) . series open , you see families faced reality these tough decisions . some ( most ) send their children away " put up " other families . some adults leave well , including jewish shopowners who simply hand over their keys trusted friends who remain behind island . some cases , husbands wives separated there other scenes parents standing dock , watching their children hauled off what seem very small boats ( my heart my throat watching those scenes ) . i found all this fascinating , relating wholly dilemna families who stay or go , deal indignity taken over country - or pain leaving it all behind , not knowing if when you'd see your home again or what would left when you returned . all this builds up actual occupation island , which starts out bloody massacre docks , planes flying overhead strafing innocent people then ... strange calm after ( awhile anyway ) . there forced politeness german officers met political officials island but animosity mistrust both sides clear . things move fairly slowly after germans arrive , building tension bit bit . alliances formed some germans families but , other cases , divisions cause painful repercussions . movie focuses primarily few families this allows close-up view what they may encountered . one couple strained marriage tensions rachet up during occupation -but they also , times , see each other new eyes . mostly , though , this film reveals how " fuzzy " things truly become during war , how morality twisted values changed ... or how some people rise occasion become better . there isn't false note this one . my only quibble ( it minor ) some parts seemed overly long , some dry spells events . but overall this movie fascinating i learned something part history which i really knew very little . i'm grateful i got opportunity so .	-1

9 years ago , i patient renfrew 2 1/2 months . program different then than it now however it what i needed time . when i myself go into treatment , i not focus " cure " or " recovery " because these only definable struggling individual . probably greatest thing i got renfrew idea self-empowerment . i able turn my fight staff use it fuel my fight my ed . i think film made clear how incredibly hard it deal treatment insurance . studies shown little bit treatment worse than no treatment all . usa health care really needs reassess how they decide fund treatment . however , one thing film very disturbing . some scenes staff talking patients hte vitriol , lack empathy , some ways , lack understanding quite clear i ask how such attitudes might ultimately affect everyone . one point , one staff says " [ she ] bad seed .

excellent movie czech republic ( czechoslovakia till 1989 ) . story revolves around cellist called louka ( zdenek sver�k ... handsome sean connery ) who despite his virtuosity only plays funerals . louka middle-aged , single promiscuous flings women . he struggling financially gets coaxed into surrogate marriage russian lady . marriage trite business deal : russian gets czech citizenship louka much needed money . however , russian emigrates west germany soon she becomes czech citizen . cops smell fish come looking louka . things get even better when louka gets surprise baggage form kolja ( his russian wife son played andrei chalimon ) . kolja only speak russian , nowehere go louka forced take him . this marks turning point louka life . reluctant father reluctant son interaction hilarious , heartwarming poignant . one scenes louka prepares dinner tea kolja , who stubbornly refuses eat . despite louka constant urging eat kolja doesn't oblige . louka gives up , turns away dinner table hopeless despair . after little while he comes back dinner table find kolja finished hot cup tea . kolja taken louka . their bond gets stronger they get close each other . louka even manages get his ex-girlfriends sing lullabies kolja over phone . suddenly , louka finds immense sense purpose his life . however , life takes turn his russian wife comes back west germany take possession kolja ( she isn't staying ) . kolja leaves his mother . louka lonely person once again , but transformed . movie very artistic some best scenes movie not dialogs , just powerful silent expressions gestures . better part movie shot beautiful prague ( city brimming stunning architecture , paved streets , magnificent bridges beautiful people ) just adds movie appeal . movie alludes velvet revolution , but didn't capture my attention all . this movie relations letting other people , music leading simple purposeful life . masterful acting zdenek sver�k andrei chalimon	1

both sets reviewed many times so i am making mine short point . vol . i ii both thematic ( i . deals places -- famous world cities ) ii ( best ) involves events . best two entries " circus " shows chan first time his large family 12 ( it grew 14 later series ) deals murder very unpopular circus owner . " cc olympics " amazing piece work . #1 son ( great keye luke ) contender nazi occupied berlin olympics . this premise it own ( even it great subplot ) makes this one best oland series . none chan francishe films ran more than hour ( 70 minutes top ) , so both sets containing 4 discs quite expensive ( although fox reputed spent $ 2,000,000 restoration ) . round out set sidney toler wwii outings released mgm -- chantology ( which far cautious due times -- series moved studio monogram ) . if you real fan , then all three pricey sets worth investment . i tried buy them used lesser price . beware ! once you start watching series ( unfortunately many finer outings lost their copyright only available poorly made homemade bootleg dvd-rs ) , you get hooked most famous oriental detective ( based real life honolulu detective ) all time , amazing charlie chan . great series best genre .	1
i don't usually spend money dvds , but i love first six seasons this show . sci-fi channel regularly plays re-runs , but when price season 1 dvds dropped $15 , i couldn't pass it up . special price may something quality dvds . one episode , you can't hear anything apophis says , two other episodes skip alot . despite flaws dvds , i still gave this 4 stars . it great tv show i am very happy i one season dvd play anytime i want . i'll watching see if prices other sets drop , too	-1
let me make this very clear . i am not woody allen fan all , but i love this movie . humor , music , acting ... everything this movie first rate . it made me nostalgic time i didn't even live through - that how effective this film taking you back era radio . oh , i also don't usually like films led child actors ( " home alone " , shudders ) , but seth green ( who 12 or 13 years old when this made ) phenomenal . so , even if you , like me , don't much care woody allen films , give this one try anyway . i think you'll very pleasantly surprised	1
movie suggested lytton strachey fine essay gordon appeared his classic eminent victorians , indeed story brewing long time before combination international interests unleashed khartoum english speaking world . it time when olivier , newly remarried surprised father young family , desperate money wouild snatch up any job , so film world brightened , if that word , olivier appearing any old movie if they gave him enough lucre . it if he saying , i repertory thing thirty years , it time payoff . thus we got extra helpings ham bunny lake missing , shoes fisherman , battle britain , really any old blockbuster . it rare 60s movie didn't room olivier it . he never good any them , but khartoum his performance mahdi causes enough offense nearly justify , years later , recent subway bombings london . russet makeup smeared over his face ( slightly different shade than blackface he used othello ) , olivier bites every piece scenery known man , playing rhe mahdi mad tyrannical prophet islam , like westerners fantasy al qaeda , hollering white men blood letting his strange fantasies allah cloud his limited intellect . next him , gordon ( charlton heston ) almost looks like sane man . maybe filmmakers making some sort antiwar statement . this distance it hard say . what we see pretty frightening , there over top then there over top mahdi	-1

fan mme . austen , thomas hardy , d.h. lawrence other sundry novelists manner , i freely admit hopeless addiction " period " pieces -- romances , particular -- this weakness clearly plays into very generous aforementioned 2-star rating . " northanger abbey " charming bit camp rainy afternoon , but please don't expect this movie anything like big-money hollywood adaptations mme . austen other works . acting over-the-top ; soundtrack , deplorable ; characters ( exception eleanor ) completely unsympathetic . catherine portrayed insipid half-wit , rather than day-dreamy post-adolescent verge womanhood . peter firth henry tilney vascilates compassionate , brotherly concern annoyingly superior arrogance . end movie , i lost all patience them convinced henry catherine fully deserve misery they inevitably wreak upon each other . ( this romance buff ! ) most give up before end film , but true austen fans enjoy parade costumes , witty repartee , opportunity daydream regency culture . watch it or don't -- but if you choose watch , make sure you so sense humor forebearance .	-1
gah . judging earlier descriptions this box , i thought it'd uncut billingual like other 4kids dvds . it not case , so no dice	-1

i saw shorter/santana this tour , still t-shirt prove it . it awe-inspiring moment music history . santana doing his brand jazz-rock fusion since ' 70 , but taken detour into pop world . santana " lotus " " caravanserai " masterpieces , not mention carlos ' work alice coltrane . reviewer quite obviously not his homework , leon " ndugu " chancler worked santana 1974-1976 , * before * joining weather report ( chancler weather report 1975 ) . santana friends wayne shorter many years , recorded " swing delight " shorter 1980 , which may bit ambitious fell fairly short their potential . however , any professional music reviewer truly believes drummer chester thompson switched keyboards this tour bumbling idiot . chester thompson , keyboard player , playing santana since 1983 , well * major * name hammond organ players , main keyboard player tower power 10 years . chester thompson , drummer , played weather report one year , 1976 , but long-time touring drummer genesis . he great drummer , but he'll never keyboard player level his namesake santana band . this tour amazing feat , while shorter much richer history jazz-rock world than santana , their playing seemed perfect complement each other . i eagerly await next time carlos decides take such risk leave comfortable pop world explore jazz textures shorter . santana also performed kickin ' version miles davis ' " silent way/it time " , which former written future weather report keyboardist/leader joe zawinul . weather report/shorter connection goes much further back much stronger than our friend sam would us believe .	1

i , like so many its fans , cannot understand what minds critics time who bashed this film . no , it certainly not quiet man , thank god . ireland reflected ryan daughter not your quaint , leprechan-filled stereotypical place beloved world doesn't know much real ireland . atmosphere this movie haunting disturbing reflective great deal irish life , particularly time revolution against british rule . attitudes narrow-minded villagers realistic line church-dominated lives they led , irish great begrudgers so their jealousy lovely daughter local publican quite believable . however , this story young woman married respectable kindly older man but yearning romantic love takes greater significance when it addresses deeper issues involved : retribution , redemption , forgiveness , betrayal loyalty . love scenes sara miles christopher jones , playing shell-shocked british soldier who arouses desire she kept under wraps , some most intense moving i've seen . when they become enmeshed village suspicions , prejudices hatred english , all set against backdrop brooding rather sinister irish countryside , tragedy set place . this riveting film filled outstanding performances , beautiful scenery universal themes . robert mitchum particular outstanding what may his best ever performance , one very much against type . , course , there ever-present star show , ireland , incredibly beautiful land saints scholars , informers patriots , martyrs conspirators . this film add your collection .	1
this movie made back 1975 where it seems everybody jumping one person bed . plot pretty thin . this guy entrusts warren ( without soft focus lens dick tracey ) look after his girfriend . warren plays hairdresser so this guy makes incorrect assumptions warren sexual orientation . i think this movie would made better documentary warren sex life however i give it 5 stars some reason which i can't quite think right now because it 110 degrees outside here hot australian summer which kind fries my fragile little brain	1

idea behind story well acting three main characters both overcome actual plot this movie . it recieved higher grade then i would given it because acting , i almost wished i could seen it pre 9/11 well post 9/11 , just see how i would react differently . last night first time i've seen seige , it surprising . maybe not great , but surprising . i think what got me most how terrorists didn't care their lives , just they don't over iraq . long message clear word got out , they continue doing what they doing until message listened . movie , it amazing see hollywood depiction chaos would ensue after such act . especially since this before real incident happened just same way.at parts , i wishing less unnecessary plot points , well some them come together better , but whole , seige it job .	-1
this movie just bit fun ! acting , directing production values very good . maxwell caulfield makes excellent reluctant hero john rhys davies injects humor into his villanous role . medieval setting more convincing less glamorous than many movies i've seen . script pretty good , dragon eggs land like comets earth , but we aren't sure first ( neither characters ) what they . even though movie not bloodfest , it too scary children . dragons kill people , there fair amount suspense , dragons frightening	1

this nostalgic bit filmmaking 80s . sights sounds inimitably 80s . however , this sort enigmatic film . much it part 80s it seemed lack chic timeliness those days . i don't know why but david caruso one actor who i remember indelibly connected it . every time i think this film all i remember caruso screen presence even though he minor yet disquieting character . steven bauer very good gives heartfelt performance . barbara williams seemed rather detached added obscure feeling this film john getz performance well . bauer , williams getz remain no more than shadowy figures upon recollection , while production design , cinematography story remain imbedded psyche . story interesting disturbing same time i wonder who really thief hearts this tale giving film ultimate conclusion . i think douglas day stewart directed only one other motion picture he primarily screenwriter . film ambiguous style seems bolsters fact . film very provocative mix sensuality , sexual repression seems represents era when introverted self gratification glossy lifestyles replace traditional intimate values otherwise loved ones . interestingly , this film seems strange allure it leaving indelible impression once viewed .	-1
many thanks reviews here . whear , arlan ebel , mickey moose 15 . this amazon reviewing its best . read those three their entireties . what stands out me after watching this movie seductive wholesome portrayal santa rosa . time also given this film nostalgic value , deepening american romance small-town life . details all work make us feel comfortable this town , down traffic cop who knows names whereabouts everyone who lives his town , severe but helpful librarian , lovely white house its big porch lawns , dinner scenes where all ( girl ) children help their mother serve mashed potatoes . further we move time this movie , more powerful its image innocence becomes . contribution co-writer thornton wilder ( our town ) very evident here . perfection location makes arrival uncle charley ( played brilliantly joseph cotten ) all more ominous . ominous what this movie really good . outside santa rosa all confusion , shown when panicky young charlie unable locate her rescuer ( detective jack graham ) any addresses he left her . ties santa rosa rest america remain tenuous . end , battle good evil seem get resolved , but allusion " crazy world " outside santa rosa last scene , reminds us this resolution not meant felt final . there " ghost world " outside comfort santa rosa its physical double , just uncle charley shadows young charlie . it world where film significantly begins even if it not where it ends . sum , beautiful white house both front stairs back one . it hard forget seeing shadowy figure uncle charley through window those back stairs , which also become young charlie preferred way ; it because he knows she use them her uncle almost able kill her those stairs	1

i really took ' very bad things ' when it came out ' 98 , i watched it other day friend ( not seen it since its run theatres ) , i found i still esteemed crazed entity unique fervor . i think what most commendable ' very bad things ' , least person like myself , this actor peter berg directorial debut . not its technical virtues , which it possess , but because berg created picture such grim ferocity , holding back so little , most dangerously , entering directing world product , its neccessity , going receive near unanimous criticism its " distaste " . here thing ... despite sensationalistic way film approaches most horrific circumstances , i find ' very bad things ' almost brings within me sense empathy because , all all , five main characters film -- group old friends -- not bad people . seriously -- how many groups genuinely decent guys take vegas buddies ' bachelor party ? furthermore , they inherently despicable because they're getting loaded , snorting cocaine , generally acting like crazed little boys night event ? oh , but one them pounding prostitute -- if none other characteristics qualify making someone evil , surely this one must . well , not me . large , these guys appear likable middle class schmucks , stuck so many within half-baked life . where many find them unlikable without hesitation , i empathize because they all flawed ; once favreau soon-to-be wife introduced ( played bitingly diaz ) , it hard view him much more than pathetic noodle , completely subserviant witch behind beauty . then you've got piven stern , playing two dichotomous brothers general disdain each other personality complex ; piven lively but lost , single apathetic towards his career , probably acting bit younger than he should , while stern , contrast , responsible but neurotic ; uptight family man who no easier respect given his life accomplishments anal behaviorisms . leland orser reclusive , enigma shy guy doesn't offer much look up , christian slater demented complex made up handful self-help books easily most pathetic five . basically , these guys all normal some senses but completely deprived others , before night begins their descenting journey into madness , none them , my eye , could judged despicable any justification ( okay , so maybe slater could , judging real estate selling scene ) . film fateful climax , i pretty fond entire group . so , then , you've got premise , my mind ; awful accident occurs hotel room vegas , prostitute no longer living . thing , it wasn't anyone fault , unless you seriously blame piven act ( if prostitute wasn't responsible taking part circus act ); simply devestating accident . yet , because nature how system tends work , accident could still prove bring down more lives consequence . perhaps if they weren't all coked up , their decision making abilities might steered them better direction . nope -- they high kite , scared abandoned baby . essentially , point we see them make one mistake after , usually out survival instinct , no means rendered act . so ensues suffering paranoia all , reaching snowball effect until film finishes . if you ask me , if these guys weren't relatable or capable likelihood , film wouldn't last beyond intial moment chaotic hysteria ... but it . throughout most it , film expresses nice emphasis exaggeration , lends some comedy dire consequences proceed . but , many said before me , ' very bad things ' doesn't really seem like comedy . slater character , his outrageous justifications their nasty acts , comes highpoint exaggerated comedy . yet , it surely no drama , sense melodrama least . rather , it just detatched , furious account bizzarely interesting but fatal situations , up ' till this point , people who've never encountered such fearful , life-altering experiences . combined berg energetic direction , overall , impressive , convincing , intense performances -- wavering seriousness comedic ( my favorites piven , stern , orser diaz ' ) -- whole thing just ashamedly entertaining . it just . what else i say ? i think highly moral people might shun film , but anyone knack fatalism oughta really dig ' very bad things ' . abuser only abuses because he abused . while this might seen cowardly , i think we all , least secretly , view many things such angle , especially if events such hit us or those close us . indeed , we all whim great magnet who , this case , just happened cause asian hooker slip wet bathroom floor , letting her head gracefully plow through towel hanger wall . it dark it twisted . it ugly , sure . i myself no issues people disliking it , least claim not judge them it . i just hope those who fact repulsed least attempt understand why some may like it , not judge them unrelenting way many seem judge film , which sometimes seems near likes possessed demon	-1

i've after this movie while , but put off , people telling me it no good , various bad reviews i've read etc . after bad day work , i found it very reasonable price , nabbed it . i'm glad i now , surprised when i didn't get yelled buying it :) this film very strange , very ott storyline , not much it makes sense person who only bought film see her favourite actress angelina . i quite shocked start it discover , wee geeky guy girl next door , paul dano . ( who quite nice looking guy when he takes his glasses off . ) film starts him befriending guy , then pushing him front truck . it snowballs there . what puzzled me most this film , lack decent characters it . ok , angelina fabulous ever , actually suited her character , someone who kinda psychic , see what happened dead people etc . oliver martinez ethan hawke horribly miscast , just plain horrible too . i just don't find french accents sexy ( despite fact most time he very little say film ) , it just me , or anyone else find ethan hawke very rat-like ? charming image i know . kiefer sutherland i thought suited role he , i've only previously seen his blink-and-you'll-miss-him role phone booth , he comes across kinda guy - suitably creepy . ( haven't seen 24 . ) angelina gets her kit off this film , so if you want good look nearly everything , then guys , you'd better get this film . i dread think how long she spend makeup this scene , cover up her numerous tattoos she . some say finale this film let down , honest , i didn't think so . oh my god !!! finale your face , totally unexpected , i couldn't believe what happening . it made up certain other points movie lacking , although i jump out my seat least 3 times , screamed cos there some scenes where you get such frigh t.t his basically must-see any angelina fans . she plays marvellous part this , i actually enjoy film , definitely watch it again	-1
a.i. one those movies caused much divide viewers ' opinions , many varied reasons . it certainly movie multilayered seen many levels . me , a.i. holds special place my heart . it masterpiece ranks alongside those movies experienced rather than watched lingers long time ( it still after many years ) . it hauntingly beautiful one power touch emotional resonance what makes you truly human . like shawshank redemption ( one my other favourite films ) evokes power friendship , hope redemption ; a.i. evokes power dreams , love reunion . both films utilize universal theme possibilities completion through journey life . , i am sure , like other viewers suggested , this film revisited again sometime future seen different ligh t.t he acting excellent , especially haley joel osment david also jude law gigolo joe . also worth praising this film musical score john williams . me , it confirms him greatest movie score composer history . main theme soprano hauntingly ethereal , both sorrowful soothing same time . piano score like lullaby evokes memories childhood innocence purity . ** warning : spoilers here if you not watched movie !! **the movie android boy who programmed ( his little silicon soul ? ) goal love his human parents ( this particular case , his mother ) , simply , loved return . that all . but , unexpected happens when their once incurable human son cured returns them so effectively causes his mother , monica , abandon android robot . so , this where real journey begins : level abandonment , loneliness absence love . android boy , david , begins his quest return motherly love again but travel through dangerous world search clues fulfill his grandest wish . many viewers suggested this film too long final 3rd movie should cut , so david never realises his dream loved his mother . but , my opinion , missing whole point this movie . david programmed goal love loved his mother . his `program ' reason his existence . human terms , it this heartfelt dream love gave him meaning living , only following his dream would it ultimately bring him home happiness peace . it david unwavering faith eventually fulfilled his dream ( complete his program ) , course , helping some advanced mechas . 3rd act , me , completes cycle life ; not just a-to-b ending ends bleakly without meaning . if you cynic , materialist , believe stories metaphor no real meaning , love no power striving dreams no value , then pre-3rd act best where you leave this movie . me , 3rd act moves beyond limitations physical level onto philosophical , metaphorical spiritual level . david gifted temporary resurrection monica so he complete his goal . how ironic ! first , humans play god create machines . machine gradually becomes more human . humans regress become more like machines/or animals . then finally , advanced machines play god recreate humans ! david not only finally fulfills his mission loving loved his mother , he also , through journey life begins android/machine evolves into what it means human : through abandonment , loss love , hope reunion , unwavering strive one dreams faith no matter what impossible `physical limitations ' against you . love lost but regained one most blissful experiences humans this what david eventually experiences . it his emotional experiences relationships humans transforms him . very act loving loved return makes him human . he realizes truth told her end : he `always loved ' . time space ( even 2000 years ) no power over his dream love loved . although initially seemingly futile , reality it only temporary barrier proved completion his goal , he finally able what machine cannot : dream . transformation machine human finally transcending condition finally reach ultimate truth , me , what this film . again , how ironic it it takes `machine ' teach us what it means `human ' . end , david returns home `where dreams born ' ... realm eternal , spirit soul ? it bitter-sweet ending . bitter physical ; sweet metaphysical . way , you know `ai ' japanese actually means `love '	1

first off , this not sci-fi film where it all clean cgi . this real life film real dirt ground . there lot grain but only if you look it . looking ground battle resides where you discover true abilities hd . level detail surroundings overwhelming brings more realism viewing experience . colors saturated , but it might intended way . sound all over place bullets wheezing ricocheting everywhere . not mention this one best war movie date	-1
this movie when it hit theaters not begin receive attention it deserves . fine acting , exceptional cinematography , great plot genuine surprise ending leave you saying your self " ... cool . " i loved this movie . it honest creepy side would bring goosebumps , story passion long lost love , imperial intrigue all set victorian era austria/prussia . this total adventure should not passed up . i heard others seeking compare this movie prestige - don't . prestige okay movie - similar period setting , but transparent plot . it all too easy figure out how it would end long before it . illusionist so much more offer , my opinion much , much better movie when compared . if you enjoy fine acting ( paul giamatti , edward norton more ) , superb plot , surprise endings ( make sense true revelation ! ) , then add touch supernatural creepy-ness , victorian era settings all masterfully produced directed , this film true feast . truley cool film	1

this my second favorite john woo movie great touches action drama , when i first saw this film ( 5 years ago ) i wasn't used seeing this much violence screen ( i thought lethal weapon extremely violent time ) i shock more then once my jaw dropped . this film very violent but compared other action films this really tame nowadays . minor points this film would some bad acting some worse acting some spots , some weird cuts editing , subs terrible , same audio quality some camera work bad , but this john woo first ( if you count heroes shed no tears ) landmark heroic bloodshed film so we all know he could worse much worse . yun fat chow , ti lung leslie chung their good moments bad moments , most good moments goes chow ti while leslie only one or two moments . plot like this cop must confront his criminal brother . that it . if your typical hollywood action goer this your perfect find . but i said if your new heroic bloodshed films don't make this your first one , i'll say stick killer hard boiled few weeks then move . but if your hollywood action movie goer make this your first if you handle it move other heroic bloodshed films so . this film big landmark action genre even bigger landmark underground action genre . i really recommend this film any action fan !!!!	-1

don't believe negative reviews . i repeat : don't buy lukewarm responses . if you looking uninterrupted gut-busting laughter , audience laugh-track cajole you , you might better served pryor other movies or works artists like sinbad , chris rock , dave chapelle , bernie mac , george carlin others who followed his footsteps . " here now , " which roger ebert called " 90-minute documentary one man talking , " richard pryor evokes cadence relevance none above could reinvent . he rises gift genius talent savant . make no mistake , this film contains some pryor best moments . yet these moments not justice superficial label " comedy . " when pryor ties his arm off shoots up heroin , wincing intensity he stiffly pauses waiting hit materialize , then transitions into liquid shiver euphoria before his entire body falls limp -- it might disappoint those reviewers who expecting see moe , curly , larry . rest us spellbound power poetry man who comedy what jack kennedy politics ; rare achiever stifled too young not paralleled since . pryor masterful , ad-libbing sketching us roller coaster laughter , tears , pure marvel human condition . those who buy this appreciate cheap thrills rather than intellectually politically prepared moved , i say this : " you're no richard pryor .	1
i love these kind films go way beyound what we're used . monster house one my faves because it somewhat scary because it just treat watch . it actually spook factor some scary movies lacking . house alive ! owner crazy mean takes bikes balls little children who so much step blade grass it lawn . it calls little children night . house isn't afraid cops sucks whole cars into it teeth . movie also hysterical humor clean original . what starts out movie freaky house freaky owner ends up actually teaching us small life lesson we actually care animated characters . if you liked toy story then you definitely love this . this would also satisfy scary movie lover because it genuine thriller- but animation .	1

this very ... very ... very ... uh ... well ... interesting dvd . let see ... how i say this uhh ... it sucked . i'm type person who usually loves everything i watch , i love almost every genre its easy me like things . especially anime . if i say anime bad ... its pretty dang bad . this anime 2 siblings who win 2 legendary skins online game , . hack . they won skins 2 legendary characters who beat game . even though sister excited ( her skin black rose , yea , you know who i mean . hack video-gamers ) , brother ( he kite skin ) well ... isn't excited . it just pretty lame show insults amazing video games other . hack anime which masterpiece . if you really -- i mean really -- want check out this series , i reccomend manga ; it much better .	-1

these guys playing basically same songs last twenty years . but they still look like they're fun ( unlike stones other bands should retired long ago ) put great show . fleetwood buckingham best business , bar none . rendition " tusk " they give here dynamite ; i love happy faces fleetwood makes when he plays because those same faces i make when i listen him . lindsey going nuts , jumping dancing around like loon priceless . i give four stars only because this : i accidentally put disc two before disc one too lazy get up change discs . disc two just so freaking awesome disc one little disappointing . but i still watch it - just not much second part concert . i don't care if they're still touring when they're walkers . if they keep putting shows like this , i'll keep showing up . i only wish i born decade half earlier than i so i could seen them their heyday	-1
i really enjoyed this movie . let my sister borrow it she her boyfriend really loved it well	-1
now , this real anomaly : mae west starring film based successful play she wrote back 1926 . so theoretically , this film could made into silent movie , here it , turning up over 50 years later 1978 . even these more enlightened times , they didn't use original title sex , calling it sextette instead ( although opening credits put first three letters into slight relief those who might otherwise missed it ) . i'm big fan mae west , i finally let my curiosity get better me her final film , which i warned against many times . happily , i thought it delight beginning end . mae west unique history sex stars movies because she able somehow both play role sex goddess simultaneously parody same role . so while other sex queens could not gotten away doing such role this one age 85 , mae much more than " get away it , " even this age it not all parody all time . allowances made very few things . her wig one them , her slightly bizarre makeup makes her eyes seem way too far apart , her slow movements time time final one . still , she obviously taken very good care herself over years , gets show herself off one point series beautiful gowns ( keith moon over top her dress designer ) she supposedly prepares herself screen test . she clearly lot fun . film set up so she consistently deliver one-liners made her famous . these one-liners still work her , some 45 years after she used this technique her first film . ( line " girl who works paramount all day . . . " probably funniest any her one-liners . ) i sat there huge smile my face anytime mae onscreen . i would consider her inspiration those who feel after they reach certain age , it time give up . mae west just effervescent zestful here she her 1930s films . her co-stars quite good , dom deluise leading pack , followed closely ( no particular order ) tony curtis , ringo starr , george hamilton , alice cooper . i hope i forgiven thinking timothy dalton , who makes up final member sextette title not quite their league ( way , " sex " latin " six " i suspect original title more this than it " act " ) . then again dalton playing straight man all these buffoons , so his part little less showy than theirs . also , his singing voice decent although he could stand some lessons phrasing ( not breaking musical line partway through phrase ) . speaking singing , mae three numbers through course film . she makes winners out all three both through her singing voice ( remember she even creditably sang opera 1935 goin ' town ) through force her personality . now , this something we would missed out if sextette made silen t.t here number star cameo turns . it fun see regis philbin way back when ( i didn't realize he well known 1978 ) , it trip down memory lane see once-ubiquitous rona barrett , bit bizarre see one ed beheler playing jimmy carter , something he apparently made minor career out ( even some gop campaign ads ) . probably most touching cameo george raft , who played lead mae first film , night after night , 1932 . course mae loved surround herself bodybuilders , she gets scene number them here . these not just guys they picked up off street ; they all athletic credentials or hold titles such mr. america , indicated closing credits . okay , so gone wind it not ( hence 4 stars instead 5 ) . it still lot fun , it great see mae west go out such grand style	-1

look past surface this movie it really loneliness , range consequences around " falling love " someone you don't know . yeah , characters debauched , stupid things , but it all related their need " connect " someone . all them make mistakes , none them happy end . other reviewers mentioned , this isn't film everyone ; there several gross-out/desperate sex scenes , but they work context movie . i don't much more say hasn't already said ( said better ) other reviewers . i'll finish up adding if you went small , liberal arts college where everyone knew everyone , everyone business ( i ) , trust me , you " know " most people movie probably get weird combination nostalgia " thank god i'm past part my life ! " when watching this film . also features great 80 soundtrack probably best use cure song movie ... ever .	1

no , this movie isn't ' so bad its good ' or anyything stupid like , it genuinely entertaining . i think least three things ended up funny , but , if real people similar situation , probably would happen , such guy who acidentally pricks himself tranquiliser while attacked , which realisic considering he panicking his hand box tranquiliser darts . thankfully , aside horribly overused ' get out water!' line , movie avoids any clich�s , unless you count character who acts surprisingly like steve irwin , which i doubt counts clich� since steve irwin actually real guy , although it strange so many australian characters monster movies act like him . i guess this going last time while though , because it going something taboo long time . while cgi creatures monster movies always some amount cuteness , jurassic park movies , where ' cuteness ' accidental result cgi creatures extremely stupid-looking , more recent movies , where it seems intentional , title creature possibly cutest cgi movie monster . i know fifty-foot crocodile swallows people who shouldn't able cute , but it . i guess this sign how anime tokusatsu influenced western culture over last decade or so	-1
i saw most this movie my children ; they watching little afternoon tv while i cleaned . i pretty surprised see content wicca religion , wicca songs earth wind fire sung " nice girls " vampire teeth . they made it sound like , " oh we wicca , there nothing wrong !

" i agree reviewer it should clearly stated this movie it contains content wicca . i only saw it tv , which i could turned off . what those who spent their good money it found out later it includes positive teaching paganism .	-1

oliver twist one dickens orphan novels , this film adaptation , david lean excellent job capturing feel despair protest against social conditions novel depicts , namely difficult , dilapidated situations those employed workhouses 1830s london . also , this film works show people general , especially those little monetary means or sustenance , succeed life find hope despite rough upbringings . film visuals camera work extraordinary . opening scene quite illustrative , we see pregnant woman walking across field storm approaches she barely able make it work house give birth son oliver . after giving birth oliver , she dies , oliver twist left there work exist little way food . scene shows point view sick feverish oliver who slowly fainting while standing before judge pickpocketing . conditions which oliver lives harsh . after coerced his fellow peers while workhouse , one day he asks more food ( famous ...

i never believed i could cry criminal . i always assumed they prison because twelve strangers said , quot ; guilty . quot ; movie , visit , took me not only inside prison walls , it took me inside prisoner heart ... heart most people outside never know , not even father . it took me inside prisoner thoughts he looked me through my television screen . i felt guilty my own freedom . i saw his eyes what i felt many times , sadness person who deserved more , person who not heard , person who so much begs freedom but only look through cold steel bars . this movie gave me sense what my freedom really means . freedom choice every day your life . you don't go prison prison . i cried tears this man could not part . this movie lesson life	1

that mostly what you need know movie - it intriguing notion . vampires recently announced their presence world , now they serum take instead drinking blood . nsa cop steven grant understandably upset this after his partner killed vampire , especially when he teamed up vampire cop aaron gray . however , they slowly reach uneasy truce start work together figure out who it killing people , since vampires actually peaceful people who find murder distasteful . way , gray introduces grant beautiful lucy westerna grant finds himself falling love . we meet some other very memorable characters - character west , who apparently slavic , looks sounds irish , interestingly enough ( i guess it because he slavering revolutionary ? ) . one most amusing things this - me anyway - overtones 1984 constant announcements nsa headquarters ( " open hand not grasp discipline " " nothing true , everything permissible " ) signs ( " informing your enemy makes him your friend " " one step forward 1/2 step back " ) ; not mention people dressed decidedly soviet military style or 50s style , everyone smoked all time . cinematography beautiful ; whole film washed out , creating almost black white effect , while retaining some color . all vampires quite pale , course , but other than their fangs , they really aren't so different - even children . acting pretty good who wouldn't love grant sexy voice ? ok , i'm fan vampire genre so course i'd like it ; but also this gave us different look world i enjoyed it thoroughly . if you like vampire flicks all , you'll love this one	1
i pleasantly surprised find movie current interesting it when it first came out . brilliant director talented actors contributed , but most important , , script , still fresh very much point . one not quote any more " greed good " because it politically incorrect . but , believe it , it still rules wall street corporate world . latest news selling america proves it . i recommend this dvd without any qualms .	1

i seen many takeshi kitano films , but this one haunts me especially . it very poetic , sad , beautiful , complex . what you say yakuza film begins serene , tender paintings ( kitano himself) ? kitano gives probably one his better performances here , playing yet version disillusioned cop , but more depth this time . this not say his other films shallow ( quite contrary ) , but here emotional resonance makes this film even more moving powerful . yes , it violent , but all kitano films , he doesn't wallow it , even though it brutal . i've always liked everything this man ( even his comedy kikujiro , which got terrible reviews ) , this probably my favorite his films .	1

i picked up this movie bargain bin decided give it try . boy , am i glad i ! this story tense strong . both scott wolf tim roth play good guys , it just they're motivated different things . roth sees wolf character " man he could " takes hit job personal vendetta . then , time progresses he takes new mind set , his outlook changes you find yourself rooting more his character than wolf . but there no bad actors this film . i never party five fan , but wolf acting here nothing short amazing ! story ends little too abruptly ( major plot thread left out there ) , but i still very satisfied movie when it over . way , it gets its rating mostly language ( there not really much ) subject matter serial killer . if they'd just toned down couple words , this could easily passed pg-13 . strong , compelling story hold you until film over . recommended	-1

edward lionheart shakespearean actor who more ham than talent . his plays savaged london critics , who now denied him great acting honor . he shows them error their ways . vincent price plays lionheart one his most effective slightly campiest roles . i say slightly campy because price actually effective job showing lionheart sympathetic manner , his reading shakespeare ( when he not doing it lionheart stage ) good . diana rigg lionheart daughter , edwina , psychotically effective price . lionheart sets out prove his critics wrong dispatching them ways drawn shakespeare plays . among methods , one set up kill his wife jealous rage then taken off ( othello ) . one upended butt wine ( richard iii ) . one pound flesh removed ( merchant venice ) . one stabbed hacked death crowd ( julius caesar ) . funniest ( slightly sickest ) reserved meredith merridew ( robert morley ) , who first finds great pleasure his two poodles he loves dearly ( titus andronicus ) . those who enjoyed this scene , i highly recommend julie taymor titus anthony hopkins . among actors playing critics , addition morley , some britain finest : dennis price , jack hawkins , harry andrews , michael hordern , several others . price known now , i suppose , hammy horror specialist . he made lot money enjoyed himself immensely doing it . but guy could good actor . i thought he very effective shelby carpenter laura . occasionally late night cable you see samuel fuller movie called baron arizona . price excellent it . i think theater blood first-rate movie , but it best enjoyed if you passing knowledge shakespeare plays . cliffs notes always it me . movie camp , witty , literate gory . nice combination . dvd transfer very good	-1

this remarkably good film one history great men . this film features above-average acting storyline reasonably true history , rather than hollywood puff piece . film begins caesar confrontation dictator sulla , ends course , his historic assassination senate . thing i liked best this film my opinion it fairly realistic look julius caesar . it mostly not try glorify him ( , example , colleen mccullough her masters rome series books ) . nor it demonize him . film shows caesar went gaul provoked wars mainly his own political purposes ( enhance his stature home ) when senate sought call him account , this what motivated him turn his army against rome essentially overthrow roman republic . these not necessarily laudable acts , film not gloss over these points . scenes caesar imperiously dictating harsh laws proscriptions senate show time his death , absolute power indeed corrupted caesar absolutely . film much better attention detail concerning roman parapernalia such lictors who attended roman consul , other similar details . purists appreciate this . excellent quality this film casting acting , both excellent . acting generally good . jeremy sisto criticized his portrayal caesar , but i thought he reasonably good job . richard harris absolutely nails role dictator , lucius cornelius sulla . christopher walken fine cato , although this not major role film . heino ferch very convincing vercingetorix ( king gauls ) . i not think jay rodan convincing mark antony . overall , though , this film surprises performances its generally excellent cast turns . this film sufficiently good , fact , one why it not " bigger " film . i not enjoyed film much this one several years , causing it merit 5 stars . sets , acting , dvd reproduction this film all excellent . this film satisfy those us who seek historical accuracy film one history great figures , but storyline similarly engage those who simply interested good dramatic entertainment . this one highly recommended	1

what ---- . " tale revenge " ? why everyone their review say ? b/c it written box cover ?? this interesting compelling movie , but w/ very odd , abrupt ending leaves you hitting " rewind " button saying , " what minute , it over ?? i miss something ?? " afte watching this , i scoured internet , wikipeida , amazon ... still no reviewer seems able say what meant ending this film . my takeaway it -- she going hang , die ( go heaven ); he going stay earth .. but maybe when they meet again ( heaven ) , they get married . ?????? how come no one else come up w/ definitive meaning end this film ? subtlety great , but not if it so damn ambiguous nobody universe seems able define or explain what this film all . it not revenge . maybe it love obsession sadness silliness despair . sorry , can't really recommend this one !	-1
i finally got round watching this history channel last night . it screened part black history month , which october here uk . it powerful piece filmmaking . movie barely started i already feeling its power . scenes brutality injustice black people endure during civil rights movement , combined mournful voice joan baez singing " birmingham sunday " just too much . tears came easily . i immediately knew i just it dvd . spike lee earned oscar nomination this documentary 1997 . i think he should won , ( statue went mark jonathan harris " long way home " ) , i think this possibly one most significant movies he ever made . he surprises avoiding firebrand rhetoric he known he tells this story how four young african american girls murdered white supremacist bombers back 1963 , without voice-over narration , opting instead story told those who there ; namely girls ' friends families , civil rights activists who birmingham time . using these interviews , some which joyful ( those who prefer remember girls way they lived ) , some which excruciatingly painful ( those still grieving their loss ) some which verge ridiculous ( namely , former alabama governor george wallace - you see it believe it ) interlacing them archive footage , lee firmly establishes segregational fervour hysteria existed birmingham , alabama 1963 . bomb went off september 15th year we given run up significant events preceded act devastating consequences followed it . it made very clear how denise mcnair , cynthia wesley , addie mae collins carole rosamund robertson died while it made equally clear ( comments bill cosby , instance ) , how world much poorer place without them . more significantly - although this probably never give girls ' families friends any solace - it strongly suggested their deaths acted catalyst led upward surge civil rights movement south , black vote end segregation . one man eventually convicted murders but his co-conspirators never caught . critics denialists often question point looking back , raking over past , opening up healed wounds , blah , blah , blah , but i'm one those firmly believes regardless our skin colour , we cannot possibly know where we're headed if we don't full picture clear understanding where we've come . i felt sadness , bewilderment anger watching this but i also felt lot pride . this important history lesson . let all those who ears listen .	1
first all , director mr. robert . webb quite home westerns so he delivers job . ( " white feather " dvd still one my unfulfilled dreams ! ) . robert ryan ( he great here ! ) mayo ( girl past ! ) they're perfect match romantic mature affair . well , since this one released 1956 , one can't avoid notice some " coincidences " or maybe " clich�s " regarding other famous western movies : 1 . " high noon " ( 1952 ) - consider main idea - marshall alone face hired killers . arthur o'conell/lloyd brigdes play similar roles , denying help first but reconsidering later . remember kid first only offer help cooper/ kane . 2 . what say howard hawks ' " rio bravo " ( 1959 ) . same conflict . only help comes ex-bad girl hotel ( feathers/angie dicknson ) , jail keeper - same good old walter brennan extra hired helper , colorado ( ricky nelson ) who also brings girl eyecandy - jeffrey hunter - they even dress alike . only jeff more familiar gender . jeffrey hunter , fan , i've watched many his movies i think he didn't so well while playing such divided character thad anderson . when he grabs mayo hotel room , he totally not himself very far gentlemen type , unreproachable person he ( won him part christ kok ) . he pushed too much particular scene results so unnatural . other hand , there no doubt his unic presence screen adds plus this - time - western . nowadays , however , this might one best re-releases last two or three years . 3 . rio bravo bad guy name burdett here we saloon owner named barrett . 4 . let not forget city drunks paul . burns/ dean martin . if you compare you'll find more resemblances . but point " proud ones " 1956 while " rio bravo " release 1959 . oh , yeah , someone said richard widmark jeff already played same roles or similar characters " red skies montana " ( 1952 ) . sum up , who cares originals when we all these amazing actors , cinemascope great colors amuse us . buy all those dvds , watch many times you enjoy yourselves while you find out which one best performance . still say : there isn't single bat , spider , mummy , +fast or +whatever beat films like mentioned above . not even all gd " effects " world	1
o'henry stories legendary it seems appropriate topnotch , legendary cast led top directors time should come together present these five shorts . since other reviewers good job iterating history credits these films , i'll simply add few personal comments . some mentioned uneven aspects couple these films , mentioning some stronger than others . this i say o'henry wrote different voices . his stories each their own , his topics mixed varied . i suggest viewer enjoy each story what it completely unique others . most wonderfully each story introduced john steinbeck , my favorite most admired american author . what treat . extras round everything off very nicely . terrific dvd .	1
sure , retail price four cds together $240 so $180 sounds like good value . except amazon selling first three cds $30 apiece fourth $41 which only adds up $131 . why world would someone pay extra $50 just buy all four once ? cds themselves great - no problem there . i just think someone amazon marketing division went little wonky this pricing no one caught it . seriously - save yourself some dough . until price all four cds drops below cost buying them separately this no bargain	-1

these words follow these next few paragraphs going seem snobbish boisterous , if it offends anyone , i apologize . yet , i cannot all my mustered soul , say i liked rollerball any way shape or form . if given opportunity walk hot cinders gasoline drenched feet or watch this horrid science-fiction , heavily symbolic film again , i would choose first . gasoline isn't bad , it ? muttering un-impassioned lines lead actor james caan , " your face " symbolic nature film , all way random unsolved moments johnathan his estranged wife , we ( viewers ) left nothing but sloppy film reeks symbolism deeply involved masses old sci-fi film only cult status because it released mid-70s . nothing more , nothing less . those sit here argue it huge film due visuals , elements strength government , power one man topple such corrupt way living , i cannot buy it . what i witnessed i watched this film nothing more than campy sci-fi film attempted smart 2001 , but instead just seemed recycled director norman jewison reading too much into " 1984 " " fahrenheit 451 " . i don't want sound like i hate intelligent cinema , when fact i crave it each every time i place film into my dvd player , what i don't like cinema blatantly symbolic just because it knows it trying reach opportunity thought cult film . rollerball , i feel like scenes too contrived overall nature it attempted represent . this needed simple film resistance against controlling government all tightly rolled into game known rollerball . jewison adaptation , i felt game rollerball got wrong end stick . i didn't feel like there enough time or dedication spent game . what really irritated me this film scenes games which tried look artistically like kubrick film , but failed , but also didn't enough cohesiveness hold film together . jewison could not " connect dots " our characters when they not roller rink . i mentioned this before , but i couldn't keep my eyes open long enough when caan spoke because he mumbled his lines ( providing little no emotion behind his character outside fact he really roller skate ! ) could not guide us through tunnel . central character , i felt he wrong fit this film . we needed someone strong , yet ability demonstrate verbally what they doing fight corporation . i also couldn't follow scenes party , scenes caan maud adams , eventuality moonpie . jewison left us guessing wanting more , but instead answers he would just throw us back rollerball game . it cheap move , i felt cheated him this film . end movie i saw some opportunities chances jewison didn't take , it angered me because this film could great , but every level it just fell short . i read other reviews say caan excellent choice this film because he represented aging sports star very well , but me he just fell flat . his acting , especially his speaking , seemed mumbled unemotional . i couldn't tell if he actually doing this fight corporation or just because jewison behind camera yelling " action " . i know caan capable so much more ; i just don't see why he didn't feel need give everything this character , unless he didn't see value him either . final scenes him moonpie laughable best , it just made me consider this film stronger emotional actor instead just your typical " man man " helmed this project . same said cardboard-esque representation we witnessed maud adams . emotionless babble . if jewison didn't us watching very loud mundane game rollerball , then he forcing us turn our volumes up down trying listen this emotionless babble coming mouths our actors . why didn't jewison get better actors ? i couldn't tell if it acting itself or direction just fouled this film . also , why 2018 look quite bit like 1975 ? if this where world headed , i need ask my father couple articles clothing ! overall , i cannot sit here recommend this film anyone . i read other reviews , i notice growing trend . you either going love this film or adamantly hate it . i seemed fall latter category . i willing give this film chance because i admire science fiction projects , but my hatred towards sports themed films got best me . there not surprises this film , there apparent lack innovation creating future , overall , game caan played wasn't great . i watched one match trouble watching rest . it seemed tedious boring view spectator . i realize hidden deeply within this symbolic references towards violence , media , corporate rule ... but honestly , if you would rather see film demonstrated better , you should check out oliver stone natural born killers avoid this film all costs ! thankfully , i remake here home watch later tonight . i know it horribly worse ( which seems impossible ) , but least it eliminate any remembrance i this utterly diabolical 1970s piece cinema . this definitely not one records books . shame you norman jewison ! grade : * out ****	-1

ramones raw basically marky ramone handheld camera annoying johnny , joey , dee dee c.j. while tour . there some great live footage band playing some classic songs . dvd doesn't really tell story but more narrative ramones life road . inner relations band not touched upon all . fact , watching ramones raw you'd never know johnny joey hated each other passion . most running time lighthearted gags inside jokes interspersed concert footage . complete look inner workings band , well making most their albums , pick up end century dvd it much more comprehensive look band whole . recommended ramones diehards completists only	-1
one my early saturday morning favorites kid . i get up watch fireball xl5 ! it also big topic discussion play playground during recess . robert robot favorite . while it may seem lame today standards ( computer graphics animation ) , it great its day though it rarely given any credit , it influenced science fiction series followed . great way jog memories baby boomers ! i just wish they would sell individual dvd show or least " best " dvd some better shows , like they " best thunderbirds " . this set may little pricey casual fans who just want show their kids or grandkids what cool when they growing up .	-1
i no intention watching this movie , none . there nothing it i thought i would like , but when friend mine wanted rent it , i nothing better , i watched it her . i wrong . i should wanted watch this one . it best understated , definitely overlooked . there few places where it bit ' out there ' me , but all all , i totally blown away how much i actually liked this movie . not kids . fact , probably not all adults , but if you like things little out ordinary , truly relate some more basal darker sides human nature , this sure send chill or two down your spine . there beautiful image love unrequited this movie , almost poetic nature , but so obscure it hard grasp it entirely . i consider it like i would work art , not everyone going understand it , nor everyone going get same things watching it , but i think it worth watching	-1
great escape portrays heroism prisoners never giving into their captors pompous honor nazi germany . group becomes monkey wrench all turns determined send their adversary russian front . my only complaint it shown letterbox format which saps some power story . wasn't this picture worth full screen format ? but this probably par epics era . stars carry load bigger life even though you peeking through window . steve mcqueen man epic tales this one not fail deliver . even doomed failure he never gives up . resist every last breath motto prisoners . guile guts served them well end germany defeated even if only small part escapades escapees . grit abounds through fiber every man sworn serve allied forces . we owe these men debt we never repay , but always respect . it takes courage put your own well second behind cause . unfortunately we seldom triumphed glory since time . this war made sense while successors seemed steeped politics . something normal person hard time understanding . let just hope global war put rest this one . we look back great escape admiration gratitude . but we never repay what sacrificed these men	1
out everything i own , this movie one sacred me ... this one my fave .. i've seen it countless times ... it great cast , great director .. willem dafoe amazing it ... i'd say out all movies he , i'd rate this one his best ! not best movie edward furlong though ( lt ; -- i'd say t2 him ) , but he played his role well .. ya gotta love danny trejo ... he great every movie . this movie pretty realistic ... i mean it written actual convict .. edward bunker ... there actual convicts movie extra , not mention trejo ( who real con well ... special features this movie explains this , gives interviews ... special features awesome .. ) . if you like this movie , look into some more works edward bunker , especially his books , " education felon " etc ... i can't express enough how great movie , so i'll end my review here ... if i could give this movie infinite amount stars i would , cuase it good . when i searching copy it , lowest it sold $30 , that what i ended up paying mine ... but i ready pay $50 it ... it definitely worth whatever price it sells ..	1
this arguably herzog greatest film . fact he not only finished film under most trying circumstances ever faced film director ( only apocalypse now comes close ) , but film true spectacle , amazing watch awe inspiring . kinski perfect fitzcarraldo , madman who wants build opera house inquitos natives . he wasn't even supposed film , but jason robards got sick during production , leave film . herzog carried kinski , notoriously difficult ( but brilliant right director ) actor gives role right amount passion surprising grace ( especially end film ) . location shooting superb , but when you see ship actually moving up mountain , you completely awestruck . even though you only see it move few inches , those inches feel like miles . this film should seen tangent burden dreams , because it makes you appreciate scope herzog achievement . this grand example herzog filmmaking , one most imaginative , daring films ever made ....	1
i never thought movie criminals could dumber than ones " dead presidents , " but kidnapping-for-drug-money plan this movie absolutely worse . soon i saw where this movie going , i just shook my head watched idiots go ( i'm talking characters -- not real actors ) . this movie pretty silly me . timberlake absolutely terrible thug , two people forewarned me this , but i figured i'd see myself . every time i heard him curse glanced his tattoos , i laughed louder . his friends even more entertaining ; bunch suburban kids who thought kidnapped cool ; guy so high out his mind he didn't realize up down ; ransom kid who so excited " criminal " scene he completely seemed forget he danger . i don't know where movie stores put this one when it comes out sale , but it really should go into comedy section . scene where they go " buddy , buddy , buddy " made my stomach hurt laughing goofiness . i'm sure that'll copied off high schools everywhere . thing actual plot story ( different actors without druggies ) would've great ; but people who played roles absolutely so out touch point where it looked like i watching vanilla ice video , or something close it . i would've given it more stars if movie meant parody drug dealing , but previews , it sounds like company going drama . cons : i could've gone without hearing constant racial slurs this movie . it annoys me when people culture say it ; so it definitely annoyed hell out me hear several characters use certain words . i didn't find all funny .	-1
it not best episode though it crowning piece . not best because there far too many too long battles which quite repetitive effects . but it essential episode understand or extract some meaning this fantasy . vanity human king turning criminal since he tries burn his surviving son , who he not like , alive . hobbit frodo who entrusted mission carrying ring back into pit hell also shown vain somewhere his mission . vain because he believes he entrusted this mission because he special , though fact it mission going make him future somewhat special . vain too because he not understand he cannot succeed alone . there help sam dramatically shown essential fulfill his mission , not betray it , not let some kind disgusting giant spider deep caves earth distract him rob him ring , which it actually , not fall into pit himself underground traitor ring . but lesson more us than hobbit himself since he not seem learn his simple lesson very easily . main lesson batttle only won when everyone , including dead come up fight . this inclusion dead into fight makes it slightly spectacular allusion jesus other saviors who go down into limboes or hell some salvaging adam eve or euridyce . but meaning - film - comes some strong imagery used fair level insistance . world cut two . dark forces evil one side whom ring returned order destroyed , all others representing light . contrast light darkness , underground traps , caves tunnels open air countryside , blue sky very dark grey if not black sky , more or less civilized use fire good side its evil use bad side . final battle front black gate looks like wall finally crumbles sinks into ground end like some other wall fell 1989 . only modern vision since when books written wall question not even stand . since then this image turned around since two walls built but no longer forces east or north , but forces west , one palestine other mexico northern border ( case north not supposed bad side , yet ) . history twisty times . books written during cold war they represent this vision time world cut two , black white , etc . this today changed too this simple splitting reality two not correspond reality though it still very active minds people who still think lot either/or line . so today , what used reflection cold war fear becomes rather simplistic we experience everyday how this approach world life leads catastrophes other swampy situations . end this third episode return peace quiet turns slightly emotional not say sentimental or even sentimentalese . too much crying indeed too much sadness compensated joy peace , love couple weddings . altogether it brings tale end but it not reach height second episode , though we see some inspiration recent series field fantasy , harry potter who links modern world this underground fantasy world like stephen king dark towerdr jacques coulardeau , university paris dauphine university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne	-1

lucio fulcis zombi 2 my opinion greatest zombie movie ever made[dawn dead close second]and should every horror fans collection . people say its rip off romeros films , but doesnt every zombie film take something night or dawn dead . romero basicaly created whole undead zombie genre . fulcis picture actually quite original . setting tropical islands south america very effective . zombies look amazing , much better than romeros blue shaded gut munchers . fulcis zombies rotting , decaying monsters . each one its own original qualities . only thing i dont love movie pacing . it takes like 40 minutes film get going , but once it get going its nonstop zombie gorefest . speaking gore , zombi 2 plenty it . wooden splinter through eye scene this day one most infamous gore scenes ever put onto film . if you havnt seen this movie then you should first punch youself face then go buy it immediatly .	1

my vote most underrated film 2002 tuxedo , bittersweet romance starring jackie chan jennifer love hewitt . chan stars jimmy tong , lovable misfit who owns antique bookstore . hewitt plays del blaine , bookish college student insatiable hunger word-puzzles . jimmy ( understandably ! ) enchanted love-inspiring curves coed lush body . though initially reluctant , del eventually swayed asian bookseller quirky charm ... his wardrobe ! jimmy woos his beloved aid confidence-enhancing outfit title . its second act , film turns into road odyssey . jimmy convinces his best friend rex ( played joe namath , former quarterback los angeles rams ) travel across country him search j.d. salinger , legendary author franny zooey . one film most endearing delights salinger cameo , his sole on-screen appearance . touched grace style , salinger resembles latter-day cary grant or silvery jimmy stewart , silver fox who win anyone over twinkle his eye . final scene candlelight dinner olive garden . when stars kiss , it clear chan more verve than men half his age . electricity two leads undeniable	1
this excellent movie all formation , training , ultimate disastrous ordeal under fire australian horse dragoon 1915 during ww i . mel gibson mark lee play two main characters , different backgrounds but similar their patriotic fervor superb running ability . movie three parts : first takes place australia where gibson lee introduced become friends ; second cairo where they train ; third gallipoli where they eventually slaughtered , thanks poor british planning failure british commanders muster up take initiatives when they became available .

well .... i just recieved this disk i very high hopes ... let me say , most met .... but there couple things i got tired real fast ... first all , if i wanted see many crowd shots , i would bought " dancing party people : movie " .... i would loved see disk mostly man himself giant screen background ... would cool ... show me what it like crowd , not crowd itself ..... there couple quick shots chapter 14 , min into chapter show perfectly what i mean .... my other complaint man himself ..... he really comes across butt-load full ego .... many , many , many instances him striking " jesus christ pose " ... all my years going parties , i yet see dj this much he during this set .... other than those complaints , i nothing but praise it ..... i not checked out special features yet , just movie itself i truly dig it ... music top notch , quality picture sound supurb .... although this may not mean much , seeing how this my first review , i fully recommend this disk fans electronica everywhere ....	-1

" 2001 maniacs " , my opinion , only type horror movie that really , really hard get right 2000s : horror-comedy . everything else under horror banner - monster movies , ghost stories , psychological thrillers , slash/carnage-type horrors , etc . - all them lot great representatives recent years , all over world . there humorous moments number horror greats - " freddy vs . jason " , " final destination " series , " bruiser " , etc . - but almost all attempts full horror-comedies , my opinion , stalled - most them would better picking one style or other maybe trying inject little bits other instead walking line directly ( i admit i haven't chance see " slither " yet , but one look promising ) . " 2001 maniacs " huge success horror-comedy though , reminding one greats like " re-animator " " evil dead 2 " so gloriously plowed fields outrageously bizarre . three groups young travellers - least two them heading off popular spring break destination - take wrong detour end up surreally odd town where it still seems pre-civil war old south , eve large annual festival , populated characters ranging merely odd ( sometimes likably so ) truly disquieting . locals familiar cars modern technology but just don't seem any ; travellers assume this all tongue-in-cheek re-creation old south , charmed enough overflowing hospitality some town residents ( including its gregarious mayor - wickedly played robert englund ) they decide ditch their previous plans accept invitations stay weekend enjoy festivities . wincing but overlooking truly tasteless parts ' re-creation ' , they settle what looks fun weekend all - until things start take creepier more threatening tone ... talented cast turn what could really stupid , crude comedy into something really flows film just enhances its weird vibe . several characters , judging their first moments movie , could turned out so excessively unlikable drag movie , but too averted you get know them . robert englund global treasure - he plays this role pefection - he almost all his movies - knows precisely what bring each moment . " 2001 maniacs " bloodily inventively violent , unpredictably quirky , sexy enough exposure keep both guy girl viewers happy . well-made unorthodox , it welcome addition 2006 rich horror offerings	-1

this 1984 performance " eugene onegin " kirov just marvelous . when they're their game , nobody performs russian opera like russians , this performance sense real occasion . it hard know where begin praise - voices , characterization , sets - they all terrific . all four main singers young , good looking , excellent stage presence , inhabit their characters superbly fine voice . drama very real here , everyone inside their role , even smaller parts . there not wobbly voice bunch . none old fashioned , curdly-voiced female singers use inhabit russian performances too often . sergei leiferkus poised , dark onegin , even gaining one sympathy end . tatiana novikova lovely , lyrical soprano radiant tatiana , totally believable both young ingenue later gremin wife . larissa dyadkova joyous outgoing without going overboard olga , yuri marusin impassioned tortured lensky . prince gremin famous love aria act 3 , sung nikolai okhotnikov , so poignantly it practically brings down house . staging traditionally , best befits opera , lovely costumes beautiful , evocative sets would hard match . glorious ! unlike first two amazon reviewers this video , i thought picture sound just fine . fact , balance voices orchestra model clarity , both well projected easy hear . conducting yuri temirkanov ( who not mentioned kultur dvd presentation ) quite broad very poignant , yet he all requisite drama fire when called . temirkanov particularly good transitions lyrical dramatic subjects . kirov orchestra very fine , special kudos first horn . chorus dancers must also receive special praise . good russian choruses special ring them so right this music , dancing ( this , after all , kirov ! ) joy . among few mostly insignificant caveats some excess audience coughing , some minor picture flutter distance shots , tendency film too much dancing too far away . nothing get remotely boil . this dvd classic status written all over it . easy 5 stars	1

steve railsback stars this imaginative different sci-fi film alien vampires . i first saw this when it came out liked it because it so different . special effects predate cgi , they not incorported into film , where films strength lies . moreover , plot itself extremely interesting suspenseful . steve railsback american air force officer assigned astronaut program . he only survivor his spaceship . when he lands back earth emergency pod , search what happened crew , what happening earth . there strange occurances beginning happen london , people beginning turn into vampires . aliens space made earth their giant blood bank , race destroy three aliens who landed earth . film very good , leaves you susense . i really liked way director , tobe hooper , used alien vampires film . different treat time . i recommend film , parts which dated , however , this not detract films suspense or thriller element . recommended . it definetly worth watch .

someone who practicing pilates quite awhile now , i am always lookout short pilates workouts which appropriate my intermediate level ; i also prefer my pilates videos mainly abs-focused . happily , this 20 minute overall body workout fit bill perfectly . although it purports full-body workout , it actually concentrates mainly abs area , some back work thrown counterbalance . also , performed instructor amy brown , this workout definitely intermediate level ( " beginner workout " referred dvd case simply amy assistant , liza , showing modifications , not separate workout ) . workout begins pilates breathing reclined position . then amy moves what she calls " hundreds " but which different version this exercise than i've ever seen before : she simply breathes her legs air her head up . fact , throughout this workout , amy adds many unique variations traditional pilates matwork , such doing twist while holding teaser . i also found sequencing exercises very different what i've come expect pilates . example , right after hundreds , amy goes into criss-cross , rolling like ball comes fairly late workout . however , i thought sequencing worked very well , especially amy tendency balance out series abs moves some brief back work ; i liked this lot . there only one side-lying move , but because i prefer abs work , i didn't mind this . thing i liked this workout pacing : amy higher number reps than you usually see pilates workout , but pace never rushed . other hand , this workout moves steadily no down time exercises . amy concludes workout few neck stretches , which i absolutely loved ! overall , i found this very enjoyable , thorough pilates workout , i know i get lot use it	1

" sealab 2021 " great show . fifteen minute episodes regularly managed pack twice many laughs your run-of-the mill half-hour sitcom -- it fast-paced hilarious . this season itself , however , show started going downhill slightly ( i think ) during episodes found season 3 set ( although " red dawn " " craptastic voyage " still couple my favorites ) . ( final ) episodes these season 4 dvds continued this trend , show just not quite good its last few episodes . however , this one some good stuff -- i liked " shrabster " lot , though i don't think all my fellow fans agreed one . we all agree , however , " cavemen . " , course , none episodes bad " der dieb " ( probably least funny episode series ) . if you haven't seen " sealab 2021 " yet , yourself favor pick up season 1 first -- it best ; you'll laugh your head off through " stimutacs . " this one completists , but they'll completing great show -- ya gotta love " sealab . " fignuts	-1
i hadn't seen this while until recently , it still me my toes . this came out when i high school , but i didn't see it until after i graduated ... but i remember hype it " racy " . i really didn't know what think it first ... but after seeing it few times , it grew me . maybe it sex ... or crime drama thriller ... killers getting away killing ... or combination above . i remember hearing reading stone mixed-review performance beforehand , but after seeing it myself , i personally thought it fit character . you never really trust her , although times you almost want . i hadn't even really seen douglas any movies before this . if you liked this , than fatal attraction must see well ( i didn't see fa until after this one ) . throw here beautiful score jerry goldsmith ( which classical musician i noticed ) , well what become one my favorite dance tracks since i heard it high school , la tour " blue " dance club scene roxy . far flaws , i agree reviewer realism her antics she getting questioned . what wrong these guys , what really makes her so special ? they really haven't seen anything like her , polygraph guy says ? that main thing bothered me , but it movie , long you know , don't take it too seriously . there lots funny moments , esp . curran friend gus ... " that magna cum laude ***** fried up your brain ! " i didn't know this same director starship troopers showgirls , but this far better 3 . i think this one those movies where you either like it or you don't . again , movies aren't always supposed realistic , so just appreciate it what it . some movies keep you watching it more than once , others don't ... you don't always valid reason why . me , this just one those movies :)	-1
here thing : northern exposure one greatest series ever grace airwaves . no matter what music playing behind it , it still same scripts , same actors , same plotlines , same energy cast , same spirit show . if you actually remember every scrap music played during original run series cbs , try this out : whenever you hear different music what you think ought there , just hum missing music yourself . problem solved , right ? would it nice if original music included these sets ? maybe . it effect show any way whatsoever ? hardly . it still brilliant show , dvds close we're ever going get original show . take what you get , folks , because they didn't release them all ..	1
shoddy amatuerish moviemaking combined appalling morals . unapologetically even brazenly rascist misogynist . pimping his own child just sleazy , sick criminal . i'm all open mind but appreciating this movie would require lobotomy . van peebles deserve couple stars honesty , no matter how misguided he may	-1
i watched this directors other movie " dancer dark " while i didn't like it , i felt it very different cookie cutter movies hollywood turns out , so i gave this movie chance 2 1/2 hours later i found myself wondering if director this movie anti-depression drugs or what ? this darkest most nightmare induceing film i ever seen . story young girl who marries finds love outside her faith , only her husband cripled , just not what i ever want see again . some may like it , but directors(in both films i seen)must fun around , both films kind leave you so dumps you feel(at least i do)unclean seen it ! i find myself hopeing this man finds himself some help , because he seems very down life all humans world . some may like it i said , but i'd watch 24 hours test patterns before i'll watch this kind downer movie ever again !!!!!!	-1

great military movie . it shows what airmen during vietnam war ( or american war , if you're reading this vietnam ) wanted - take fight enemy . great wish airmen come true big screen . retired air force member , i laugh all naval antics shore leave because today military makes them verboten . carrier landings bars angeles city or olongapo no longer exist since us military ordered out there . still , guys great fun letting loose this movie then faced death when time came . scene where willem dafoe his pilot avionics failure , it made me sit edge my seat , because former avionics technician who worked f-16s , i could feel fear subtle panic they facing during battle . i always ensured my avionics components worked so our aircrews would not experience sensation . note : captain , who trying aircrew disobeying orders , fred dalton thompson ; he wasn't mentioned credits some reason . great movie storyline , superb antics troops shore leave , really cool aerial footage . must add your war film collection	-1
movie really touched me because i five year old who some similarity boy movie terms innocence expressions boy . i found myself upset unfairness situation . first half film very good but i not wholly satisfied story . however , leading actress incredibly beautiful all aspects , it ironic although she lost sense she seemed know which important life . i liked very much way which her motherly instincts became projected care boy more so than real mother . it human story touched me . things matter life no price . story seemed true spite more incredible story transcended emotion	1
first i'll say this movie classic kung-fu movie providing everything you could ask , including : blind villianrandom fight tournamentone-armed heroflying guillotinemany different types fightersthe precursor dhalsim street fighter2booby traps one even two hit combosafter reading other reviews here i feel need talk quality dvd . i think lot reviewers way too picky their expectations . this freaking late 70 kung-fu movie made overseas budget couple thousand dollars i'm guessing . if you want see slick glossy movie perfect quality then rent jet li newest straight video movie possibly starring dmx . i understand quality could better , but who cares ? what you really expect when you buy this kind movie ? sure , some parts dubbing suddenly switched subtitles then switched back minute later , but just adds whole cheesy kung-fu experience . if this dvd wasn't good enough you quaility otakus then grow pair restore movies yourself . seriously , eat it	1
this very good movie i watched my " horror classics collection : 50 pack " ( asin : b0001hagtm ) i got amazon ( under $20.00 ! ) . so first off , i would recommend buying 50 pack where you get 2 other vincent price movies ( bat last man earth ) 47 other good movies almost same price buying this movie itself . far this movie goes , there few suspenseful parts you wonder what going happen . mainly , movie give you some memorable quotes , vincent price always deliver great voice his . all characters good job acting ( typist great scream ! ) . some parts seem bit unbelievable some questions don't seem get answered , but who really cares ? only 75 minutes long , this movie better than most horror movies come out today unoriginal go shock value . so while this might more murder mystery than " horror " movie , it worth watch you'll satisfied end ... unless course , you not like black white movies , if case , then you probably wouldn't reading this review . p.s. i love gary . taylor review when he says : " price plays it slightly prissy , very high-camp manner tremendous dose black humor which he so famous . " that so true	-1
i theory : audiences getting smarter . whereas before big hollywood movie massive marketing push would've all rage , now people starting know better . they're realizing terrible movie terrible movie no matter how often we see julia roberts deal more romantic comedic mishaps or much stuff michael bay destroy . so when movie comes like john malkovich , or memento or even visually impressive like matrix , we stand up take notice . building career largely inventive music videos , first time director spike jonze comes out gate probably most unconventional comedy you'll see . loserly craig schwartz ( john cusack , always good ) aspiring puppeteer who can't get any work . then he his dishevelled looking wife lotte ( cameron diaz ) leaving their small new york apartment pets everywhere since lotte pet store worker . craig , due his puppeteering skills gets accepted company located , amusingly , 7 1/2 floor , complete cramped ceilings . he also strong attraction one his co-workers , feisty maxine ( catherine keener ) . one day while working , he discovers small day going inside he finds out he see world through john malkovich eyes 15 minutes unceromonious dump new jersey turnpike ditch . craig maxine get idea : charge 200$ people experience john malkovich which novel idea until lotte goes through feels deeper connection , especially around idea maxine . then we bizarre love square or star or something since craig loves maxine who loves lotte but only when lotte inside john malkovich ... ' head . try not wrap your head around it since it better explained movie after awhile you don't even worry stuff like vessels or portals , you just go it . casting course important no one seems wasted , even diaz , who i normally can't stand . real treat though course malkovich since times you almost can't tell if he acting or if he really quirky . then there comedy which subtle first-was-funny-but-now-it-ain't like 7 1/2 floor small ceilings but then film shows you what happens when malkovich steps through his own portal it becomes not only technical marvel but one flat-out funniest things i've seen lately . only problem story certain point it shifts gears film almost speed walks its climax rather than lurching forward , like it shot foot . like amazon review says , i don't know if film warrant repeat viewings you get more out it every time you see it but first viewing quite something	-1

until i browsing through showtime television other night . i like robin williams , so i figured it worth checking out i'm actually really glad i . i'd never seen movie advertised so i didn't know anything plot . basically , williams plays man who known ' cutter ' . cutters take memory implants people brains when they die scan their entire lives make one hour or so ' remembering ' type thing dead person funeral . many people really like idea it , while others think memories best left remembered your own . there some indication picketing christian groups who think it against god use implants . everything william life surrounds one event , he unable remember clearly , but carried him guilt event , until one day , while cutting man who recently died , he see boyhood friend his it triggers quest find out where this man what happened him ... hopefully alleviate his guilt over even t.t urns out , he wasn't remembering things exactly way they happened . we lot human beings ... our emotions taint our perceptions , but one thing memory implants don't feel , so they record it exactly it happened . i won't reveal much more so not spoil plot , but i say movie good , but ending left bit desired . all all , it worth watch	-1

there no doubt this movie classic , after watching it once i could see why . after repeated viewings movie started grow me . movie isn't scary i though it would initially , however it still quite scary movie . i would certainly rate this movie amongst my favourites all time . some people say movie starts off bit slow drag places but i disagree . it start off father merrins story or else movie plot would make no sense . whole movie gripping harrowing . this essential view anyone who loves good gruesome shock now	1
bill maher one best comedians since back his old saturday night live heyday , but it politically incorrect later hbo show , it really sharpened his skills slash through hypocrisy , kills spin-doctors something you rarely see these days - common sense ! bill wears many hats , political analyst , formidable debater , social conscious political arena , religion world situation . you may not always agree him , but then maybe not bill aim . he provokes people think , look beyond garbage spewed media grabbers . thanks goodness bill caring , his determination not let us all get snowed under hyperbole , rhetoric flood misinformation , making us laugh while doing it	1
sometimes film version novel falls greatly short original material ( demi moore execrable 1995 re-invention scarlet letter ) other times motion picture rises far beyond story upon which it based : happily , this version last mohicans probably foremost example latter possibility . this simply among my favorite movies all time , how anyone fail swept up this one mystifies me . telling superior version james fenimore cooper hopelessly plodding 1826 classic , verdant appalachians north carolina standing 1750 new york book , there everything one could want here , violent war , tender love scenes , stirring score , panoramic captures natural beauty so perfect it little short sin show this movie anything but widescreen format . daniel day lewis , always captivating his performances , delivers central character , heroic white man raised mohican , hawkeye ( here re-named nathaniel breen ) who first leads band newly-arrived scots through danger british outpost wilds , then later after surviving brutal massacre , tracks woman he loves across frontier hostile huron village , where he undertakes courageous rescue . that course razor-thin description multi-faceted plot , but trust me , there more going here than i could easily describe review three times this size . this director cut took me moment appreciate , since i'd seen theatrical release so often vhs , but watched both versions now , i think there scope this release dvd enhances film even mega-fan like me .	1
when it comes sex there few basic positions everyone seems use . missionary , doggy , spooning , oh my favorite ... woman top . although video focuses basics , they build these adding variations each these well add seated side side positions . additional pointers provided hosts how prolong sex , how make sex better , well different techniques make your partner scream joy . filming tasteful . models attractive . presentation information straight forward . overall , i give this dvd 5 stars	1
up until today , i would given this wonderful movie , which we watched my spanish class , 5+ stars . but i not all like ending ; it very much ruined it me . i'm person who needs closure . yes , this movie demonstrating tragic topic should sad . but just cruel , end poor little girl singing how she so lost . we don't know her fate . i also felt roberto sort villainized character . he point gaby lose mother . i hope alicia , when she left , going get gaby . what i would like know what they decided sara , her possible grandmother . again , i need closure ! i expecting depressing ending , but not left hanging like this ! arghhhhh . i also problem gaby born captivity . it makes scene where little boys suddenly burst into her room kind pointless ; it meaningful , powerful , one my favorite scenes until i realized she just startled . i guess it still meaning , but , i dunno . just my nitpicky , i guess . i also want know who pedro . also , what gaby possible parents got them arrested . i realize it could something very minor , but it would nice know . all i know they all could gun-toting revolutionaries . overall though , it wonderful movie i am considering buying it myself . i especially loved scenes involving las madres abuelas de la playa de mayo . acting fantastic . i just am bothered all these questions never answered	-1

this movie gem ! modest success when it released theatres i think it found bigger audience since . julia robers , kyra sedgwick ( golden globe nominated performance ) , robert duvall , gena rowlands , dennis quaid terrific . it doesn't go happily-ever after ending . it balances comedy drama rather well ... callie khouri ( thelma louise ) should prouder this film then ya-ya sisterhood crap . great dialogue ! it movie remind you why julia roberts most powerful actress hollywood	1
i agree some previous reviewers : this matthew bourne his best : he genius story-teller choreographer . his swan lake become top notch variation classic ballet his recent nutcracker bound become same . those us who no chance ever seeing this production staged theater , this dvd not missed . i find watching it arousing ( full meaning word ) , emotionally shattering , ultimately cleansing manner classic tragedy . i agree others previous reviewers : nervous , mtv style camera work distracts dancing overall composition this brilliant theater piece . his commentary bourne offers sort reasoning hyperactive cutting back forth but it comes across after-the-fact attempt save integrity his own work . there indeed too many close-ups prevent viewer seeing dancers dance , just eye settles movement camera shifts . but i found second viewing i could watch sections dvd slow motion without sound track could see appreciate lot more bourne remarkable sense pattern movement terrific discipline energy dancers . i give this dvd five stars because this only version i am ever likely see even its directorial flaws it conveys high artistry erotic energy not only bourne reworking bizet carmen but also essence original opera . i think bourne work staying power we treasure his productions over years , above all perhaps magnificent swan lake . but where dvd his cinderella set wwii london ?	1

i love this movie few reasons . one those reasons i'm huge fan previous film ' whole nine yards ' which this serves sequel . next fact bruce willis one best underrated actors out there captivates my attention every performance he gives . third , biggest reason i love this film little scene where jimmy ( willis ) oz ( perry ) visit local pub get little ( or lot ) drunk . whole scene worth price rental . i guess since it reminds me so much myself my friends ( i'm emotional drunk ) whole morning after thing so way it would happen . all all laughs there , some forced gags bit cheesy . ' whole nine yards ' far superior film , but this sequel not without it moments bruce willis matthew perry great comic team . bruce tackle everything action comedy drama should recognized little more . this may not end up your favorite title but it won't your least . premise follows oz jimmy they try rescue oz wife ( jimmy ex ) mob boss trying get revenge jimmy . amanda peet plays jimmy wife whose fed up softy jimmy become trying tough contract killer jimmy once . there subplots twist end makes this more than no-brainer , but fact still remains film makes little sense ... but it doesn't really matter . just sit back , relax , don't think it enjoy it what it ... or least watch drunk scene , then pop ' whole nine yards ' really enjoy yourself	-1

this one greatest games i missed , 3 quarters anyway . i only saw 4th qtr wished i seen entire game . now i see this entertainingly high-scoring , last-minute affair many future nfl stars this dvd . previous reviewer stated though , video/image quality somewhat poor(the audio isn't great either ) . during some replays or image transitions , you see some pixellated images . closer you screen , more noticeable flaws course overall it definitely not up quality dvd standards . said , it still watchable visuals usually good enough most part color vivid if you watch it its natural 4:3 mode , it looks really good sharp times . ( note : i watching dvd 52 " rca hdtv-compatible big-screen philips 60 " hd-built tv . it looks better if you view it fullscreen mode , but i like watch it panoramic/ 16:9 view my big-screen , which unfortunately stretches images little hence extra pixellation ) . content , it delivers this area . * handful brief featurettes concerning university texas football team , emphasis vince young . * game its entirety , including pre-game bit ferrel/usc vs matt mccounaghy(sp)/texas . * get this ... two condensed , bonus highlights great game texas ohio state , blowout texas ou ! i not expecting this pleasantly surprised they there(esp classic ohio state ) . ( note : these highlights terrible bootleg-looking image quality , but still watchable)this how i would rate this release : 5 stars , if you loved game or love college football , you've got it your collection . 5 stars , if you're texas fan . national championship you won , plus bonus features including 2 other game highlights . 3 stars , if you loved game or texas longhorns demand only best picture quality available because it . this dvd let you down case . personally , i thought game great enough offset not-so-great image quality(which still very watchable imo comparable other releases this type ) . overall , highly recommended ; but i wish they would better job putting these dvd together concerning quality control	1

i now seen two judy garland movies -- wizard oz this one . all bets off third . i could go singing morbid distinction judy final film . she plays -- get this -- world famous tough-talking yet vulnerable vocalist tormented personal life appetite prescription medication martinis . quite stretch . overall , this movie confused hybrid melodramatic soap opera , london travelogue , " live " judy garland stage performance . it probably filed under " musicals " your video store , but that not really accurate -- nobody spontaneously breaks out into wizard oz-style song dance production numbers . instead , tunes performed judy alter-ego " character " jenny bowman pseudo-live sold out ( course ) solo shows london palladium . she sings handful oddly forgettable unremarkable showstoppers , including title song which features unfortunate lyrics such these : i could go singing , til cows come homeand rooster starts crow , crow , crowwhen i see your eyes , i go all out i must vocalizetil you shout " enough already ! " i could go singing , til moon turns pinkanything faust ink-a-dink-a-dink ! not even judy manage deliver this stuff convincingly , but she gives it her best sho t.t he notable exception little-known gem torch song , " it never you " kurt weill , which certainly deserves heard more often . there also some remarkable instrumental soundtrack music mort lindsey ( co-composer jeopardy theme song ) , especially zippy " helicopter ride " symphony experimental , ives-ian " matt dilemma " interlude . you get see judy son ( matt -- dilemma he doesn't yet know he judy son ) performing gilbert sullivan drag , if that kind thing you're int o.o therwise , jack klugman , dick bogarde , rest cast merely props judy stage , though kid who plays matt likeable enough chap i guess . dramatically , though , i could go singing awfully cornball , overwrought stuff , it all comes abrupt , unsatisfying conclusion . it also doesn't help mgm dvd cheapo affair no bonus features speak ( no , " theatrical trailer " doesn't count ) only barely adequate mono sound . grade :	-1

out seemingly endless amount slasher films released early 1980s , house sorority row stands out superior example genre . graduating seniors theta chi want one final party before leaving college facing real world . there just one problem . their rather puritanical house mother , mrs. slater , absolutely forbids them engage any activites involving booze , premaritial relations , drugs , or anything else made college so much fun circa 1983 . so , logically enough , girls react pulling prank unintentional result apparently killing old witch . unfortunately , mrs. slater bad manners die just party get started . what group up-and-coming sorority girls ? well , they basically end up dumping mrs. slater house filthy pool then go attend perhaps most uncomfortable party their lives . however , party gets going , they discover mrs. slater body no longer pool . , night progresses , girls start disappear one one unseen stalker makes its way through sorority house , armed only slater surprisingly sharp cane ... needless say , plot description doesn't really this film justice . however , slasher films -- whole -- probably most predictable genres . mark good slasher film it holds audience interest even though audience already knows pretty much everything that going happen . this task house sorority row easily accomplishes . whole , entire cast gives performances cut above what one usually expects this type film . if victims all pretty much types , actresses playing them all likeable rather endearing chemistry . though most them clearly too old just now graduating college , they believable group who friends four years . its own way , house sorority row almost becomes diner all female cast slasher subplot . all girls well but standout performances given kate mcniel ( who probably one best so-called " final girls " slasher film history ) , harley kozack , especially eileen davidson . vicki , instigator prank , davidson probably one most likeable " bad girls " ever . her growing exasperation just how difficult it cover up one simple accidental homicide borders both hilarious oddly touching . house sorority row directed mark rosman it his sure touch elevates this film above its genre . he protegee brian depalma obvious watching film smoothly executed set pieces which manage create level suspense absent most other slasher films . towards end film , mcniel must face killer while under influence sedative rosman shoots these scenes her point view psychedelic style threatens actually give good name psychedelic styles . all all , rosman creates sadly underrated thriller house sorority row	-1

i've fan alejandro gonzalez inarritu since 2003 ' 21 grams ' so when they aired `amores perros ' ifc few weeks back i just watch it . following same formula ' 21 grams ' inarritu gives us brilliant story interconnects lives three very different people very tragic event . we first octavio ( gael garcia bernal ) who living his brother ramiro ( marco perez ) his wife susana ( vanessa bauche ) . ramiro abusive cold this leads heated affair octavio susana . order make enough money two them run off together octavio begins fighting his rott money . we next daniel ( alvaro guerrero ) , tv producer who gives up his life his family order pursue relationship supermodel valeria , but tragic car accident causes their relationship unravel , their nerves get frayed their love slowly painfully die . last story trilogy revolves around el chivo ( emilio echevarria ) , homeless man who makes money hitman . when el chivo hired businessman kill his partner only find out his partner also his brother , he chance teach them both lesson learn something himself . it may car crash links these three stories , but it people within them , lives they live lessons they learn connect them such deeper more meaningful level . acting brilliant here , both bernal echevarria turning out award worthy work , truth told debut directorial piece inarrito delivers near flawless film	1

highest praise i give any movie , while watching it , i begin dread fact it end . i found this story enjoyable .... then some . lead character , ripley , presented well-aged version sociopathic con artist played matt damon " talented mr. ripley " . played inimitable john malkovich , this older , wiser ripley infinitely more sophisticated , sly , treacherous , fascinating . he lives wonderful italian villa gorgeous wife/mistress who knows embraces his true nature . when publicly insulted neighbor , played dougray scott , he initiates plot gain revenge , ultimately turning innocent man into hired killer who then tortured his own conscience .... punishment could never affect consciousless , sociopathic mr. ripley . malkovich unique actor , never content merely show up speak his lines convincingly , he actually becomes character ... every devilish smile , lick lips , flash anger , etc . becomes expressive action character , not actor . he so completely suited this role it impossible envision anyone else playing par t.t he dialog wonderful .... complex , intellectually stimulating , natural . indeed , some comments nature ( absence ) conscience guilt achieve level fine literature . conversations generally riveting , humor generally very dark , suspense reaches hitchcockian levels . scott character , who dying leukemia , sinks deeper deeper into depravity his hapless plight , he actually begins seek , rather than fear , death . this very sophisticated , emotionally involving story appeal strongly mature viewers . it never received attention it deserved , ranks among best " undiscovered " movies . i give it my highest recommendation	1
this stunning romance thriller . it breathes like hitchcock . after watching it i went back beginning film when jeweler asked max ( vincent cassel ) which three beautiful rings ( how he described them ) he choose . max think it we find out who he choose end film . he not sure his engagement muriel when he overheard voice his lost love lisa ( monica bellucci ) . there he must find her find out why she left him two years ago without word . he finds clues which may lead him unsuspecting surprise . music camera work excellent you follow characters throughout story keeps you thinking .	1
many us growing up , leonard bernstein * * american music . this excellent , thrilling pbs biography captures essence bernstein . he flamboyant actor podium , but it never seemed forced . his performances seemed intensify music -- he like speaker quot ; spinal tapquot ; went up 11 instead just 10 . watching this , you begin feel music-intoxicated bernstein himself must . this documentary doesn't whitewash his dark side -- substance abuse , ridiculous radical-chic politics , certain predatory sexuality , deep unhappiness struck him middle age ( after he world his feet . ) he turns 70 , you see dissipation written all over his face . but he man great musical gifts who changed american culture , this fast-paced video captures very well	1
not very realistic movie , but very enjoyable . whoopi almost her best . doesn't pluck heart strings like " color purple " , not moving " clara heart " , but certainly showcases her comedic talents . loved " silver box " " tropical fish " comments . some very funny parts require real acting talent . thoroughly enjoyable film best enjoyed someone watch it you .	-1

" i saw it american dream . he worked hard , dose luck , when it mattered , all heart . music strong movie . high school bands played " rocky theme " bill conti many years . watching rocky workouts , especially running pushup scenes , inspiring . mixed music , you might catch yourself suiting up hitting streets few miles after final credits roll . i fully recommend " rocky .

there really not much i add plotwise other excellent reviews here amazon . what i say though helena bonham carter often referred " queen costume dramas " which unfortunately pigeonholed her into some kind one dimensional charicature herself some eyes . well .... it henry james ' wings dove ( one better james " novel adaptations screen ) under very able direction iain softley where " mrs. tim burton " blossoms shows she pair eyes express complete range emotions without saying word . ( didn't norma desmond , great silent screen star sunset boulevard say , " we didn't words ... we said it our eyes ! " ? ) . though wings dove certainly fairly engaging story it own right ( it melodrama certainly follows some formulas ) , it miss bonham carter beyond-admirable performance makes this beautifully filmed streets canals venice tragic love triangle really worth watching alone . some actresses so fit bill their characters ( i am reminded meryl streep sophie choice fernanda montenegro central station , currently helen mirren queen)that ever consider remake down line some director would mean outdo what already perfection . bonham carter hit absolute career defining moment this film . here she not ingenue 1983 room view , but full come-of-age bonifide star who received both nominations hollywood foreign press academy . she deserved every bit those accolades role kate , wings dove really kate story anyway . supporting cast , linus roach more than suitable merton plays well opposite miss carter . i , personally , never found parts americans played alison elliot elizabeth mcgovern anything all . i truly feel miss elliot fails capture necessary fragility/emerging sexual woman role any kind true conviction millie theale . miss mcgovern , part limited best , but there not much there delivery nor look	-1

perhaps it success other , recent randolph scott westerns released this past year dvd , but now warner brothers releasing very reasonably priced triple-headers two 3-film packs classic scott westerns 1950s , it indeed great news fans classic " little " western , randolph scott , who many ways epitomized western star 1940s ' 50s . these three titles purchased together three more set pitance . although warner scotts not generally superior columbia products , they still superior westerns very entertaining , filled action kind dramatic adventure so treasured fans genre . several , including colt . 45 , fort worth , riding shotgun , very good . here hoping warner release carson city ( one best early 50s ) , sugarfoot , bounty hunter ... if they it , westbound , one seven budd boetticher directed scott films . i'd even enjoy seeing much-maligned shoot-out medicine bend ( young james garner) ! thanks , warner brothers	1

top fact it solidified steve mcqueen " king cool action " 1970 1960 . it always best not forget his more challenging films so much character development intimacy like papillon . i only wish this dvd more extras got better special edition treatment than it , but we all can't winners . nearly all mcqueen films got treatment past year or so , including my favorite bullitt . dustin hoffman early career proves impossible top graduate , straw dogs this well . i simply can't stress enough how great this movie , upon first view many years ago , i couldnt take my eyes off screen . sentiment still very much same i ability watch this film now over over it still hits me exact same way	1
i came into stuart gordon " king ants " expecting some weird blend science fiction horror . just look title . doesn't scream sci-fi/horror ? considering gordon other features almost always reside deep well blood soaked cinema , one could safely assume this picture would cover familiar ground . here guy who made films like " re-animator , " " castle freak , " remake " pit pendulum , " h.p. lovecraft adaptations " dagon " " beyond , " christopher lambert sci-fi vehicle " fortress . " i think it safe assume " king ants " should fall within these parameters , right ? boy , i wrong ! title " king ants " couldn't more misleading describing themes this movie actually covers . there no king , far i tell . there no ants , although they would quite difficult see unless they mutant ants stood fifty feet tall . instead , gordon gives us film adapted book charlie higson , film deals bad deal gone wrong subsequent bloody revenge wreaked upon principals unassuming housepainter who literally wrong place wrong time . well , least gordon penchant blood soaked cinema remains firm this project . sean crawley ( chris mckenna ) your average young guy just trying get housepainter when opportunity comes knocking one day form portly duke ( george wendt ) . two men strike up friendly rapport while working house , duke promptly invites his new friend meet most important individual . this person powerful construction contractor named ray mathews ( daniel baldwin ) , beefy thug love golf hatred certain accountant down city hall called eric gatley ( ron livingstone ) . mathews offers our boy sean specific sum money if he'll simply follow gatley around town report back his movements . it seems ray involved several shady schemes , schemes meaning kickbacks projects , eric nosing around hope saving city some money sending mathews slammer . crawley , always lookout few extra bucks , sees no harm tailing suburbanite . he heads over gatley home start his mission , can't help but notice accountant incredibly gorgeous wife . sean spends some time doing job reports back mathews . then something ominous happens . ray sean heart heart while mathews liberally gulps firewater . contractor seems indicate something " bad " should happen eric gatley , if something " bad " happens , big payoff might cards whoever carries out dirty deed . least this how crawley interprets conversation . next day he follows gatley home murders guy particularly brutal , bloody manner . then he turns up seeking payment mathews , but ray expresses anger what happened . he claims authorities all over him because they think he gatley bumped off . not only he refuse hand over cash , he tells crawley get lost . sean not sort chap take no answer , his persistent efforts get what owed him results kidnapping series extraordinarily brutal tortures inflicted upon him mathews , duke , few other stooges . much their everlasting detriment , ray company fail kill their former flunky . sean escapes , help most unlikeliest allies , returns full health goal seeking revenge his tormentors . end . i left bunch particulars out order not spoil film , but " king ants " really simple above summary . wronged man seeks revenge . that it nutshell . hands capable stuart gordon , however , movie manages entertain thanks number exploitative factors . first presence kari wuhrer , brunette movie actress who plays eric gatley wife susan here . through most unusual circumstances , she ends up offering help her husband murderer . her role also requires her some acrobatics her birthday suit this viewer greatly appreciated . second , gordon doesn't shy away violence . we've got golf club repeatedly hitting head , pools blood , refrigerator used murder weapon , gory showdown results all sorts ghastly indecencies . " king ants " contains more than enough bloodshed satiate avid gorehound . third , finally , gordon isn't above throwing few scenes weirdness just keep audience off balance . check out hallucination crawley experiences during his kidnapping . what heck thing all ? who knows , but it entertaining appropriately kooky . " king ants " sort category all itself . it doesn't really fit into field horror , it not entirely home standard revenge flick genre , either . if you like horror you like revenge shoot ' em ups , however , you'll probably enjoy gordon movie . i know i ; i would definitely watch this one again . dvd version film , extras abound . we get trailer , commentary track gordon , wendt , mckenna , lengthy behind scenes feature containing interviews many principal players . this short documentary interesting number ways , such learning it george wendt who played big role bringing this movie fruition . give " king ants " go if you get chance . it worth watching .	-1
" night heaven " opened 1983 terrible reviews even worse box office . it mainstay ten worst lists everywhere . it dubbed " flashdunce " after hit movie year . really , its not bad . insubstantial , yes . ill-conceived , yes . entertaining ? quite . lesley anne warren plays faye , speech professor local community college who marital problems . her husband whitney ( robert logan ) , emotionally stunted inventor , seemingly lost interest her she becoming depressed when her sister patsy ( deborah rush ) takes her out friends local strip club . there , faye surprised club star stripper , ricky rocket ( christopher atkins ) , same cocky student she just flunked her class . when he sees her audience , ricky virtual lapdance her , it isn't long before they plunged into affair . actually , there probably very good , serious film buried somewhere writer joan tewkesbury original script , which glossily directed oscar-winner john . avildsen , who went this fiasco " karate kid " . unfortunately , casting christopher atkins what obviously originally supporting role hurts film considerably . cast after his breakthrough role " blue lagoon " , atkins received star billing all film pre-release publicity . but warren logan lead characters , most screen time obviously main relationship film . this caused film quite obviously heavily reedited emphasize atkins character , who total jerk , completely amoral unlikable , poorly played one worst actors ever spit out hollywood system . this sinks film faster than " titanic " . result , what should serious examination marriage crossroads becomes smarmy sex-comedy/marital drama which disparate elements just don't fit . note brief 80 minute running time . this one film which i wish could reedited director cut , so we see what writer director original intent . instead , we forever saddled studio botched reedit . spite all this , " night heaven " remains entertaining easy watch . lesley ann warren gives good performance here , although i'm sure this film isn't listed her otherwise stellar resume . robert logan also quite good , although his presence bit eye-opener considering he best-known family films like " wilderness family " this film comes close soft-core porn any major hollywood studio film recent decades . deborah rush gives able support , there decent performance here actress named sandra beall ricky long-suffering girlfriend slick . late carrie snodgress also couple good scenes ricky mother . unfortunately , atkins ' horrible acting just negates performances everyone around him . it impossible excellent work when person you acting can't act save his life . it makes you appreciate warren work even more . she manages give good performance under circumstances commendable . one note : this film contains one sexiest love scenes i ever seen film , one only three reasons see it . other two ? warren performance bryan adams ' now-classic love them " heaven " , which plays its entirety over opening closing credits . when you take away seven minutes these sequences , leaves 73 minutes story , which makes cuts even more noticeable . " night heaven " one bomb early ' 80 should much better , but remains more entertaining than many much better films era . ** 1/2 ( out *****) ; ** execution ; *** entertainment value	-1

i admit when i 9 years old , this my favorite movie . when i watch it now , i still like it , but i see what wrong it . good things movie technical aspects . look this movie great . like ' batman ' ' sleepy hollow ' , tim burton brings distinctive look this film . set design great ape make-up terrific . problem characters . apes so much more interesting than humans . mark wahlberg character selfish jerk estella warren just stares blankly into camera . but apes great . michael clarke duncan good tim roth awesome general thade . danny elfman score good i liked ending , but movie can't compare original . it nowhere near interesting . whole ape society more interesting original it more serious ideas . ending this one makes you chuckle little , but ending original chilling . this movie works summer action movie , but not much more than , while original remains chilling classic .	-1

first , allow me clear up widely misunderstood notion . " minotaur " not receive its bad rap solely because it initially aired sci-fi channel . vast number elements , unrelated sci-fi network , contributed this particular disaster . monumental lack competent direction , nonexistent writing , laughable acting , " minotaur " would easily doomed itself failure any cable channel . what particularly troubled me most this film , however , its inexecusable waste two outstanding talents . rutger hauer tony todd . " hitcher " " candyman , " crying out loud ! how these two guys get suckered into throw-away roles they here ? they both deserve so much better ! , uh , not burst anyone bubble , but wasn't minotaur supposedly half man-half bull ? i admit my greek mythology tad bit rusty these days . but i seem remember reading up this specific legend my younger years grammar student . critter this here film seems little out place .

i confess big fan coen brothers , which why i surprised my response this film . cast die , it all makings terrific film . unfortunately , far it gets , cast cannot undo what screenplay seriously flawed , due its inability decide what type film it should . unfortunately , it looks if director could not make up his mind either , producing film neither fish nor fowl . first , i thought it would screwball type comedy , george clooney role would gone cary grant golden age filmmaking . then , it seems take direction altogether , if it supposed romantic comedy dark side or simply satire gone awry . who knows ? coen brothers surely don't . film lacks total surety identity kills it , despite stellar cast . it flop , pure simple . plot line fairly basic one . it slick , greedy grasping , unscrupulous matrimonial attorney ( george clooney ) , kind gives all lawyers bad name , greedy grasping gold digging beauty ( catherine zeta-jones ) , who gives all beautiful women bad name . their paths cross , chase . unfortunately , viewer not give rat behind either one them . there nothing would ingratiate them viewer , due two dimensional , leaden screenplay nowhere which laughs few far . if you die hard coen brothers fan , i am , yourself favor , rather than buy this film , rent it first . you thank me this advice , once you seen this film	-1

i'm so glad oscars turned out way they this year because no one more worthy receiving statue than martin scorsese . if you ask me , he should get one his every endeavor there never more consistent director genius history movies -- my biased opinion . his artistic integrity absolute body his oeuvre magnificent . i'm not sure how anyone else could made his landmark successes -- goodfellas , casino , taxi driver gangs new york -- any better . even secondary works like mean streets departed close perfect . this documentary , they go right primary sources , actors who worked him , means describing him . views jodie foster , paul newman , robert de niro , willem dafoe , joe pesci all recorded . i also liked scorsese insight music his movies separate character itself . i never considered before .	1

mel gibson took quite risk when he directed starred this affecting , poignant look male bonding . he surrendered his movie-star looks plays deformed man , whose biggest " action " scene holding back his barking dog . nonetheless , man without face triumph gibson ; it moving , thoughtful examination prejudice , love growing up . he matched his performance stunning debut nick stahl ( who not equaled this performance subsequently ) . stahl perfect young boy whose need true father figure propels him seek gibson guidance preparing his acceptance into boarding school . usually daft margaret whitton offers understated effective performance his oft-married mother gaby hoffman good his young stepsister . although much smaller scope than many gibson subsequent films , i found man without face much more enjoyable than bombastic braveheart , it underappreciated achievement gibson career .	1

i thoroughly entertained this 4-dvd set , basically because dyn-o-mutt character i always laughed my you know what off . his malfunctions coupled blue falcon seriousness my opinion what make series hilarious . lots credit goes vocal delivery gary owens who spite ridiculous situations his character put through thanks " dog wonder " , watching blue falcon slow burn malfunctions dynomutt then hearing him call his side-kick " dog blunder " , etc etc . well , me it funny but my sense humor off wall anyway . frank welker voices dynomutt . scooby side collection , i enjoyed programs ... pure nostalgia reasons if nothing else , scooby-dum makes appearance well . i give dvd set 4 stars because some same reasons discussed other reviews . this complete collection episodes aired under banner " scooby-doo/dynomutt hour " best my knowlege . however , mumbley , if i'm not mistaken , later added show title well later when several additional blue falcon-dynomutt scooby shorts produced { not full half-hour episodes , 7-8 minute shorts } . each dvd there contains menu selections course . however only one disc provides bonus material ... dvd #4 ... side 2 . i also search each dvd find masterpiece segment , which only runs little over 7 minutes , giving spotlight wonderful voice actors cartoon ... including what could one don messick last interviews early-mid ' 90s . clip don isn't dated it not certain when he ... he passed away 1997 so it safe say it before 1997 . frank welker shows us his vocal tricks ... he portrayed both fred dynomutt series ... oh , casey kasem also featured . anyone ears tell casey voice shaggy plus few cops criminals { including swamp rat one episodes } . casey , don , frank there nicole jaffe { velma } heather north { daphne } gary owens { blue falcon } . gary also narrates segment bonus selections side 2 dvd #4 recalling history scooby , which includes appearances fred silverman one half ruby-spears team created program . whole , nostalgia , i give dvd set 4 stars . like others said , it would've nice official opening credits theme songs here .	-1

they spend first half this movie saying how great ultimate warrior . journey awesome ! then all sudden , paid wwe guys just began bad-mouth warrior . maybe he questionable judgment - but why they trying make us feel bad someone we loved ? they take some very low blows . they say warrior bad wrestler . actually he seemed just fine me when i young , i really can't distinguish one ability other . they just all gang up him make outragious allegations . vince says quickly reason why ultimate disappeared 3 years because he failed drug test . soon he says this , they fade black then come back new issue . what drug use ? which drugs ? presumably they're talking steroids . but what high mighty hulk hogan his admitted drug use . let not talk - let just keep ganging up warrior . they completely ridicule him changing his name warrior . they also just try badmouth him so much . who cares none wrestlers liked him ? i don't! he excited heck out me way more than any dorks who say bad things him -including hulk . oh yeah - they don't even let warrior defend himself . why i find out imdb.com he asked appear but declined ? why don't they address this ? this " docu " more slanted than " fahrenheitt 911 " every wrestling ultimate warrior fan start out loving this docu then hating it . it just leaves you bitter taste your mouth , tired all whining bitter trash talking .	-1
what huge disappointment this release . i suspecting it wouldn't all great when i saw studio originally produced this show , 20th century fox , same video company releasing it . well , first season looks horrible . source material all 16mm dupe prints , some parts which out focus , scratched dirty . all cases image soft , well , like 16mm . compared what fox releasing voyage bottom sea , produced same year ( 1964 ) same studio boone , this release nothing short disgrace . we should given pristine 35mm source material , we're not . i suspect fox wouldn't release original camera negs it vaults without substantial fee . anyway , season one daniel boone isn't worth buying . i haven't seen season two , when show started filming color , but i'm now afraid look	-1
i high hopes this series when i started watching it , though i guess nonstop obscenities should tip off under all visual masterwork spiritually stunning characterizations there lurked twisted message wasted ten hours my life discover . shandala truly wonderful character , pure good , characterization her very tender , so episode 21 or so storyline actually looked like it could end hopeful uplifting . oh , how wrong me think so , because all philosophical religious trappings , message " hope " marketers promise characters learn end villain demented plan save world really more effective than their spiritualities " truth " emotional physical torture destruction innocent , good woman only way save world ! spare me . if you think i am disgusted this message , just imagine what muslims think when they see what becomes all quoting koran muslim character final opinions . although story technically good , i'm only giving it one star message despair .	-1

print looks like you're watching it through muddy water ; this something unclear " public domain " status this other capra works ? doesn't he family could help out his dvds way chaplin family , or even , use opposite extreme , family edgar ulmer , who released superlative versions some pretty dicey movies ? point if people paying something they deserve get it served up nice , all various dvds meet john doe painful watch . we've heard years re-worked ending film , one exists ( or existed one time ) . bring it ! now pleasure nearly entirely watching gary cooper react barbara stanwyck pure life . it sort like ball fire but bit more subtle . moviemakers knew they agood thing teaming two , because cooper slow-moving , nearly snakelike screen presence got injection caffeine when placed next stanwyck vibrant beauty her gorgeous clear gaze complexion . she doesn't even speak , she emanates something very basic her bones her posture . okay , movie writes itself into corner , what else going happen except if gary cooper not going kill himself movie break trust it established viewers . this always doe problem , it cheat come out ahead itself , it didn't work 1943 it still isn't working now . it great up until hour fifteen minutes ; then you feel gears start whine complain " hollywood " tries solve basically philosophical dilemma	-1

while this certainly isn't best pearl jam concert ever it isn't worst either . first disc starts little slow .. but you can't argue getting hear song like " my tree " " faithfull " . highlights : love boat captain ... nice opener . one best riot act song sure . my tree , one , if not my favorite pj songs . not quite rocking 2000 tour performances but still great . gimme some truth . maybe not technically perfect perfomance but heartfelt passionate . good john lennon cover . even flow . always great . spin black circle ... band starts get more into show after this rocking performance . thumbing my way ... just great slow song . breath . my opinion best performance show ... just great . crown thorns . i really like this version song ... played well whether you think ed should sing it or not . baba o'reilly . classic " who " song . great performance . just try sit still during this one . i would reccomend this dvd anyone pearl jam fan already but if you're not then i would start some their studio albums first .	1
alfred hitchcock second film after brought america david o . selznick suspicion , which he made while loan rko pictures . his first hollywood flick , rebecca , he put joan fontaine very good use ultimately these two films made her into star . fontaine won best actress academy award her portrayal lina mclaidlaw , bookish innocent ( but wealthy ) young woman who gets swept off her feet caddish johnnie aysgarth ( cary grant ) . after their quick courtship marriage against her father wishes , lina begins see johnnie who he really -- penniless leech -- but she naively continues love him nonetheless . johnnie charm ostensible , yet his irresponsible ways increasingly becoming inexcusable . lina trust eventually gives way suspicion when she begins believe he might go any length pay off his mounting debts . hitchcock masterfully builds suspense this movie manages maintain it duration picture . movie only flaw its tacked-on seemingly contrived final scene which , we told , due either mr. grant popularity during these years or existence production code effect hollywood time . hitchcock wanted darker ending but , we see here , he lost battle . however , he not give completely some would us believe . ending remains ambiguous enough allow us project either happy or sinister conclusion according our own sensibilities . suspicion classic hitchcock . grant fontaine turn masterful performances nigel bruce irresistible dimwitted loveable " beaky , " johnnie old chum . flawed ending prevents placing suspicion top any list hitchcock achievements , but it fine film nevertheless i only give it my highest recommendation . jeremy . forstad	1

i'm not going proceed judge this movie unhistoricity claims it makes christianity . now , thanks this film book same title , most individuals interested christology should aware this story nothing more than ignis fatuus . said , i make this critique based quality presentability film , not controversies it stirred within certain caucuses . movie code leaves much desired . there gaps story line overlooked pieces evidence louvre museum police no respectable law enforcement agency would fail detect . example , langdon detective neveu , after successfully evading captain feche museum , strike series clues ( writings , bloodstains , keys ) entire investigatory team analyzing crime scene failed uncover . langdon detective neveu fail ask each other seemingly obvious questions that- if answered- might end movie immediately or take it whole new direction . ian mckellen , fabulous actor extraordinary talent , lacks complete credibility this film . so what went catastrophically wrong ? well , it wasn't book or its author dan brown , who selling copies code faster then they count them . although performances best questionable , themselves these not enough sink movie . most obvious answer why code so deficient ron howard , director . mr. howard simply lacked vision forethought successfully credibly present da vinci code manner believable ( film , not history ) audience . i think most individuals who gave this film favorable ratings captured mystery romantic luster most conspiracies imbued , pre-formulated supposition jesus his relationship mary magdalene	-1
what challenge ! take two characters like aliens predators invent new story could make them meet more than challenge . it unimaginable . each one better than what they before yet both together even more dramatic formidable than each one may ever . then you keep human beings real center film , those who really going transfer their fear onto us , audience . situation believable allow no single minute respite or lack tension . film-makers behind this adventure revisited their good old mythology books ransacked backshop store known � old curiosity shop � . so we revisit pyramid civilizations ( three : aztec , egyptian cambodian ) great myth all times : antarctica which all these pryramid civilizations supposed come . then they revisited all stories ranting raving some space visitors who would taught animals homo erectus species how become homo sapiens . general idea space-visitors predators , aliens prisoners pyramid two thousand feet under ice antarctica every one hundred years some young predators sent earth hunt these aliens pyramid . course some human beings accept sacrificial victims whom aliens going born , hunt . easy since these human beings old not yet homo sapiens but only homo erectus . that what we told happened october 10 , 1904 going happen again october 10 , 2004 . unluckily some crazy human beings get way hunt . way lucky since these human beings set whole machinery pyramid work they become sacrificial victims who carry aliens life . course things not going go exactly way it planned predators . result absolutely perfect . human beings going reluctant resisting victims one manage go beyond simple hostility disgust help predators , hence saving world human race . details discovered film itself which spectacular . it reveals vanity human beings who get into adventure without even knowing what it all without any proper preparation . all those vain people who believe money , guns , science or whatever get end their vanity only survivor one who best prepared also least vain , so little vain her enemy my enemy my friend . this dangerous principle led many people into unbearably absurd situations incalculably lethal uncontrollable consequences . but times it safe believe it it safe practice it . though when first round finished my enemy who enemy my enemy my friend alliance defeat this common enemy goes back his basic definition becomes my enemy again war goes one more round . film-makers decided not go direction but genetically cross alien predator sequel some day few years tried tested first comic book , i guess . dvd numerous very interesting extra resources which quite welcome . dr jacques coulardeau , university paris dauphine university paris 1 pantheon sorbonn	-1

this movie combines two things i love film : actors able enjoy showcase their talents . this animprov lover dream . andit makes fun topic which takes itself too seriously , thiscase , dog shows . only one character film keeps importance dog rating context . mainly though , it just hilarious . some ( okay-a lot ) humor too crude my kids see unfortunately , nearly too crude me . still , it fits genre .	1

oscar nominee john travolta ( best actor , pulp fiction ) lovely scarlett johansson ( match point ) star this slow paced adaptation novel " off magazine street " ronald everett capps . movie features underappreciated performance travolta , who captures character bobby long perfectly . it mature performance travolta miles away any character he played before . movie pursy ( johansson ) , young 18-year old who lives florida boyfriend . when pursy hears her estranged mother lorraine died , she travels new orleans go funeral . problem , funeral few days earlier ; so pursy travels house lorraine left her find two men . one bobby long ( travolta ) , former english professor who now old drunk . other bobby protege lawson ( gabriel macht ) , who writing novel bobby doesn't seem going anywhere . pursy finds out lorraine left house two all three them , but instead leaving she decides live both men despite their misgivings . movie movies like memoir , there no particularly big events occur . it moves slowly , like life . there few turns events occur , but none them big enought warrant calling it " twist " . besides travolta wonderful performance , johansson perfect pursy . i would say this her best performance it would if not movie " match point " . not everyone like this movie , many find it dull stupid ; but this mature , sweet , fairly entertaining movie . seeing johansson half-naked wasn't bad either . i don't know how helpful this review convincing person see this movie , but i bought it 5 dollars wal-mart so it won't tragic loss if you don't like it much . grade : a-	1

only real crime surrounding this film murder chandler story . this just example someone capitalizing someone else reputation sell film . gould much marlowe pee wee herman mike hammer - i.e. , there no resemblence . additionally , cinematography terrible - it looks like cheap 70 movie shot video instead film . there absolutely no suspense , nor snappy delivery lines gould . i only imagine anyone who liked this movie probably cared more marlowe bare-topped neighbors than anything else , because there almost nothing redeeming value this movie . those fans real noir and/or hard-boiled detective pulp , don't waste your money or time watching this junk . you'll disappointed .	-1
this movie very much like american beauty , except it little better . this kind dark comedy made white men who lost their souls modern american life . but all other people , including myself , fight club not good . i get movie . i am consumer , like most americans . but not degree where i relate jack who main character . starting fight club re-discover masculinity or one identity absurd idea . what sad fact so many white men facinated whole idea fight club . no wonder only people joins fight club movie white males . no wonder only real people my life i saw raving this movie so far all " white men " . movie speak one truth . modern american life reached point sickness movie like this drawn significant number fans . like i said , i not come point yet i plenty things make my life significant meaningful . people should build family , serve their community , make real friends live happy significant life . fight club not necessary unless you really became like jack . not watch this movie unless you white male . watch if you really curious , but it waste time	-1

i always find it fascinating when i see people praising classic films yet when i watch them , i don't know what point . one those films ended up terry gilliam brazil . while visually cool , story-wise it kind boring i didn't really care characters which course big no-no . same fear loathing las vegas which i watched sober , so maybe big difference . nearly every weed smoking/beer drinking friend i town praises film . so we come 12 monkeys which i liked it so far one my favorites he . it year 2035 5 billion people died thanks virus unleashed army 12 monkeys , group people who infected world 1996 1997 . cole , inmate " volunteers " travel 1996 obtain pure sample since it long since mutated hopes engineering cure . however they sent him 1990 even worse , his rant ravings future viruses mankind near extinction gets him thrown nuthouse . what erupts there quite enthralling sure keep your brain their toes ... so speak . one thing i always love these kind films how certain things future get explained such literal writings wall phone messages it gets involving mentally , maybe bit too much so . while i didn't get confused , some scenes probably just fly over people heads leave them disoriented . especially its ending which i won't spoil while i figure it out what it , other parts i'm like " hey wait minute , what ...? " bruce willis , well maybe mark wahlberg orlando bloom , what i call " william hurt " factor : no matter how good their performance(or bad case bloom occasional wahlberg ) , they always sound so bored . however , this film arguably one bruce best . surprisingly it also one brad pitt , playing jeffrey goines , man who , box puts it mildly , few cards short full deck . then there madeleine stowe who i always liked films she but i rarely see her . while there other actors film , such david morse christopher plummer , it primarily these 3 get center attention . while i wouldn't necessarily buy 12 monkeys unless someone bought it me , it certainly quite enjoyable film its own right	1
" con express " lots action it , which great because this hides poor writing uninteresting characters . unfortunately , action isn't enough , stunt pieces shoot-outs , audience tempted doze off . city heat productions isn't really known producing films highest quality , so usually i go easy them . if this big-budget company producing this , i'd inclined pan it entirely . but i wasn't expecting much got little more than i bargained . action , most part , pretty good but nothing competitive your usual dumb action movie . flanery vosloo perfectly casted , but everyone else seems stiff add any more flow movie . vosloo especially appears enjoying himself over-the-top bad guy hijacking train containing deadly chemicals . film moves fast contains shades better movies like under siege 2 , con air , spy game , speed . if you liked those , you probably won't mind this one too much . just go easy it	-1

before i review , i'd like clear something up : i am very latecomer seeing this movie . i introduced ghost shell franchise through new anime series airing adult swim , ghost shell : standalone complex . i absolutely love show , so i figured eventually i'd get around seeing movie , which i knew full well shares no connection show . they're both seperate interperetations comic series same name , ( which i not read , so i don't know which more accurate ) but tv series exponentially better than this movie almost every concievable way . there many things i don't like this movie , biggest poor pacing . plot movie actually surprisingly straightforward once you cut away all filler , but that biggest problem . there not really enough story last full-length feature , because it seems almost like it originally written intention 30 minute short . since they didn't budget load movie up action scenes ( there barely any , they aren't very impressive most part ) they slow story down drawn out conversations you won't understand more than 60% , camera shots last what feels like minutes where we're looking either nothing , or woman nipples . that not cinematic artistry , that either lazy or perverted . animation itself isn't even good , especially considering this theatrical release only 10 years ago . it choppy , there not really whole lot detail ( except when it comes women nipples ) . looking just animation , if i didn't know better , i'd thought this movie ova 1980 . only thing i really say i liked this movie it ghost shell . it probably kind like how i didn't see 1989 batman movie until years after i'd spoiled batman animated series , couldn't bring myself like it any reason other than it batman . everything tv series superior this movie : animation , stories , character developement , production values ... i could go entire page how much better tv series . short , if you're you're all interested gits franchise , yourself favor rent dvds tv show instead . you'll find lot love , but i can't say same movie . my dream someday alex proyas give us gits movie lives up what i would hope after watching standalone complex	-1

i really liked this dvd . hard it watch all painful memories it brings flooding back into forefront consciousness . callous cold hearted indifferent nastiness reagan administration those it considered lesser americans lay hospitals suffering dying . this dvd shows dr gallo shallow man vaccuous heart lacking anything remotely akin human compassion unless course camera rolling . film shows cdc headed political hacks who elevated collected arts administrative spin control , reckless indifference suffering \ death people it not like stonewalling stuff mythic legend . while dvd shows ugliest demons human heart laid bare whole world might see it also shares most humane tender moments early days before hiv / aids got those names . film showed how even one america darkest hours when true presidental leadership asleep switch , little people those deep inside government all they could protect public health living up highest standards onr called offer themselves service our nation . dvd simply told truth it left pretty much viewer make up his or her own mind what they think those times . there some moving facts end dvd all now quite dated . i guess thing caught me so totally off guard running tally showing numbers sick dying people earliest days epidemic . it so sad how reagan adminstration so viciously sat its hands doing nothing while so many died epidemic it might not stopped but it might slowed significantly it only acted same fortitude home it mustered beruit or libia . yes i dwell too much sickening aspects those times because just seeing it again after lived through it makes me mad . seeing this dvd just convinces me we real leader white house when aids hiv grid gay cancer first burst onto scene things might not so grim . but this dvd so much more than venom pain loss it also highlights human kind its best . there much love this dvd balanced grim realities day . back day i not say i front lines , because indeed i not . i think this movie must anyone collection its current price it not beat . course i brought copy might buy spare lend out teaching purposes . this dvd pretty accurate hiv history it should told	1

what filth . what utter tripe . if early 90 didn't enough " white people bad , everyone else good " movies , comes this sick , unimaginative , racist garbage . i see ratings many viewers like this movie ( some whom appear unable spell most primitive words english language offer ) . let me ask you wannabe vatos locos this .... if this movie white people instead latino people , would you thought this movie racist ? think it ... white people starting gangs street prison based principle outkilling outbreeding other races people ? oh , but when non-white people it , suddenly it not racist . more bs hollywood double-standard bigoted drivel . way , how your vatos locos movement doing ? hmm ? it producing successful members society , or just more fodder prison gang rape ? exactly . you racist , degenerate losers back then , you're racist , degenerate losers now . though i doubt you'll ever learn . vatos locos forever ! ha ha ha ha ha what absolute joke . what insult humanity . grow up	-1
after his devastating demolishing m.a.s.h. , altman returns very smart picture . you should not forget how altman totally involved certain premises considered untouchables ; he made splendid film titled mccabe mrs. miller 1973 eventually he would round off his fabulous " three women " 1977 , considered his most bergmanian work . magisterial use country music just attractive facade explore carve relief lot basic profiles american people . there so much see analyze underneath . solid film became loved cult film since its immediate release .	1

critics lambasted kirk douglas ' performance " hammy " . i don't see all . this , without doubt , vincent van gogh we read " letters theo " miraculously brought life . van gogh actual life , whole thing kind creaking bipolarity it ; he periods creative bliss , happiness fulfillment , but they too short his almost unbearable intensity gets him into trouble too often too many people who help him . anthony quinn paul gaughan would seem like strange fit , but he pulls it off pretty well ; you feel arguments crashing them like thunderstorms , vincent unwavering belief their friendship so innocent enthusiastic one cannot help but feel heartbroken when it ends so terribly . douglas communicates vividly what we suspect van gogh reading his correspondences , his paintings ; he far too visionary ever really make it practical world , or overcome his restlessness long enough allow his art mature . beginning film more than any other sequence shows how violently alienated van gogh coteries social mores . his doomed-from-the-start mission minister ends ironically -- he too christian christians . while there explosion underground poverty-stricken children die very miner who introduced him their real hellish existence , he reprimanded his spiritual " superiors " dressing incorrectly . van gogh so enraged this he screams just what he thinks them , loses all chance path life . throughout film he remains christian , but he too much self-absorbed passionate artist always retain his ethics . douglas ' van gogh stick no situation or person very long : only constant thread his life his passion painting . sometimes performance so good we feel van gogh landmine madness coarsing through screen even empathize those who reject him because fiery nature could really scary times . we get chance see van gogh paintings way we never before , which probably best part this movie . his relationship his long suffering brother theo , played superbly james donald . he should gotten nomination best supporting actor , not anthony quinn , who turns roughly same performance every movie happened get lucky this one . somewhere inside him he knows his brother genius , but he still flesh blood van gogh deal financially otherwise . ending could not remotely powerful it without him . this film , despite concerning man titanic imagination , also good realistic attack myth tortured artist something romantic envied . barring his moments vision , van gogh life hell sorts led him miserable death . this nothing envy or emulate this movie communicates . still , beautifully must see anyone who wants understand one greatest painters ever live .	1

longtime fan batman comics , i definite ideas what batman movie should . i am pleased report batman begins pretty close my definition good batman movie - it certainly first incarnation live-action batman i would recommend friends . story - millionaire heir bruce wayne witnesses his parents deaths hands mugger . he ends up wandering world looking purpose comes across formidable enigmatic ra al ghul , head centuries-old organisation dedicated cleaning up corruption decadance ( they claim caused sack rome , example ) . he trains variety martial arts , returning gotham city ( fictional city " nyc nj " ) start his life crimefighting . his first target - mob kingpin carmine falcone . his second mission - save gotham ra's mad plan raze city example world . true batman fan , plot not so important execution . luckily designers batsuit understood batman not tank plods through badguys , but stealth fighter than surgically picks off baddies one-by-one , maximising fear remaining undetectable . same token , this batsuit flexible enough bale use martial arts moves not look awkward , unlike his film predecessors . similarly , new batmobile humvee-like military vehicle obviously take damage thrown it ( opposed suped-up corvette ) . also vital importance batman story incorporation his origin surrounding minor characters . just recent spider-man films incorporated large cast supporting characters pinned his personality his origin story , so too this batman film . this gives it richness depth vital its believability ( if such thing even possible superhero film ! ) . i especially pleased see big-screen debut lt . gordon corrupt bullying partner , det . flass . similarly , gordon himself , alfred , ra , scarecrow ( jonathan crane ) , etc . all used good effect here . unfortunately , there some nitpicking problems film . starters , where this character rachel ( played katie holmes ) come ? there perfectly good d.a. batman mythos ( harvey dent ) , why invent new one ? similarly , if female character needed endangered , why not vicki vale ? surely investigative reporter get into much trouble crime lord d.a. could . missing character ra's daughter talia . finally , ( spoiler alert !! ) batman fans very upset his greatest nemesis ( except possibly joker ) dies end film . fans comic know ra immortal - perhaps talia drag his body back lazarus pit revive him ? we actually see liam neeson again ? biggest complaint i , though , balance action detective work . me , batman sort cross bruce lee sherlock holmes . this film gone entirely bruce lee side left out sherlock holmes . granted , young impetuous batman would probably prefer busting heads careful csi-like forensic investigation . i only hope overseers warner bros . don't fall into trap making unending series action films , which would quickly get boring . detective work , if well , would welcome necessary aspect maintaining interest franchise . this special edition set most interesting due inclusion comic book . it contains few stories different eras batman comics , give reader overview evolution comic character . dvd extras themselves pretty standard only mildly interesting . they include featurettes new batmobile , development batsuit , etc	-1
labyrinth delightful movie fantasy fun all ages enjoy . this always one my favorite films , going back it adult only makes me enjoy appreciate it all more . jennifer connelly gives superb performance sarah , main character , whose baby brother taken goblin king ( david bowie one his best characters - who ironically gives often sensitive human performance while fanciful fantastic same time ; he wrote performed all music , which also some his best work ) . sarah must leave her world make-believe enter very real deceptive labyrinth save her brother time before he turned into goblin . way , we encounter large cast jim henson puppet-creatures , some which become sarah friends helpers her journey . puppets so believable you soon forget they not real people . movie filled magic , both off screen . film supplemented this dvd " making-of " documentary - original feature , narrated largely jim henson himself - made during actual production film ( released 1986 ) . such documentary makes one appreciate even more what goes into movie like this how complex creatures - what goes into their creation , how they operate , how they interact sets other characters ( especially this case live actors ) . it lot fun see this " inside " look , more than anything gives real sense who jim henson how much this all really meant him . my favorite quote jim henson this documentary when he said ( his inspiration motivation when he makes movie ) , " when i go see film , when i leave theater ... i like happier than i when when i went , i like leave up feeling , i like picture sense substance , life things matter me , " - wonderful sentiment remember this day age . lighthearted , fun , fantastical , funny , beautiful , exciting , more " real " than many today " realities " - extremely enjoyable uplifting . added bonus , monty python member terry jones wrote script ( interviewed documentary ) . cheryl mcfadden ( star trek : tng beverly crusher ) also all choreography film ( both humans puppets ) . : -	1

i am one many reviewers who purchased this dvd because everyone favorably compared it " seinfeld , " ( not hbo subscriber ) i never seen it . personally , i found this show boring , repetitive , often grating . well , that just me . you might among many people who enjoy this genre comedy . deciding if this dvd you require informed assessment you own taste . buy this dvd if you tend laugh protracted bickering among characters ( " married children " or vicki lawrence show " mama " ) . this not kind gut-splittingly funny politically charged bickering we once enjoyed " all family . " " seinfeld " , you see adults act childish , selfish , irresponsible , uncaring ways . depending how this , it very funny , but " curb " missed mark me . i find self-absorbed new yorkers ( those portrayed seinfeld ) funny , but self-absorbed californians ( " curb " ) just pathetic , not even laughable . you might feel differently . neurosis rudeness backhandedly ridiculed " seinfeld " , but almost celebrated " curb . " characters " seinfeld " roughly half generation younger than those " curb . " seinfeld characters ( who came age " me " era 1980s ) commit variety hilarious middle-age gaffes mis-steps associated lack direction life . older characters " curb , " other hand , offer us only repetitive uncreative barrage antagonistic behavior characteristic people who given up forging new directions life . they merely exist . you might find this funny , but i found it depressing	-1

sum things up , this really george lucus film-with then relatively inexperienced ron howard hired direct-under watchful eye lucus . lucus wrote screenplay , raiding his bookshelf tolkein ( especially " hobbit " ) lewis ( " narnia " ) . then he simply transferred hero/heroine romance his " star wars " screenplay . not necessarily bad thing , it simple way him build feature length screenplay targeting younger viewers but sophisticated enough entertain entire family . " willow " some scary stuff but should not problem average grade school viewer . my rating based comparisons other films similar target audience . i must confess up-front positive bias . my favorite part " star wars " caustic romance han solo princess leia ; " willow " lucus refined his technique actually improved something already close perfection . sorsha ( joanne whalley ) madmartigan ( val kilmer ) substitute nicely carrie fisher harrison ford , added dimension them begin story opposite sides . romantic elements efficiently subtly inserted into film . even though these characters part main storyline , romance separate enough serve film main parallel story . only downside this side story soon becomes more interesting than main one , so much so its climatic kiss ( occurring 20 minutes before ending ) unintentionally turns into film climax ( least energy wise ) . actual resolution main story then plays out rather anti-climatically . " willow " delivery quest story , much like " hobbit " where reluctant nelwyn ( small person ) required set out perilous journey return lost baby ( even smaller ) daikini ( tall person ) . way he assisted couple brownies ( yet smaller guys who speak outrageous french accents ) . size differentials main theme film especially intriguing young viewers who easily identify deal people who tower above them . howard encourages this identification process shooting most action child level . if you watch film young children you amazed its ability draw them into story , this happens because camera angles intentionally match child point-of-view world . viewing child surrogate title character ( warwick davis-who commentary dvd ) , unlikely hero who inspires audience sympathy he bravely faces dangers his journey while gamely putting up ever-changing group irritating companions . there frequent cutaways elora danan ( baby ) , mostly reaction shots . " raising arizona " , producers took enough stock clips match her expressions almost any situation . willow learns early cherlindrea ( dazzling fairy ) elora danan princess who ( it foretold ) one day vanquish evil queen baymorda ( fun role jean marsh ) . things get bit biblical/narnia here queen seeking eliminate princess before she becomes threa t.t he dvd features : " willow : making adventure " ( made during production 1988 ) " willow : morf morphing " ( made 2001 dvd release ) , really put film historical context relative its place evolution special effects . it really transitional point where photochemical ( film ) effects subordinated digital effects . this gave " willow " significant place film history these two featurettes taken together nicely illustrate continuing challenge those involved special effects ; any new development soon overused no longer audience draw . meaning effects people stay cutting edge simply justify their existence . then again , what i know ? i'm only child	1
french pedagogy differs american , so american viewers should not expect american classroom french accent when they watch " " ( " etre et avoir " ) . despite differences style language , however , film powerful because it taps into reservoir universal experience . adults sometimes idealize childhood . maybe they really perfect lives youth , but more likely their memories short . " " recaptures not just innocence sponteneity childhood we idealize , but also uncertainty , need accepted understood , need sometimes difficulty understanding , influence family , importance wise caring teacher or guide . children positively endearing , very individual . some stars ; others struggle . george lopez , instructor , soft-spoken reaches his students ' minds through their hearts well intellect . one things struck me early film how effectvely he reached through his students his quiet wisdom steady hand tiller . quality cinematography editing also excellent support film beautifully .

klaus von bulow ( played jeremy irons ) inject his wife sunny ( glenn close ) insulin cause her fall into coma or not ? originally convicted , this appeal case reversed decision . close narrates film her coma state , ron silver plays hot-shot lawyer alan dershowitz non-stop energy . movie very spirited captivating although it revolves around legal case , it not really courtroom drama since very little it accurs court ; instead we see silver aides scurrying around like chipmunks gathering their appeal case data . course , weight movie lies irons , rather cold , mysterious man who may or may not telling truth . legally he gets off , but we're left impression morally he may guilty . movie compelling we're watching , but , strangely , i found images scenes movie quickly evaporating after it over : it no lasting power . irons won oscar his role	-1

harvey keitel stars fbi agent this dark death-filled tale gangs london . premise simple one , one we've seen many other mob movies . older , established mobsters code honor try things proper way . rash , up coming punks care nothing honor just want quick cash drugs . this case , it american - carl frazer ( played viggo mortensen ) who causing trouble . fbi sent john harris ( keitel ) help london police force shut him down . carl truly psychotic drug / arms dealer who loves gather up lost but innocent young men , tell them they special , then turn them into cold blooded killers . carl gets his thrills corrupting virtuous . there many comments throughout movie - both cops old time mobsters - how these young , sweet kids their lives destroyed drugs lure cash . one scene , old mob guy attacked two these ' kids ' who trying kill him . when he turns tables them , he refuses shoot them - he just tells them leave him alone . i admit i bit issue this constant referring adult men " kids " - they appear their early 20s , they out drinking , working , lives . it always tragic when someone led astray , but call them helpless " boys " or " kids " marginalizing their maturity , my mind . maybe if they'd made boys movie 13-15 age range it would played better me . any case , movie little cardboardy . you crooked cops . keitel hard-fbi-guy-who-is-still-tender . mob guy rough but tender too . viggo over top psycho who smashes prostitute face party because she snorting coke instead doing her job . his main lines action only let him show ' moralless insanity ' without many shades anything else . keitel got lot good moments depth his role , tough bad guys , really caring innocent , wrapped up knots his home life . great role provided craig kelly - he great young man ( oops i mean helpless boy ) who first tries avoid getting sucked into situation , but finally make some hard decisions . violence end , there lot it . there also lot loud clubbing , meaning either your ears blown out noise or you're missing soft dialogue because it muddled . i usually don't any issues all sound balance dvd so i really find it odd how mix here . maybe part intention - make you feel like you didn't know what going immersed this throbbing london scene . great movie watch once - either rental or tv - before you decide if you want actually own it	-1

i never bought vhs tape , but when i notified this would coming out dvd , i ordered it . while i'm not amateur , i am professional , eric guitarist guitarist . anyone who thinks he don't need learnin ' fool only famous his own little world , small it may . i'm not arrogant . danny gatton known humbler , eric johnson could rightly called inspiration . what he not so much difficult it epitome finesse transparency technique . after viewing this , you understand what i mean . i already know much what eric teaches this session , what it , private session ( much like you might get git ) , master top his craft . but there always something learn even after repeated viewings . i even scanned booklet comes this so i break lessons down blow up individual charts more easy reading . if you serious improving player , if you're looking real professional , you need get this , if only see what true professionalism looks sounds like . lessons clear focused . booklet new ability slow down examples , you really learn play these things . but don't expect sound like eric ( just those who tried , but could never sound like jimi hendrix ) . you different so always sound different , that plus . but techniques all included here part " must learn " program you need create follow if you want least make good living playing music . learn master melody technique , where technique doesn't get way melody , but lives service song -- way it should . i teach , too . i recommend any student who wants grow they should get this dvd . if you get no other , this would serve whatever style you choose pursue , ultimately , because there so much here applied virtually any style , whether it jazz , country , blues , rock or even acoustic ( which i wish he would included segment , my only kvetch )	1

me , roger waters ' explanations themes behind album highlight here . he seems think deeply life , but also able express his thoughts simply eloquently . i'd imagine he would made top-class psychologist if he hadn't taken rock roll path . he definitely aura leader , defining piece it direction , while other band members seem content talk musical aspects album , well circumstance its making . this valuable too , its own way , rick wright seems especially good describing his influences music-writing process . there also good input alan parsons chris thomas , well occasional long-haired jounalist giving their commentary album impact . there some on-stage footage , but don't expect too much ; this , after all , documentary making album , it stays well focused task . bonus material exceptional ; highlights include roger waters demo tape " time " radically different finished album track , david gilmour giving some virtuoso solo performances . its hard imagine how it could much better	1
i love this movie , it cute movie , easy watch , makes you smile alot . i think its girl movie	1
reality bites seemed fresh when it first released , giving voice generation - unfortunately derogative soubriquet " " - overeducated , underemployed , plagued flashy , trashy commercialism mtv , stunningly superficial its wholehearted embrace pop culture rejection serious moral or philosophical discourse it might stumbled across college . it good start because transitioning idyllic unreal world college crass , cruel arena materialism tough , providing limitless opportunities challenge personal growth - very stuff real movies . instead we swan dive into pizza hut commercial held together plot so shop-worn it would considered exhausted 1930 . winona ryder winning lelaina , but one only imagine sats football players college where she valedictorian . her " documentary " appallingly narcissistic , reflecting characteristic gen notion - " if it me , it art , it important . " ethan hawke excellent job troy , very archetype self-satisfied , supercilious entitlement . we expected root him , but it hard refrain hoping he gets hit bus . stiller , who directed - talented fellow almost impossible look - plays michael , " anti-troy .

" paradise now " one first post-september 11 films terrorism i've seen it one most overlooked powerful . saying it overlooked isn't completely accurate , it nominated best foreign film academy award it won best foreign film golden globe . most people won't see it though , because it arabic english subtitles . movie two palestinian men named said ( pronunced si-eed ) khaled , who see their life like prison they can't get out . both these men long paradise , whether it real or just their head . so two men join group martyrs , bombs strapped their bodies , begin crossing into israel commit suicide mission tel aviv . it not so one-sided though , movie kind sidetracks ... soon said khaled cross into israel , they separated . khaled gets back martyrs , while said begins wandering around realizes mission his fate he can't change it . movie pretty insightful looking motivations terrorism ( like critic john anderson says cover , although i'm paraphrasing ) ... but , same time , i think most terrorists don't think way said khaled . movie isn't likely offend anyone offended films like " world trade center " or " united 93 " because it terrorism , but not same kind portrayed those films ( i haven't offended any film i've ever seen , so this just opinion ) . even if you're not into reading subtitles , this haunting important film should seen people . this movie potential shown classrooms some point . world where politics make you win oscars grammys ( michael moore , rage against machine , etc . ) ... " paradise now " small foreign film should just seen . grade :	1

i go ahead try break down each disc really memorable moments . every episode certainly something you remember , say great score show , or exta great voice acting batman or guest star , or maybe it one storyline you remember where you seriously thought it thriller , but i try point out some little things this show . course i like 9-10 years old when this show started , but it odd how show gotten better after not watched it around 12 years . disc one- this one my favorite batman episode , movie , whatever , perchance dream how bruce wayne wakes up his parents alive , he married selina kyle , he not even batman , it perfect life . or it ? batman his most thrilling moment this episode . robin reckoning really good serious episode . good conflicts good guys . this easily best disc this volume it also one joker most psycotic episodes-the laughing fish , ninja episodes also get started this disc . disc 2- cat scratch fever one my favorite lines series , batman commenting catwoman fever feeling her head says " you're hot " , catwoman- " now you notice " . hell yeah catwoman hot . heart steel freaking great episode which takes lot bladerunner , which definite good thing . if you're so smart , why aren't you rich episode which i always personally watch one my top 10 batman episodes . it great part where guy so afraid go sleep he goes bed holding shotgun under his blankets . joker " wild one very rare non-great joker shows . i didn't like tyger , tyger all much , one 2-3 episodes i didn't really care , but hey , still better than any cartoon today . disc 3-i said earlier disc 1 best one this maybe but this one tied . moon wolf- tjis great robin college episode scarecrow back up his evil scarings . day samurai- ninja series continues . terror sky- super , great , extrafragalisticexpialidocious episode , serious , yet kid campy funny too . almost got ' em- this episode great example why i love this show . it really takes you back 50 one best humor shows also crams like 5 stories single episode still manages beginning spectacular ending . birds feather-great showcase penguin . what reality- good riddler episode great end level type bad guy . i am night- very emotional episde revolving around commissioner gordon . disc 4- great one all 7 good 6 classics . paging crime doctor ver touhcing episode . harley ivy wonderful episode might chick episode but still us guys too . zatanna always one my favorite characters she knows who batman , i see her coming back future episodes . i left very memorable line top off all these outstanding episodes . man who killed batman , bullock says no make-up , blond hair harley- " don't i know you somewhere " , harley- " i believe i served you sepina once , it small sepina " . absolutely classic . so overall this better than volume 1(no disrespect ) , if continued this fashion , could gone down greatest show ever , but everything come end sometime , right . also i got this mart(nebraska furniture mart ) 26.99 brand new .	1

honestly other reviews it right when they say you should buy yourself hd dvd player buy this movie . it looks amazing , sound out this world film very good , boot	1
tootsie complicated film say least . actor perhaps too much pride his art his own good subsequently alienates any director he ever could've hoped work . he needs finance his friend play , but he can't find work . obvious solution : disguise himself actress get part daytime drama . wrong hands , this could've played out like daytime drama , but smart dialog , careful direction , brilliant performances give film clever grace raise it above trappings its plot . watching dustin hoffman obliviously speak out against his own discretions force us somewhat reevaluate our own views gender . i can't think actor who could've pulled off character , even those who given great drag performances ( i'm not referring wayans brothers , case you wondering ) . bill murray also achieved brilliance roommate who his best take everything stride but thinks maybe " we're going into weird area here . " eighties-ness might little much times ( i little dumbfounded hearing my mother sing one musical interludes next room ) , but this film entertaining it contrived . it doesn't logically work ( i'm little curious how they wrote hoffman character off show after his secret revealed ) , but film this inspired , who cares ?	-1
such incredible energy !! musical genius makes it look so easy . he truly loves play sing rock ' roll it shows . his band also best . insrumentals very complicated but fogerty his group up task . not one dull moment this entire dvd . i highly recommend it .	1
i'll admit i thing sean patrick flannery , but he only one reason i love this movie . this like paperback romance bundled up into lowbudget tv movie . loved it	-1
i just got into asian films , especially japan . daibosatsu ( its title japanese ) amazing piece film , which won adjective " classic " . original thing sword doom , ryunosuke ( principal character ) , kind psycho . he almost never expresses any emotions always talking cold , slow , heartless , monotone , emotionless tone ( only twice he laughs eerie thing listen ) , simple , if-you-said-the-wrong-thing-i'm-going-to-slay-you kind way . guy doesn't even blink . he doesn't care if someone wants kill him . he kills old man just because . story around end tokugawa shogunate , when old order falling apart birth meijin restoration hand . although not necessary , little bit knowledge period help appreciate this movie . b/c , but it helps movie . one things i like best it shows what real swordfight using katanas would look like , not fancy metal clashing against metal hollywood , europe some asian(including japan ) movies . movie strange sense you don't develop any emotion ryunosuke , even when you know he lacks few marbles . simple , he just , you accept tha t.t he story simple , man expel fencing school , challenge match ( pay attention , match , no duel ) , winner become heir school when sensei dies . can't tell you much , ( match turn into duel ... ) simply he so neutral , so amoral , makes him dangerous . his own father wants him dead . he joins shinsengumi , but his lack emotion , together his disregard bushido ( well , not always , but enough piss off hardcore samurai , even those times left interpretation ) , gains him hatred his assassin buddies . ( i highly recommend you read shinsengumi ) . movie great , simply , yet deep . story man obsessed improving his swordmanship , no matter who or what he ends destroying . buy it , i usually tell people rent movies first but i doubt you get this any rental . but don't worry , if you like samurai movies , you like this one . unless you hate enimagtic endings ... which me , it makes story even better .	-1
even though this dated material , corrs , their prime , unique entertaining band . talented fun-loving , they music " hooks you " . almost every song sing-a-long-able , ( new word i created ) . special features , also , help educate their fans or fans-to-be their style inspiration . but , music needs no introduction . it deep , pop , danceable . like abba . there not one song i skip over , after repeated plays . little over-edited , video keeps moving . picture leaves little desired . fans engaged band become part experience . fun watch their reactions	-1
unlike many reviewers here , i'm not biblical expert really don't care if movie adheres stories they portrayed bible . i would just judge movie based its entertainment value ability engage me emotionally . biggest problem this movie it simply seemed too long drawn out . there also some scenes felt like padding added nothing story ( some cases detracted it ) . instance , during long voyage while earth covered water , everyone goes bit crazy . that acceptable premise but it played out theatrically far too long variety embarrassing scenes actors . idea they suffered madness fine introduce but it shouldn't taken up so much time nor quite so adbsurdly plotted out like little play . there also couple ridiculous encounters water ( lot acting pirate merchant who sold them various trinkets water ) which undermined entire story great flood . everyone supposed perished flood it bit absurd few would sailing high seas little boats . it just plain silly , again , seemed put just pad story or add unnecessary " spice " ( it didn't work means jazzing up story ) . i'm guessing writers felt time water long show how noah his family suffered or their faith tested but they also felt it more interesting than just lounging boat taking care animals . this type insecurity telling story most effective way what causes so many productions go bad . movie credit , actors quite good there some good moments but too much movie doesn't work .	-1
i bought this movie my wife . she loved it	1
me , this film matt damon , brilliant newcomer who came out ( seemingly ) nowhere . i floored his performance - one best 20th century . course he supported fine cast - robin williams , ben affleck , loveable minnie driver , whose onscreen chemistry damon sizzling . matt emerald heap cheap diamonds , obviously multi-talented guy - he co-wrote screenplay well starred it . well worth seeing .	1
i don't expect anything more movie than enjoy it entertained . i don't seek psychoanalyze or offer up in-depth critique , it only movie . i either enjoy it or i don't . this one still cracks me up ... marty feldman hilarious , there some corny humor , sure , but it highly enjoyable	-1
it only one competitor so far " air america " .. but air america cannot stand repeat viewing ... i watch this movie every 4 months still bein stitches ...... this definately " mans " comedy ... women not find it funny most men !!! but my opinion it still remains funniest comedy first decade new millenium . ps why doesnt amazon spell checker different fonts/size fonts ??	1
definitely , season 4 columbo winner replete number excellent episodes provide hours enjoyment . " exercise fatality " robert conrad owner string health clubs who murders his partner , " dawn early light , " military school commandant ( patrick mcgoohan ) who murders trustee who wants convert military school co-ed community college , clearly best lot . what fascinating columbo not only quality writing pacing episodes , but remarkable cadre top tier actors appeared show : jack cassidy , robert vaughn , dean stockwell , george hamilton , john cassavettes , oscar werner , lesley ann warren , robert culp , leslie nielsen , janet leigh , gena rowlands name few . if you buy only one season columbo , make it season 4 . unfortunately , only extra dull completely unnecessary episode ms. columbo " caviar everything . " still , no interviews or extras clearly leave columbo fans disappointed hope future boxed sets something more enticing watch -- even episode ridiculous " a-team " would more welcome than ms. columbo . address problems many other amazon reviewers experiencing their dvd sets , i say my set works just fine no malfunctions . i might suggest keeping your dvds their plastic sleeves refraining using them coasters when not use might help . if doesn't work , invest better dvd player .	1
this delightful romantic comedy very engaging main actress ( marguerite moreau ) . after spending years " jerk magnet " , she quit dating scene when lo behold , two decent guys real potential come . like they say , " it never rains but it pours " . she then faced opposite problem deciding which guy would better choice . while watching it , i didn't really know how things would turn out because both guys she into actually quite likeable . fortunately everything ends happily . well it romantic comedy . :) i thought customers might want know specs this dvd seeing amazon continued its bad habit omitting tech specs newer releases . dvd screen media films . it it original aspect ratio 1.85.1 ( enhanced widescreen tv ) . colors accurate . there quite bit film grain but not too distracting . my only quibble presentation black levels closer dull grey so transfer lacks sense depth richness . soundwise it 2.0 5.1 surround pretty decent sound reproduction . there no close captions or subtitles contrary what it says backcover amazon . all all very enjoyable movie . definitely worth viewing	-1
i just really able appreciate this film . sure there some lines i didn't like i little unclear some plot aspects i wished we could seen what happens characters after film ended . but overall , i really loved message film originality it . this film love , sexuality , relationships . it really beautiful . most what i must praise highest acting . every single person casted perfectly what their unique talents offered . corazza very believable truthful actor . his acting lends himself innocence sympathy -- just what matt needed . taylor brilliant . she exudes power assurance . she played every one her very difficult lines absolutely perfectly . she perfection . allison surprising convincing excellent . i say surprising because man dressed woman clothing , this first movie where i actually liked character this character believable not stupid stereotype . shannon real person me . boyd absolutely excellent . she seems most experienced clear veteran art . they so lucky get her this . she world-class actress . this film just really enjoyable . i really found writer ( fraser ) commentary especially interesting . this film daring , original , well-directed . little unbelievable points , but enjoyable none less .	1

simply stunning flick hd dvd . considering early reviews downplayed difference standard dvd hd , i wasn't expecting such incredible image ( some hd dvds aren't much improvement over regular dvd ; see serenity ) . this disc i'll throw whenever i want show someone what hd dvd all . movie , this what sci-fi should : daring way over top . after pitch black , who would thought riddick story would taken such epic turn ? i don't know whether it ego trip , creative cliff diving , or just return " old school " sci-fi where writers created new myths , unique worlds , bizarre technology ( tread dangerously toward embarrassment coining their own vocabulary -- it get any better than " underverse " " necromongers " ? ) . i hope it latter , but it doesn't matter . just enjoy ride . all tired sci-fi thrown us hollywood , it great something fresh given us . forget what you've read critics fanboys out there ; chronicles riddick real goods . great hd dvd	1

but things really changed much since late forties ? this gem movie neglected classic americana . " letter three wives " uses many same talents who made " all eve " such hit year later , most notably joseph . mankiewicz writer/director celeste holm , who present here voice only addie ross , town flirt . just three town more prominent clubwomen depart day-long trip underprivileged children , they receive note addie -- she run off one their husbands . they whole day think which one it . jeanne crain character insecure because she left her iowa roots married up one town gentry . linda darnell character " shanty irish " married department store millionaire whom they share rather grudging relationship . ann sothern plays radio screenwriter who trying maneuver her way out second-best neighborhood town into very best . sharp observations class social climbing small towns/suburbia , this film sharp writing acting some genuinely funny moments , including star turn kirk douglas droll english teacher ( bet you thought you'd never see him comedy ! ) . look wonderful thelma ritter maid wrong side tracks . all all , " letter three wives " great entertainment welcome addition any video collection . i seen my copy several times introduced it several people .	1

mention name roger moore average moviegoer they'll most likely immediately associate him james bond franchise . makes sense me . after all , moore took up mantle thrown down sean connery eventually made some seven bond films , beginning " live let die " 1973 ending " view kill " 1985 . i'm partial roger moore because this very fact . he definitely my favorite bond ; i enjoy his glib wit , expressions fear when confronted daunting situations , just way he handles himself onscreen . i never turn down opportunity watch one his films when amc or channel runs yet lengthy 007 marathon . it natural , considering how much i enjoy his bond films , i would seek out other roger moore projects . thanks dvd , we're starting see his work " saint " several other efforts reemerge . i'm still waiting " wild geese " , up until short time ago , i eagerly awaited arrival " ffolkes . " finally , i procured copy immediately sat down watch . i wanted see if i liked movie much i ten or fifteen years ago . " ffolkes " story rufus excaliber ffolkes ( moore , course , lower case last name some reason ) , crusty old tar who runs mercenary security service his retirement . you could say this chap sort gentleman businesses turn when they need top-notch security . you could also say governments might turn him well when faced threats not easily deterred conventional forces . , my friends , exactly what happens when terrorist named lou kramer ( anthony hopkins ) hijacks two british oil rigs north sea . technical assistance nerdy looking harold schulman ( michael parks ) gang muscle , kramer rigs platforms high explosives then sends his demands london . predictably , prime minister ( faith brooks ) her cabinet outraged . tendency not negotiate terrorists , however , places government real bind . fortunately , certain insurance concerns -- quite agitated destruction rigs could bankrupt firm -- call rufus excaliber ffolkes save day . it sort task he his people relish , kramer carefully prepared plans demand intellectual well physical response . it tough assignment made all more difficult stormy , cold region . ffolkes rapidly coordinates his plan attack help admiral sir francis brindsen ( james mason ) . outfit manages remove one rigs danger quite quickly easily , but second one bit harder since kramer his thugs float right beside it small boat . kramer emotional state deteriorating fast weather outside . nordic crew ship , led captain olafsen ( jack watson ) , resents their kidnapping kramer constantly irritates terrorist . this cautious defiance , coupled grinding process negotiating british government , soon wears heavily kramer . he oscillates calm explosive rages , always inches away detonator blow rigs sky high . vast majority film takes place boat nearby rig , ffolkes disguises himself british naval officer hope he board ship part negotiating team bring evil kramer down . needless say , plan doesn't go quite smoothly hoped . ffolkes british government save their oil production facilities nick time ? watch see . moore great this movie . he plays no nonsense sort guy set like stone his ways . misanthrope penchant cats , needlepoint , love scotch , loathing women runs core his soul , ffolkes makes interesting character . played roger moore , he hilarious because we immediately realize this guy far james bond one could get . less compelling , least hardcore action film fans , pace content movie . picture one talkiest action movies you're likely see , even when action breaks out it not enough tide over fans big body counts massive explosions . there also several moments incredulity where viewer likely say , " no way . would never happen ! " but that o.k. i like moore so much , i always enjoy watching anthony hopkins go off deep end , i forgave director writer not giving us non-stop action flick . but if you're sort filmgoer who eschews character development tension favor cartwheeling bodies stuff blowing up , you'll likely chafe bit this movie . i'd like give dvd presentation film five stars . i'd like , but i can't couple reasons . one , nary extra graces disc . nothing . nada . zip . not even trailer film . ouch ! i don't know why " ffolkes " received such shabby treatment , but it undeserved my opinion . second , probably more germane actual film , i didn't enjoy movie quite much i when i saw it back when i younger lad . like i mentioned vague way above , i encountered several unbelievable situations scenes during my latest trip through movie . yet " ffolkes " still great , still lot fun , definitely worth seeking out not only bond fans but moore fans well .	-1

stnj , clandestine government organization , employees tasked hunting down capturing witches removing them society . ostensibly , this keep them becoming menaces they recognize begin use their powers . when one their own taken away witch , young italian raised nun , robin , sent replacement . she quickly proves adept hunter , takes initiative hunting , proving herself invaluable team . viewed action title , robin seems episodic , " monster week " feel it . but watching this series carefully , you realize , just storyline , not everything it seems . witch hunter robin excellent gothic mystery , full symbolism , twists , turns , clues . characters develop throughout , not one same when character introduced . robin grows changes through series , she learns many things stnj , her often shady co-workers , her own mysterious pas t.t his title deals witchcraft , subject offensive many . initial portrayal all witches evil should removed society . series deals its own demons demonstrating there many forms evil man visits his brother , addresses paradox fighting evil evil . characters themselves often struggle what good evil when witchcraft involved , giving show vividly realistic feel . those concerned violence or nudity , there violence , but it not gratuitous , it used only advance story demonstrating various witches ' powers . there no nudity . robin seen bath her shoulders up time time . this title definitely worth seeing , again again	1
completely honest , i fooled first episode this series . it so light-hearted innocent i couldn't possibly suspected what come . then , series got , i began understand dark undertones this series , i got feeling i watching something more than simple " alice wonderland " adventure . story follows young boy named shu , brash kid enough energy share ten people , he finds himself strange , desert world ( this starts after first episode ) after battling save blue-haired girl some mysterious , robot-piloting soldiers his home town . this world , away where he grew up went school , shu instant odds leading force here , must not only battle save lala-ru ( blue-haired girl ) but keep himself alive well . ultimately , he ends up prisoner mad king suffers terrible tortures until king satisfied shu knows nothing more than what he admitted . so , shu becomes one child soldiers king army . still , he simmers circumstances his enlistment , eventually makes his escape . outside influence king , shu meets group people who only ones capable putting up fight against mad king , expected , shu decides he should join them . naturally , terrible battle ensues which shu becomes involved . story now then , here there , continues get more more dramatic every episode begins ends , new characters introduced lives lost , it becomes easy get so deeply involved this sentimental violent story you actually feel emotions . it just well , through through . now then , here there compares green legend ran lot ways , but much better my estimation . it also lot similarities some early miyazaki films , such nausicca castle sky . note , though , my recommendations go older audience , not younger audience target miyazaki films . yes , this animation innocent look , but this story definitely isn't younger audience . thirteen may too young , but lot worst happens ( including rape torture ) implied so make it little better . fifteen or higher would better , though . either way , this great box set own , it very cheap ( thirty bucks entire series ) all original material found during now then first dvd release . plus , it powerful anime dramatic , plot-driven story .	1
there something heartbreaking listening people no sense humor explain , resolute logic , why something isn't funny . unless you're unapologetically homophobic , which case you don't deserve fun , there just no reason why you wouldn't delighted this minor masterpiece . forget movie , all you need premise start laughing . australia , widely known most macho place earth , three drag queens go epic journey inland ancient bus named priscilla which routinely breaks down most inconvenient times . while lip-synching abba tunes blaring boom box hardly strikes me art ; combination costumes , wigs , make-up , attitude , dancing required create drag show group aborigines impressive very least , if not heroic . it seems me mrs. doubtfire , tootsie matter , projected level awareness scrubbed so clean it would home love american style . priscilla , contrast , strikes perfect balance . it madly over top hilarious , reveling sheer absurdity outrageousness it all . but it also warm , never patronizing , more characters get know each other more you get know them like them process . there difficult choices end movie , loss . then you really care . all three leads terrific , but terrence stamp standout here . invisible craft he delivers bravest performance his career , it real nuance , not easy pull off when you look like cher . certainly kind film one would qualify " cult classic , " well worth owning . just thing take off shelf when you're starting take yourself too seriously . y-abba-d-abba-do	1

this film true story . it important you know because some facts reactions seem excessive , yet ... it all starts bunch rowdy black kids who run across older white man , local personality who starts playing these boys ten or eleven these boys decide fight against it , probably without knowing what they fighting against , except it not correct let older white man touch you if you little black boy . local police justice officials go road leads same boy who arrested � molesting � older man triple death sentence triple murder he never committed never investigated properly . film absolutely outstanding because it sets emphasis this black man , ex-world champion boxing , transcending this fate getting so high his meditation he truly free prison truly divine his mind . this hurricane thus set example model anyone whose freedom endangered , we move 15 year old black boy brooklyn who buys reads rubin carter book booksale 25 cents . his own life series accidental cicumstances lead him deprevation among alcoholics some achievement � host family � canada . this black boy , lesra , identifies rubin gets involved his case . his canadian guardians get this involvement they eventually bring truth out convince federal court man innocent released prison immediately . what important here how these people react organize their search how it succeeds thanks some nearly immaterial circumstances go their way not simple automatic habitual way . it such cases justify people thinking there hope our societies where poor cannot any justice all because they cannot afford good lawyers very start , later it too late : initial damage rarely redeemed , yet some cases there prove it could , even if it not most time . this one films should studied details all high schools all over world . dr jacques coulardeau , university paris dauphine university paris i pantheon-sorbonne	1

beautiful job dear people warner ! all films included nicely mastered fine prints , but " sweet bird youth " seems little pale shade too dark . no disaster , though ! my only real complaint two more tennessee williams films owned warner left out box . some people upset titles like " boom " " summer smoke " not included . how could they possibly ? they owned other companies . warner home video issue films made mgm warner bros ., but not those owned universal paramount . but ... warner rights " glass menagerie " " period adjustment " ! why these not included this box mystery ! so please , warner , not forget issue them soon possible ! some good universal paramount regarding " boom " " summer smoke " , tennessee willams list films would complete dvd ! well , i suppose we campaign " last mobile hot-shots " too	1

it very disappointing see major actors , cinematographers , editors doing good job decidedly sub-rate material . film looks much , much better than its story . one begins doubts when this family " geniuses " reveal little intellectual heft conversation interaction . paltrow character virtual cipher whose only talent seems finding stashes her cigarettes , despite her promotion " prodigy " . purported love triangle no apparent basis , other words , audience told accept premise without evidence . problem this film written people who not professional , creative writers . characters must shown " interesting " , " conflicted " , " in-love " , " suicidal " , etc . their words actions , not simply because we told they . this only accomplished subtle clever writing , which wholly absent here	-1
i would rate this piece film trash " 0 " , but unfortunately , not available option . this stupid movie not start scene , but it contribute it . this review all you ghetto monkey morons who think because you ground effects obnoxious sounding muffler , somehow you transformed yourselves into mario andretti ferrari ; i some astounding news you , average citizen thinks you idiot license , should barred ever contributing human populus . no one impressed your driving antics endanger rest us roads highways . fact , everytime i read one you idiots died tragic accident due your own ignorance lack driving skills , i actually celebrate my friends , we relieve ourselves grave , because there one less stupid person road . rest world favor , save your money , don't make your car look stupid ghetto , which return , makes you look stupid ghetto , learn how drive safely , turn your hat around ( facing forward ) , pick up your retarded looking baggy pants , put belt , hide your underwear , ( no one wants see , but laughs you while you walk past ) speak normal language includes words besides " dawg " other non-understandable neanderthal sounds clearly indicate your lack education stupidity	-1
what superb cold-war action flick . it all-star cast , all male , many who became stars later . sean connery captain ramius new super sub " red october " . his stature legendary among all soviet submarine captains , but his lithuanian his wife died year earlier while he sea . he no children . officer crew sub hand picked him almost all men who personally loyal him . jack ryan here played alec baldwin one his best roles . he brilliant cia analyst rather than field officer knows submarines . because what develops , he brought cia chief admiral greer ( immortal national treasure james earl jones ) advise national security advisor pelt ( wonderful too soon lost richard jordan ) . there great deal confusion what americans , soviets , various crews various ships know . we , audience , know actual situation , but we concerned who learn what before or after it too late . what i like most this movie while there some heroics , they aren't superman kind stunts show up too many action flicks . people try what they it doesn't always work out without cost or even all well . end , well , you already know or should watch movie find out . i want single out terrific courtney vance sonar genius jones , scott glenn commander mancuso us sub dallas sam neill soviet captain borodin - 2nd ramius . fine performances each . even though ships big , shooting movie such confined quarters risks tedium claustrophobia ( which work film if handled well ) . this film focuses faces shows us people talking small groups so we see emotion their faces they struggle understand what going what should happen next . enjoy	1
even though this film released 1985 , now , more than 20 years later , it still highly entertaining . you get least few moments each character , develop feel them , come like them all . you really want see them succeed , suspense whether they or not constant . this movie good all ages , rated pg . cyndi lauper " goonies ' ' good enough " song nice touch . richard donner steven spielberg created magical movie enjoyed years come	1
i never read any tom clancy works , but i seen all movies made them . patriot games one them . storyline quite simple : jack ryan ( harrison ford ) , former cia analyst , vacation/lecture tour england his family . while way meet them near buckingham palace , he his family caught cross-fire during assassination attempt member royal family , lord holmes ( edward fox ) , rogue faction ira led sean miller ( sean bean ) . ensuing shoot-out , jack killed one terrorists , who happens sean younger brother . jack gets drawn back into cia after terrorists set out vengeful attack against his family back usa . my view , action sequences this movie not very exciting , when compared any recent bond /or bourne movies , although entire movie quite entertaining . i particularly enjoyed sequence showing real-time satellite-tracking session cia hq , during which jack his counter-terrorism team watching crack sas team conducting black ops raid terrorists ' hideout somewhere libya . accompanying music score realistically haunting ! what excites me most this movie watching jack exercising his astute power observation his uncanny ability juxtapose images relentless attempt track down whereabout rogue faction ira ,... high-tech resources cia counter-terrorism group , course . using vital information secured paddy o'neil ( richard harris ) , ira supporter usa , jack narrows down search through his observation/juxtaposition cia satellite images ( which includes overhead snapshot apparently capped woman pony tail ) his own recalled images : - back-view glimpse pony-tailed driver terrorists ' getaway vehicle during foiled assassination attempt england ; - side-view glance pony-tailed driver terrorists ' getaway vehicle during unsuccessful assassination attempt his life outside us naval academy ; all these associations triggered while taking break walking pass pony-tailed woman employee way answer call nature cia headquarters . what brilliant piece detective work - observation plus juxtaposition - part jack ! power observation juxtaposition obviously requisite character traits cia analyst . summing up this review , i enjoyed very much watching patriot games , experientially well educationally . this wonderful addition my resource repertoire	1

" green mile " expertly mixes film genres : it part prison flick , part supernatural mystery part drama . it adapted sephen king novel director/writer frank darabont released 1999 . if you're not admirer stephen king books/films ( i'm not ) don't let deter you viewing this beautiful-and-spiritually-profound film ; " green mile " no means typical horror story , although it couple horrific scenes . story : tom hanks plays head death row guard tennessee prison during depression . new inmate introduced , hulking black man named john coffey ( exquisitely played michael clarke duncan ) , who condemned death rape murder two little girls . hanks his guard friends slowly become intrigued seemingly pure-hearted giant begin realize he eminently gifted decidedly supernatural way ; they conclude there no way he could guilty crime . if that case , who guilty ? guilty party get away it .

i haven't seen 1937 version fred astaire , or 2004 version richard gere , but i don't really feel need see them now . this movie absolutely great . it very similar tampopo . after seeing this movie i checked amazon , they share their main actor ( kji yakusho ) so maybe it not coinceidence . shall we dance tampopo both someone changing their lives trying become proficient certain area ( dancing noodle cooking ) , both cases main characters older man younger woman , both movies tender japanese comedies satirize movie conventions japanese culture . difference tampopo , older man motivating training younger woman , shall we dance it younger woman who motivates train older man . yakusho plays role man stuck japanese work rut , who sees beautiful pensive woman window dance school every evening when he passes train . so he decides enroll able dance woman . way , it changes his life , way he sees other people , changes her life well . i especially liked fact conflict his wife handled realism tact , instead screaming fits " you're sleeping outside tonight " we've trained expect american television . real relief . which movie best , wow ! i can't decide ! tampopo little more substantial , but both wonderful . i'm going agonize over which movie nudge off my top 20 put this one	1
okay , i remember early 90 when nbc beating other networks hits like seinfeld , friends , this bigtime drama . well , this probably really big hit drama during early 90 no one forget . now , i don't recognize today er cast people seem more hollywood than struggling tv actors . so , this first season really defines heart drama tv which giving chance those struggling tv actors really shine . well , i guess george clooney only one break out er big success . others managed get out when scripts ran out steam after 4th or 5th season . well , dvd treatment this season pretty standard . although i would prefered nicer box set individual cases . anyways , dvd package fold-away stack double-sided dvds . yeah , this probably save cost so price would affordable . it annoying super careful but hey , fewer discs end . menus pretty much simple use some discs extras . my favorite looking bloopers final disc . also , interviews cast nice see how actors remember fondly their times er . picture quality episodes first rate seems almost perfect it tv . i don't any complaints transfer since everything looks crisp . so , there no overly dark scenes which difficult see . plus , audio well but i wished there english subtitles . sometimes , doctors , interns , nurses speak too fast action you want catch part their dialogue . this major letdown me since this should standard all us released dvd general ( tv , movies , etc ) . overall , this keeper i would recommend this watch again . you really get heart disciple-pupil relationship carter benton well some funny fiascos deb chen trying please benton . plus , dr. ross nurse hathaway plot full complications which more soapy stuff daytime . but , writers balanced it off operating table i think this season probably best my humble opinion . it makes me think if doctors watched er regular basis , then they would realize humanizing part doctors understanding patient what we really appreciate . well , i just hope my doctor turns out like susan lewis rather than peter benton	1
director david cronenberg creepy well . this may because he seems little creepy himself -- like stodgy , corduroy-wearing history professor who appears totally harmless but secretly likes handcuff women bedposts then place live tarantulas their naked torsos . i doubt director quite extreme , but it kind perversity colors most his movies , especially those made late ' 70s through 1980s . cronenberg second feature film , " rabid , " straddles horror sci-fi ( many his movies ) its story young woman , rose , who , after receiving some experimental skin grafts following horrific motorcycle accident , develops need human blood ( given rose played marilyn chambers , one might even say quot ; insatiablequot ; need blood ) . but it not your usual modern day vampire tale . starters , rose doesn't sprout fangs but rather orifice her armpit resembles inflamed sphincter , through which phallic looking proboscis emerges punctures victim . after which victim generally starts foaming mouth attacking whoever handy . before long , montreal under martial law its citizens become , well , you know ... though not cronenberg best movie , " rabid " holds up his later works like " scanners " " videodrome . " despite low budget , " rabid " some relatively convincing special effects , dreary location shots ( made drearier dank weather ) help establish overall feeling desolation . epidemic martial law aspects his story quite relevant today , if he'd played up plastic surgery angle bit more movie would triply prescient . ( imagine if " rabid " made today , then he could get cameos such surgically reconstructed celebs joan rivers , bruce jenner michael latoya jackson . ) cronenberg script lightly peppered his silly sense humor ( plastic surgeon named dr. keloid ; health minister advice avoiding rabies : " don't get bit " ) , but material played so seriously jokes dry irony rather than overt goofiness . still , all its merits , " rabid " probably wouldn't received nearly much attention it not stunt casting porn star chambers ( al adamson tried similar ploy when he cast georgina spelvin " i spit your corpse " ) . she actually pretty good this movie . commentary track cronenberg wonders why chambers didn't go star more mainstream movies , but this fact doesn't surprise me . even today , when ! entertainment channel regularly profiles porn stars , adult performers usually only cast mainstream movies joke or give low-budget films publicity boost . chambers may proved she could more film than just sex acts , but mainstream hollywood she'd always " just porn star . " extras ventura special edition disc not only include cronenberg commentary but 30-minute interview well . there also theatrical trailer written bios cronenberg chambers . wished chambers provided commentary well ( she even asked ? ) , but her absence hardly detrimental this dvd package . definite must fans david cronenberg , marilyn chambers low-budget creepiness .	-1

this film masterpiece - certainly best cartoon i ever seen , one very best films any genre - period . film stars family superheroes - parr - who forced into hiding because series ridiculous lawsuits ( bob parr : " i saved your life ! " , suicide guy : " no , you ruined my death ! " ) . crazy fan " i know all your moves " , who irritates bob point blunt rejection . ejector seat - spoof bond goldfinger movie . evil madman ( " syndrome " - set conditions pointing type disease ! ) owns island called " no-man-is-an " , many other jokes . it also fun contrast hilarious attempts family blend ( daughter violet : " normal - only one this family who normal jack-jack , he not even toilet trained ! " ) dangers they later face . bob longs days hero again , see him contain himself just hilarious , yet sympathetic same time . its interesting see them develop confidence , learn use their powers new ways . finally , i enjoyed seeing them learn work together family - transitioning mundane ( borderline dysfunctional ) formidable team . " jack jack attack " short movie disk 2 fits main film , also hilarious . early bond-style band music also suits film perfectly - even outdoes it . it could appeal some kids who attention span follow story , but i think it more appeal adults who admire creativity craftsmanship . worth multiple viewings . worth every penny	1

" not only martin caine characters both morally handicapped extreme , but martin gets play not one but two handicapped characters he works his cons : one wheelchair , other ( ruprecht ) .... well , i don't know exactly what ruprecht handicap , but i understand why he kept locked up his room . finally , this movie lovely look it , allowing you take fantasy trip french riviera , stay finest hotels villas , sip best champagne - that step up most movies these days right there . no explosions or violence . amazing .	1
ab bootcamp part billy blanks newest ( circa 2005 ) tae bo series , billy bootcamp . i've tae bo fan two years now , own many his early dvds , including original 4-pack , tae bo ii : get ripped ( still my favorite ) , ultimate abs/butt , ultimate upper/lower body . while i love early stuff , tae bo workouts he produced since switching studios ( ventura distribution good times entertainment ) seem more stylish , but considerably less difficult , than his earlier work . i especially disappointed tae bo cardio tae bo capture power series . however , i found myself growing bored what i , so i bit bullet bought tae bo bootcamp series . i'm happy say i don't regret my decision one bit ! unlike other bootcamp workouts , ab bootcamp not require " billy bands " ( pair elastic bands loop around your feet hands , thus adding considerable - almost impossible - resistance your workout ) . thus , you purchase this one dvd its own not worry buying extra equipmen t.t he workout runs 35 minutes length - boy , oh boy , what butt-kicking 35 minutes it ! always , billy starts out some stretching warm-ups . next up calisthenics , including series squats pelvic thrusts i've never seen tae bo before . class also spends good amount time horse stance ( squatting , butts thrust towards floor ) , arms up , torsos twisting side side . this really allows you concentrate your abs work waist . billy introduced this particular exercise many previous workouts , but never this much depth or such long period . you really feel your abs legs working here . finally , it down floor series crunches similar ab exercises . thankfully , billy mixes it up bit allocates some time stretching , which definitely takes edge off more extreme ab work . i've only ab bootcamp five times now , but i already notice difference my abs . i'm adding this one my regular rotation , no doubt . since it also slightly shorter than many other dvds i own ( 15 20 minutes ) , it good those mornings when you're running little late but still want squeeze decent workout . must anyone who wants work their abs ( who doesn't! ? ) . five stars all around ! - kelly garbato , tae bo junki	1
forget days when incubus simulated sounds rage against machine , korn or red hot chili peppers their post-grunge days . incubus moving forward their own brand originality , making " alive red rocks " must see . " fungus amongus " ( 1995 ) brought world funkier version rage against machine . 1997 " s.c.i.e.n.c.e. " huge step forward . although they jumped into whole rap-metal mess limp bizkit korn , record much more endearing , mainly due fact band hip-hop influence came dj opposed brandon boyd ( singer ) . " make yourself " ( 1999 ) showed incubus really settling into their sound , reminiscent red hot chili peppers ' funk-rock style , sounding much more comfortable than their past efforts . it also their most successful mainstream hit date . lessons " make yourself " definitely apply their follow-up 2001 release " morning view " , where they ditch nu-metal/rap-metal sound focus expanding sounds " make yourself " . " crow left murder " marks their most significant welcomed change years . you don't get sense incubus sounds like other bands this record , it simply sounds like incubus ; fresh , original mind-blowing . if you like myself , welcoming change artistically growing band , not whining how they should return rap/metal days " s.c.i.e.n.c.e. " , you just gonna love this dvd ! everyone band pulls their weight flawlessly this concert . every member gets their jaw dropping moments shine show . brandon boyd never sounded better , hitting those highs , lows everything cleaner clearer than ever . ben kenney ( former roots bassist ) shows why he definitely man job , turning out gnarly bass solos , sweet drum solo percussion jaunt featured " vitamin " . jos pasillas shocked hell out me his killer drum solo also featured " vitamin " . he much more talented drummer than i first thought . i don't even know where start guitarist mike einziger . i've seen two other incubus shows dvd , mike baffled me this time . he always fantastic guitarist , but you never realize how good he actually until you hear him belt out solos songs like " priceless " " sick , sad little world " . i awe speed , timing precision he displayed . since incubus " jam band " side them , those solos get stretched out like mad , making it even more enjoyable than album versions . one main reasons i bought this dvd see how well mike would able pull off solo " sick , sad little world " ; you not disappointed . this definitely incubus ' quintessential live performance . no die hard incubus fan would missing this dvd their discography	1

this film its place " ground breaking " idea . it comedy placed , subtle genuinely funny . some films , such star trek , trying come up warped ideas 100% time . good food-for-thought , but it get tedious towards end series . i truly enjoyed watching groundhog day 2nd time , which probably enough any film - otherwise it starts become groundhog day our own . after first time i came away feeling whole purpose our hero win bedroom conquest . second thoughts it not so gratuitous ( mainly because it isn't overdone ) . but it still seems strange it aim whole plotline . why can't they simply fall love then groundhog day over	1

i liked but didn't love first two mi films . first artsy but somewhat convoluted not well-paced . second exciting extreme , but bloated , pretentious ( e.g. signature john woo doves ) lacking any sort subtlety , we've seen other woo films ( e.g. face/off ) . mi :3 feels completely different than its predecessors , thanks writing directing jj abrahms , creator " alias " " lost . " you see his style all over this film . best way describe mi :3 this : first half like really , really good episode " alias , " but $50 million budget . second half like really , really good episode " 24 " , but $50 million budget . if you like both these exciting tv shows , i am pretty sure you like mi :3 lot . i know tom cruise lost lot folks ' goodwill , couch-jumping hysterics , his totally out-of-line comments brooke shields ' post partum depression , other high profile screw-ups . it would totally understandable if you didn't want bother his films anymore . but i respectfully ask you cut him little slack , just 120 minutes , just long enough enjoy this film . it worth it , trust me !	-1
i first saw this movie high school theater . i extremely moved film , it triggered facination south asia lasts this day - i even work half year sri lanka now . so me , personally , this movie tremendous influence . i understand arguements crediting non-white actors ; i always wondered why candice bergman given top billing , given she only appears very few scenes . well , that way world - it marketing right or wrong , get people into theater you highlight those who well known . it not right , but that hollywood . i mean , better unfair credits than not movie all , yes ? you've got admit , it quite debut ben kingsly . wow . he'll forever known this role . aside , this excellent , amazing film . course , it still highly relevant , perhaps even more so our post-911 world fear . movie ends feeling real hope inspiration . must-see anyone who feels anger , fear , agressively nationalistic , hopelessness , hatred , or lost . i think several politicans who need see this movie	1
if you're going parody countless number straight teen comedies , least make your movie funnier smarter than they . this movie neither doesn't credit its audience any intellect whatsoever . i nothing against lowbrow comedy , but jokes gags here just plain tired . over-douching yourself point constant crapping funny anyone over age 12 ? jokes gerbils nambla - c'mon . i know i'll get hell taking my gay self too seriously , but gerbil jokes nambla equated gay offensive . maybe if their respective jokes funny i'd feel differently , but they anything but . just stupid . if there redeeming factor this movie , it attractive actors , but that really it .	-1
absolutely great ! i love this movie when i saw it here i get it . delivered quickely . no damages . overall 5 stars	1
well , my kids really enjoy this movie . they actually sit through whole movie they only 2 3 1/2 . i don't want make too many comments adults because i'm sure most adults aren't going buy this just themselves . i wouldn't recommend but if you looking movie please your kids then i'd highly recommend this movie . i think all kids up age 8 or so would enjoy this movie . basically story this little boy all sudden finds he hear everything dogs say . supposedly there planet out there made up all dogs hubble boy dog just sent there grade dogs earth . so , like i said this movie i'd recommend kids but adults might think it little far-fetched .	-1
first , let me start off saying i think casting choices this movie perfect . i doubts movie would any good , because i'm not exactly fan jennifer lopez acting , but she brilliant job playing her par t.t he movie great sensual dance seens , substantial , interesting storyline go it . i'm addicted dance movies , anyone who says dance movie older people it can't good definitely wrong . richard gere amazing . this movie rocked	-1
its own terms , this movie winner . why it totally true history or not , actors today cannot this believable . performances universally convincing . made 1985 , why it everyone this movie put their heart into their performance , thus i mesmerized delighted . when you shed tear these young people caught up tragedy political manipulation , it no more than tears these young actors , so convincing so deeply rendered . how i wish i could own twenty films like this one !	1
what it don mckellar why you keep seeing him movies ? he represent some sort canadian triple threat like orson welles usa ? all through two hours childstar i kept wondering casting agents who said , " perfect fit our don mckellar ! " those you who don't know who i'm talking , he every canadian movie manages cross border us -- so called " nylon curtain . " he little bit like woody allen , his constant stream backtalk non sequiturs nerdy intellectual appeal . except don more fit , almost like real star , good figure hint hard muscle . opposite him , jennifer jason leigh more appealing than i've ever seen her movie , she beautiful too , almost though she some sort plastic surgery soul , how old she now , she still young , but she gorgeous here driven " stage mother " determined prove old cliche wrong . her little boy , taylor brandon burns , huge us sitcom star who acts up fictional show called family differences son omnipresent but goodhumored alan thicke . toronto lures him promise big screen glory " first son " ludicrous action movie aimed tweens which he gets save entire western world drive fighter plane rescue dad , potus , cabal evildoers who him tied up riding chair air force one . if " first son " more entertaining than tired satire childstar , who says you choose ? you get both movies you get more them than you want , anyhow . i like , wtf don mckellar , but now i know he good me . sign me up whatever club he stands	-1
i thought movie great ! van damme not getting any younger he getting older well maybe he can't kick like he use . but he very sincere actor . i seen greater performances his earlier movies . i give him credit , he still kicking butt he darn good angle when he kicks . any true fan would not put actor down . give me break he only human . jean-claude van damme you great actor my book . although i would like see you play more love scene movie . kiss you vivica . fox great !!!! stay strong baby	1
i travel work , so i often rely fitness dvds help me stay shape . i've only working out seriously few months , this dvd definitely too easy me . there 2 cardio workouts , 5 toning work outs , warm up , cool down , all over toning workout . this seems great , but when you actually look details , you'll see cardio workouts only 13 minutes each , toning workouts only 5 minutes each . so when you actually look pre-set workouts ( without warm up cool down ) , you're only getting 20 minutes real exercise . i would say this good dvd if you've never exercised or you really out shape . but even if you've exercising little while , you'll probably find it too easy . i strongly recommend method cardio bootcamp , or 10 minute solutions carb burner , or 10 minute solutions pilates . all three these videos give you ability choose your workouts or combine smaller segments into longer workout . if you're looking good toning workout , try self bikini ready fast .	-1
i actually bought this dvd because virginia madsen just seen " sideways " . i won't re-hash plot amazon already provided potential buyers outline . however , while madsen all members cast great don johnson real revelation here . his acting nothing short superb complex part required him demonstrate wide emotional range slick cynicism tenderness , homicidal rage/grief abject confusion smart operator who thoroughly out played . looks plus smarts plus intention equal sex appeal . no wonder women fought over him .	1

" logan run " great nostalgic 1970s science fiction . 70s great era sci-fi , where future viewed optimism , awe wonder , unlike digital-age , cookie-cutter sci-fi we get today , offers nothing but gloom doom . i just little kid when " logan run " first released , but i remember blown away it premise -- futuristic society young people living inside futuristic domed-city , where you're not allowed live past age 30 . there really no where runners ( those who refuse end their lives 30 voluntarily ) go elude sandmen ( city police ) , outside domed-city post-apocalyptic , laid ruins earth outside-somewhere near old city washington . .. michael york plays logan 5 , one sandmen who turns out more heart than city would probably prefer . richard jordan ( francis 7 ) his fellow sandman/friend who fiercely loyal city status quo , begins doubts logan loyalty this status quo after he finds logan hanging around nursery . reason all this you'll find out when you watch movie . i actually wish they shown more domed-city than they . it really cool-looking structure , fascinating sci-fi concept . but you see exterior aerial visual-effects shots city movie opening , then few glimpses afterward , but after opening shots , movie quickly gets story surrounding characters , lot scenes take place sets scenes location . like redressed shopping malls , because indoor malls new 70 , people still fascinated these indoor shopping arenas , so it made sense redress one these new malls represent interior futuristic city . but miniatures built exterior aerial shots domed-city really cool look . some people , probably younger people who grew up this cgi age , ridicule film city looking fake like model . yeah , if you squint , you makes out few imperfections , but so what ? minatures look spectacular their time . but all dated aspects this film what makes it all more interesting . imperfection more interesting than perfection anyway . but " logan run " one last sci-fi epics . those stand-alone films like grand mgm stamp them . everything today so cookie-cutter bland , production companies you've never heard putting out direc t-t o-dvd caliber movies faster than bic corporation putting out pens . it just not same anymore . but definately purchase " logan run " dvd . it even better viewing it widescreen , it shown theaters	-1

i not seen this movie years , recently added it my netflix list . i forgot how much i enjoyed this movie first time i viewed it . based best-selling book , eagle landed very entertaining . cast strong action pretty non-stop . michael caine , robert duval , larry hagman all provide excellent performances . negative side , movie little long today standards , donald sutherland character somewhat over . but , it fun follow twists plot progresses , realize end no one really wins . fictional german plot kill churchill prevented , some crack german paratroopers all die . if you like movies such where eagles dare guns navarone , you probably enjoy eagle landed well	1
" lie me " sexually charged love story somehow got away mpaa rating . i think filmmakers must mpaa , because this movie got some graphic scenes . we're talking full frontal male female nudity , sex looks very unsimulated . you don't see full penetration , but ... well , you'll see it . this movie adapted book i hope book more depth than this , because i feel something must lost transition book-to-screen . movie leila ( lauren lee smith ) , girl lot people would call " slut . " leila likes sex she likes it lot . she doesn't seem understand love or relationship , but she understands sex . could this attributed bad homelife ? it could , but filmmakers don't really show her bad homelife . her parents getting divorced her sister get married , despite sex her ex just couple nights before marriage . it kind bad , but not this bad . anyway , leila ends up party where she hastily drags guy outside begins performing oral sex him . meanwhile , guy she met few minutes ago named david ( eric balfour , ' texas chainsaw massacre ' ) sitting truck watching her his girlfriend . girlfriend begins copying leila both leila david sex their respective partners ; they look each other something there . they may not sure what , but it there . next day , david goes looking leila he finds her . she begins masturbate playground him , which freaks him out bit , but he returns her they both sex i swear isn't simulated . there almost no way it could . anyway , some reason ; we find out david caring his invalid father . but this really important plot ? i mean it bit heartwrenching , but not very important . this movie could've poignant , but that where it misses . performances good enough movie entertaining ; it vast improvement over sexually charged movie called " 9 songs " ( which sex wasn't simulated slightly more graphic than this ) . balfour smith make cute couple ; sex scenes great . but , overall , it misses bit . grade : b-	-1

i cannot believe how many negative reviews this film actually received . they watching same movie i watching ? i generally concider myself very critical when it comes political thrillers such " sentinel " , so i am not going just generally give such movie one my favorite genres high rating automatically without giving it some fore-thought . " sentinel " everything intense , well-crafted political thriller should . acting quite convincing suspense riveting . i guarantee you pinned edge your seat through entire film then some . also , scenario extremely plausible , especially today world , all militant groups out there -- neo-nazis islamic radicals -- who would stop nothing make assination attempt or terrorist attack against president or some u.s. institution . my advice , before listening negative rants other reviewers this film , go ahead take look it yourself . it safe bet you not disappointed .	1

i've seen this movie time time since 1970 , but , image entertainment dvd , i feel like i'm seeing it first time -- it good ! picture my public domain dvd ( which i just threw out ) basically looked like few light areas ( faces , lamps , etc . ) surrounded large black areas no details - actually , i should say large dark gray areas no details . it often hard see where characters what they doing . picture image dvd much-closer-to-normal gray scale shows much finer detail . you see things shadows . gray scale still isn't quite up modern standards , but i'm sure that not image fault . you're watching 85-year-old movie . they used best print they could find , it vast improvement over anything else i've seen . there string quartet score which works very well movie . if you didn't know better , you'd think it original score . they recreated expressionist style original intertitles , even added some " digi-dirt " make them better match rest film . translation doesn't use obscure words like " mountebank " " fakir , " like my public domain copy . ( yes , course you look them up , but who wants run dictionary while they're watching movie ? )plus , it tinted match original . helps this movie lot , because its odd sets , it often hard tell if scene set indoors or out , or if it day or night . picky i am , i didn't find frame line too distracting ! it not many scenes . i'm glad they allowed us see whole picture , rather than cropping shots . i haven't seen kino version , so i can't compare two , but i recommend this version without reservations	1

it ability see dead people ? yes , sense . but broader sense , it ability see invisible , non-sensory forces motivate people behaviors . movie , sense manifested child ability see " ghosts , " ability see undead people whose souls not rest , still troubled what they perceive mistakes their past . many children adults gifted ability " see " what other people cannot see , ability see what read lines 5 normal senses . 6th sense sensory skill improved through effort education . it often learned best watching socially intelligent women who suffered greatly decided try find ways understand care those hurting around them . 6th sense empathy . if tree falls woods , no one around , it still heard empathetic people . those us who understand grief losing someone , pains not diminish after they pass away prematurely . time passing not ease pain . intoxicants not kill pain . we never stop remembering their light , their humor , their hopes , our loss connection . like ghosts , best sense term , we see them regularly revisit us . this great film these , many more universal reasons	1

someone well versed various kinds literature , someone who read ( enjoyed ) almost all tom clancy novels , professional videographer , i say , this great flick . those who upset adaptation , what you expect ? when taking 800 plus page book condensing it down two hour movie , some things going change . second third clancy movies- especially clear present danger - also adapted give harrison ford action spotlight . but now ford ageing , paramount ( who after all , business needing turn profit ) needed re-invent franchise . move make it not just new actor , but show it start jack ryan career cleverly . most all , it held true idea book , when we base our actions off our fears suspicions , our peace torn apart few depraved individuals . this movie falls into category action/thriller . such , not everything true life , but instead designed entertainment suspense . it delivers . something action category it remarkably intelligent script . it little slow beginning those who looking nothing more than explosions shootouts , but it worth it . it also better than average cinematography compared most action flicks . effects well not all cheesy , many action flicks taught us expec t.t he acting well-done , typically good performance affleck stellar performance freeman . soundtrack also fantastic , especially rendition national anthem football game . bottom line , if you're reader who expects movies scripts written like books , don't see this movie . if you accept literature movies entirely different formats entertainment then you'll probably enjoy this movie , it certainly worth ownin	1
i'm avid reader , always , but i've felt kind burned out reading late , who wouldn't after reading hundreds hundreds books , one after , usually reading two books time , several books week ? also , my schedule no longer allows me freedom read much i used . why i decided watch this film when netflix sent it me despite fact i hadn't read nicholas sparks novel first . now i wish i'd read book . this one most beautiful tear-jerking stories i seen ! everyone who knows me knows i'm sucker stories pull heart strings . they also know stories centered star-crossed lovers my major weakness . most my all-time favorite books movies those characteristics common . i won't go into details plot because i don't want give away spoilers potential viewers ( though i'm sure many people already ) -- all i say you cannot go wrong this film if you're hopeless romantic . actors wonderful . ryan gosling rachel mcadams transmit all right emotions flawless job characterization . they add great deal depth range their characters i can't imagine better actors roles . gena rowlands also wonderful older allie . i like 1940s setting backdrop -- however brief -- second world war . wardrobe , settings , scenery cinematography flawless . dvd great investment . widescreen edition makes viewing all more pleasurable . i cannot recommend notebook enough . i don't know if i'll read book because i don't like reading novels after i watched their film adaptations , but i definitely read other nicholas sparks novels not-so-distant future	1

brilliant companion piece swimming pool , francois ozon under sand similarly casts charlotte rampling lead female , here tale loss . interestingly , both films , she position someone not only literate but directly involved literature . swimming pool , she writer ; here , she instructor literature . this key understanding how subtle ozon these two masterful films . parallel both works fusing fantasy reality . under sand , marie ( rampling ) husband disappears her fantasy life -- reinforced , it implied , her profession -- blossoms into imagining her husband still her , long after his disappearance , , well , feeling hands stroking all parts her body one amazing scene . more subtly , ozon here , swimming pool , uses mix french english -- both language culture -- emphasize blurring fantasy reality . when marie best friend -- like her , bilingual english woman married french man -- speaks her , it sometimes french , sometimes english , indicating fluidity thought feeling two modes existence . marie friend sympathizes her loss -- french -- but wants her face up reality what happened continue her life -- english . similarly , marie new lover tells her he thinks english morbid . but he french tells her this french ; it shows , ozon says , there desire french feel deeply , contrasted english who desire think deeply . such implication here . marie french , though born english , it just this fusing two cultures within herself results her confusion fantasy reality . however , it would too easy equate french fantasy english reality ; ozon not really this simplistically above seems indicate . instead , he imply this several scenes , but well shows us marie telling her friend , english , jean ( her lost husband ) taking nap or out walk when he not her year or so . , marie herself not able distinguish difference two cultures flowing her blood -- not able differentiate simply all difference fantasy reality , thought feeling . this brought head great ending sequence , not revealed here , which jean , perhaps , not lost after all . or he ? ozon superbly intelligent filmmaker who closely investigates what how we think feel , delicately exposing nuances behavior how they determine who we really . subtlety shown his work truly astonishing marks him one great french directors working today	1

this canadian film ( set british columbia ) tells story young working class woman who learns she fast-growing , untreatable cancer dead within months . oddly enough , she decides not tell anyone ( how she stand it ? ) instead makes list things she wants before she dies . much film involves affair she ( character played mark ruffalo ) -- she her first child 17 , her husband her first only , so she wants broaden her experience life before she dies . i think way she handles this news her impending death odd probably unfair people she loves ( she doesn't see it way ) , i think someone who real life would leave lot angry people behind , who never chance say things they wanted say . but this film , after all , it credible someone would this . she , after all , very young very young don't always make great choices . if you watch this film others , i think you'll find lots talk . don't watch it if you're already feeling depressed , because it sad movie many ways .	-1

when i walzted into blockbuster other day(but like any other day ) i head straight anime section . avid fan anime , i plunge headlong into any anime and/or manga , knowing relativley nothing it . so , my sister i stood pondering over which dvd grab(we there well over ten minutes ) we snatched whatever looked least hlfway decent , it just happened appleseed escaflowne . we portable dvd player car , , because i knew alittle bit appleseed , we watched first . holy crap(excuse my bluntness ) but i amazed thoroughly enjoyed mysef . really great movie , but that beside point . so when we finally return home , i good mood hadhigh hopes escaflowne would good too , although i never heard it . we popped dvd began watch . well , my sister very imature kept commenting hitomi nose . ahh ... she so annoying , but i didn't care particularly how character looked . it seemed intresting beginning , how hitomi persieved life , it made sense how she felt . then wierd stuff began . i guess because i haven't watched tv series , i didin't really understand gaia all . wasn't much history movie , so i didn't understand hw everything tied . anyway , i liked van his relationship his brother i like van . . . alot . but i found hitomi rather annoying , constatly damsel distress beckoning aid others complaining her mundane lifestyle ... well , i could go one one . dragon armor , escaflowne cool , i liked raw savagnss fight armours end . but there just something kept me really likeing it . there good premise movie , but it almost poorly executed . writing hitomi absolutly horendous . trust me , there numerous accounts which she repeated same thing over over , which i would understand if she contradicting herself , but it more reasuring herself out loud everything . consistantly annoying . it almost good , so i give it 4 out 5 . but my sister would give it much , much less	-1

disney really gave this film ar t-t reasure treatment . film nearly 50 years old , but colors glow sound wonderful . painstaking frame-by-frame restoration conducted , soundtrack remastered , resulting film which probably looks better now dvd than when it originally released . this film always favorite mine all disney classics , i think music lot it .

real women curves story ana ( played america ferrera ) , latina teenager , during summer her 18th year . ana beautiful . hourglass figure melon breasts , full lips long thick hair . she intelligent strong willed but held back her family , especially her mother who constantly berates her because her physical appearance . ana lives her family east los angeles mexican community but she goes high school beverly hills ; feat she accomplished her own . story begins ana getting ready her last day high school . her mother feigns sick get her stay home but ana doesn't fall it heads off school showing immediately strained relationship these two women emphasis ana places education . ana mother , carmen ( played lupe ontiveros ) old school ; she started working her family when she thirteen . she married young became mother . work family her life . she wants same ana wants ana want same which odd scenario because most story mom want more their children . carmen constantly insults ana her weight front everyone . story moves it becomes more disturbing . estela ( played ingrid oliu ) ana adult sister . she still lives home runs sewing factory where they all work , estela fashion design . they make dresses bloomingdales , getting $18 dress when store sells them $600 . this infuriates ana well fact they never make dresses bigger than size 7 . estela many heavy weights beside physical weight she carries . she fighting keep factory open , pay rent , get dresses made time satisfy buyers keep her employees working despite inability pay them their wages . three employees move back mexico estela ana promise stay help recent order . ana unknowing help , estela steps outside box begins designing her own dresses . special gift , she makes special red gown ana , regrettably we never get see ana it . like ana but lesser degree , carmen berates estella . it during one these time carmen mentions love , " it because i love you i make your life so miserable . " estela replies , love me less . george lopez makes appearance ana teacher , mr. guzman . he encourages her go college , helps her fill out her college application makes special visit plead ana parents let her go college when she offered full scholarship columbia . although small role , lopez character effective nurturing teacher looking help woman his own community . best scene movie when women factory , strip their underwear expose their secrets . it all starts when ana can't take heat factory any longer removes her shirt cool herself . her mother freaks , telling her she too fat show much her body . ana not ashamed or afraid her body she lets her mother know it . other women factory back her up . they begin share their body parts how they feel it . they take off their clothes which further infuriates carmen . " this who we " yells ana , " real women . " they all celebrate each other ( without carmen ) go back work their underwear after carmen walks out . this seen easily shows how ana estela evolve while carmen seems trapped her bitterness insecurities . she opportunity bond her daughters , women , chooses not . it very exhilarating watch . real women curves worth seeing this scene alone . throughout movie laced lots peppy mexican music shots mexican community . there subtitles family members but it isn't distracting enough cumbersome adds angst family . i love this little film strong willed girl transition teenager into woman . america ferrera plays part ana confident teenager who devilish side egging her mother . she still insecurities discover conquer . it easy love her , her sister even her mother . i would liked estela storyline expanded hers interesting character . most importantly this film success success characters not contingent ana losing weight finding true love happy . real women curves movie not only latina women but , i think , girls women everywhere battling views others how they should feel their bodies . original review posted http://largeandlovely.bellaonline.co	-1
better title this cheap-budget film " staying lame , " since it nothing more than shell plot featuring two well-known actors . when i say actors , i may stretching it bit , since samuel . gives wooden performance every time , while ben " good hunting " affleck performed best lo arm candy . but movie pitiful back-and-forth revenge saga , unbelievable , reminiscent ping-pong match . it " firm " wannabe , bruce willis entendre copy not worth $4 it cost rent your local video rental store . hopefully , one day , both main actors go acting school , or better yet , stop making movies altogether . but then , there always remake " gone fishin '" starring danny glover joe pesci would perfect sammy benny . , or both could act together inside jaba hutt costume final prequel star wars . just don't expect me rent it when it comes out .	-1

" memento " eclipses everything which preceded it , set bar so high it may never topped . all $5 million production costs . director nolan remarkable job juggling complex plot elements , but sabotages himself some his rather ordinary visual schemes . i refer you diner sequence which characters portrayed guy pearce joe pantoliano converse over soup . given film shot panavision 2.35 : 1 anamorphic process , scene would played more effectively if nolan simply planted his camera medium shot two skillful actors they provided plot exposition . instead , nolan intercuts close ups two , which method more typical appropriate narrower aspect ratio television . close ups work best when used judiciously provide emphasis . i mention this only because this how detailed i go order find fault film . if i didn't know better i would swear pearce american actor -- his accent authentic . all performances convincing it always fun see " eve 6 " ( harriet sansom harris ) great " x-files " episode . this film proof morally bankrupt notion movies cost $200 miilion or more . i am sick ugly , witless , loud blockbusters which polluting pop culture . if choice spend sort money making movie ... or allow movie go unmade ...

i purchased this season trepidation i dubious changes casting i loved previous 8 seasons richard dean anderson rest . humour excellent each episode most enjoyable leaving me always wanting more . well , imagine my surprise when i watched first few episodes find changes not detracted show all but made it every bit good before . writers etc not tried replace o'niell character but introduced new dynamic some excellent humour . episodes very good while i still 4 episodes watch , i am hoping rumours show cancelled after season 10 not true . i watch this show long it available . ( i watch dvd i not get show tv here ) . i love new humour all cast transition gou'ald ori interestingly handled . it also great see team not always succeed , but i hope they eventually overcome ori . extras , i enjoyed those i watched , but i generally not buy dvds extras rather show/movie . extras bonus . i would heartily recommend this season any stargate fans out there who dubious due cast change . those who yet watch eny episode , rather watch first 8 seasons first , then this one there references past incidents flash backs not likely make sense if you haven't seen them . roll next season !!!!	1
there really so much say this movie , condensing it all into short review impossible . put it simply possible , brokeback mountain work art slowly almost subliminally works its way into your psyche , refusing hint or portray its message until very end , which point your emotions virtually devastate you . storyline pretty well-known now . jack ennis , two 19-year-old ranch hands , hired early 1960 tend flock sheep atop grazing grounds brokeback mountain montana . jack , son overly strict distant father , quick make friends laugh , while ennis , orphan raised his brother sister , shy , withdrawn , almost gun-shy society . during course summer , jack gradually draws ennis out his shell two unexpectedly start sexual relationship . end summer , each goes their own way start traditional families , but cannot deny feelings they each other . they then maintain 20-year romance through camping fishing trips several times year . execution this movie near flawless ! cinematography so beautiful points , it almost too much eyes comprehend . musical score understated feels perfectly home within film . direction near perfect . film never loses focus two actors ... opening scene end , this movie them . supporting characters never dismissed , though attention not focused them , they nonetheless memorable without ever stealing scenes actors . only drawback film makeup . 2nd part film takes place over span 20 years , shows actors gradually aging 19 39 . makeup isn't quite up job make these young actors appear middle-aged weathered . all honesty though , i'm not sure any makeup anywhere fully pull off . actors , jake gyllenhall heath ledger played their roles beautifully . it quickly becomes apparent actors chose these parts not money , nor any fame ( it never meant released major film ) , but rather because they believed story wanted portray their characters best they could . jake gives life jack refreshingly wonderful manner , heath disappears , leaving behind withdrawn , shell-shocked ennis . movie progresses very slow pace . it never boring , but throughout one wonders where film going what it trying say . sentiment continues grow almost threatens lose you audience member until last 20 minutes or so . point , plot takes sudden surprisingly-devastating turn . it surprisingly devastating because you simply don't expect made such emotional connection characters , but found you . film reaches it emotional impact , it becomes achingly apparent it woven itself under your skin now part you ... it its claws you not letting go . it climaxes , you're left rush emotion surprises you few films ever able garner . it point where you realize purpose everything previously film . entire film leadup one simple message , one simple premise . it gut-wrenching realization end lingers your mind long after you've walked away screen . movie honest . it documents portrays . it makes no statement or against homosexuality . it unapologetic , yet compassionate . it all-time classic	1

what you say columbo , unassuming bungling , yet brilliant sleuth who always gets his man or woman . part brilliance this series murder occurs beginning episode . columbo then called scene crime his annoying ultimately endearing manner slowly unravels mystery . it becomes obvious early columbo uncanny instincts , intelligence experience handle job almost always suspect mind . murders ingenious sometimes umpremeditated , yet murderers all ultimately incrimminate themselves their own behavior many clues they drop way . when columbo finally nabs his mouse after long determined pursuit , he then reveals them their one fatal mistake which led their undoing . while there no class distinction crime , it certainly more interesting watching accomplished often brilliant individuals extraordinary settings than common street thugs drug dealers . you learn wealthy their problems just like everyone else often victimized themselves . impressive settings , creative plots excellent performances , all directed renowned film makers sure stimulate your mind senses columbo destined remain delight small screen . season four just engaging first three seasons i personally difficult time deciding which i like best . columbo series hits its stride early remains consistently good several seasons come . you can't miss here quality never falters columbo never fails deliver . only exception me episode mrs. columbo which i never liked . other than , you're safe selecting this great addition your collection or first many seasons you inevitably want .	1

this past august , i bought soundtrack pete townsend 1989 musical iron man , which also based ted hughes 1968 novel , impressed not only mr. townsend artistry , but also wisdom message its songs conveyed individual selections entire album just plain fun listen . naturally , i thus came thinking maybe this motion picture , which released whole decade after particular cd , would likely appeal my imagination same way musical would , i only opportunity see latter presentation myself . unfortunately , i found out how wrong i when i rented this rightfully less-than-appreciated flick last weekend forced myself sit through it . now , i'll admit , animation definitely something worthy applause ; that one thing i'll give iron giant credit . however , that far my praise this movie goes . i'll also admit it didn't follow exact same lines either book or musical , but then again , i expecting case . rather , it overall tone film earned my enmity . begin , though i am well aware many animated features other family-themed features contain occasional sight gag or adul t-t hemed joke , tig seemed heavily punctuated them , beatnik scrap-sculptor dean mcchoppin unzipping his fly let young hogarth hughes " pet " squirrel escape his pants " bathroom " scene where hogarth tries cover robot hand it exits hughes home -- latter scene which least two instances what one could easily call " toilet-bowl humor . " not only , but i found protagonist himself just most obnoxious repulsive example lead character i ever come know : loud , unruly , disobedient brat reminiscent all four young charlie bucket tourmates willie wonka chocolate factory who tries pass himself off more depth than he really . honestly , he not what i would call " amiable , " " heart-warming , " or even " cute " ; such adjectives i'd rather reserve wide-eyed , honest , poverty-stricken mr. bucket . course , it not like i really appreciated any other human characters this flick , either -- not little mr. hughes ridiculously clueless diner waitress mother annie , nor deadbeat wannabe " artist " dean , nor even inept government agent whose name i completely ( yet thankfully ) forgotten despite his most complex earthling participant entire cartoon . such , only hundred-foo t-t all , metal-munching robot -- softhearted self-maintaining ( if nonetheless hopelessly brain-damaged ) extraterrestrial who no memory all his origin -- impressed me . even so , movie portrayed poor guy so incredibly dimwitted ( opposed haplessly misguided tad naive , which i hoping he'd come off ) effort make him likeable kids audience i ended up pitying him more than anything else . needless say , then , much i tried grapple each every one these elements they presented themselves , i merely found it harder harder get over accept them all collective whole , i ended up returning this movie video store utter disgust . believe me , ladies gentlemen , i really tried appreciate iron giant , but despite my efforts trying see side story its fans see it , all naught , now i am left asking myself just why i even bothered rent it first place . after all , it known one number very unpopular motion pictures 1999 , good reason : it caters very low level mentality , even amongst underdeveloped minds kids whom it made . tragically , so many other movies these days , regardless how successful or unsuccessful they -- current , seven-plus-year-long fad honestly disturbs me gets me wondering sensibility average person these days . worse yet how movie plagued such lowbrow buffoonery this one would " special edition " dvd five years after its initial release -- especially considering how allegedly few people actually seen it . oh , well ... i still wish i could've seen pete townsend iron man musical . least would something worth witnessing	-1

" adventures spin marty " title refers first season ( 1955-56 ) show ; second third seasons given modified title . when originally broadcast total running time 275 minutes broken into 25 episodes shown part first year " mickey mouse club " . show broadcast monday-friday 5pm-6pm . serials structured mild cliffhanger format teaser end enticing viewers watch next episode resolution . when they shown few years ago " vault disney " episodes paired up provide 22-23 minute running time . if you grew up original mmc you already know serials like this most anticipated part show " spin marty " far most popular . reason their popularity no mystery , they only kid shows those days featured kids instead puppets or animation . if you not around " spin marty " phenomenon , think it 1950 version " saddle club " , both featured kids getting spend all their time horses . but instead girls hanging out pine hollow stables , here it boys living bunk houses " triple " , dude ranch summer camp . who wouldn't like spending entire summer ranch , riding horses far away parental supervision ? first season story adapted novel " marty markham " lawrence watkin . show went rapidly downhill after first season so it no great tragedy only season one out dvd . mostly this because writers never able duplicate charm first season premise . but show also fell victim kevin corcoran curse . corcoran terminally precocious little actor disney tried make star inserting him into this popular show start second season . corcoran unbearably bad actor damage compounded disney insistence manipulative showcasing his terminal cuteness ; especially bad fit show whose first season appeal its naturalness understated performances cast . like " saddle club " first season , it revolves around new kid who difficulty fitting ranch . marty markham ( david stollery ) overprotected orphaned rich kid who arrives his grandmother chauffeured limousine his own butler ( perkins-j . pat o'malley-who detailed help ranch cook ) immediately manages offend all boys calling triple-r ranch " smelly old farm " . rivalry soon develops spin evans ( tim considine ) , popular boy who work all year pay attendance costs . marty afraid horses but lies polo player . considine stollery both convincing although stollery more difficult part . supporting cast boys appropriate nicknames ; lazy " ambitious " , freckled " speckle " chunky " russell muscle " . special effects bit weak ( like woodchuck chase scene where you accept ball fur pulled though field string woodchuck ) campfire scenes obvious day night shooting . harry carey jr. roy barcroft provide sympathetic concerned authority figures but my favorite insightful horse trainer ollie ( leonard geer ) who always seemed nine days worth stubble repeatedly said : " well i'll blue-nosed gopher " . predictably marty learns love horses get other boys . he breaks his arm but perkins able keep news his grandmother so he not sent home early . there all great summer camp elements bears ghost stories . two-disc dvd set photo gallery , interviews , little feature called " return triple-r " ; which includes adult considine stollery visiting ranch where most show filmed . then again , what i know ? i'm only child	1

new world least terrence malick limited filmography date , could best described monotone poem . it not exactly bad , just mundane rather forgettable even while you're watching it , more self-indulgence than genuine attempt communicate audience . visually it often seems surprisingly flat uninspired , while script comprises far too many trite voice over questions s-p-o-k-e-n v-e-r-y s-l-o-w-l-y i-n h-u-s-h-e-d t-o-n-e-s against selections his classical music collection , which doesn't magically render them profound but simply makes film evenly paced point where nothing stand out : even battle sequence takes time out more musings . big problem miscasting inexplicably prolific colin farrell , nice enough lad offscreen i'm sure but extraordinarily limited actor who just cannot carry picture no matter how many chances he given . true form he trots out his two `important picture ' expressions - bambi-caught-in-the-headlights-of-an-oncoming-car one one he thinks looks serious but simply makes him look like he not getting enough roughage his diet . fact he outshone q'orianka kilcher her first speaking part speaks volumes his inadequacy , although fair he worse . indeed , among male leads christian bale much , much more much , much less last third film , typically underused christopher plummer first third . malick very good madness mutiny infects deluded settlers jamestown , but because it happens people we've barely introduced it carries no emotional or dramatic weight . if anything , it just made me think how much more herzog could made it all . moments work , most notably expulsion `naturals ' their land brief latter sequences england , but evidence 135-minute version i very much doubt malick promised longer cut solve problems . i know it meant work art , but i just came away feeling i'd watched old very average universal international 50s western redubbed first-year philosophy students . only surprise jeff chandler his bouncing basques didn't crop up .	-1

** spoiler alert ! ** time most people got theater see this film , or rented it , they already knew ship its crew would dead less than two hours . surprisingly , this not diminish film power . even second or third viewing , film never delivers moment false , maudlin , or sentimental . plot not what keeps people engaged during this film . it issue . how people face death ? this film , people captain crew boat . they know commercial fishing difficult dangerous job , even when weather good . weather not good . men need money . they go out even though they know they meet storm . they used risking their lives every day . storm turns into hurricane traps men , kills them . they struggle save their own lives . they fail . when they neck deep water compartment overturned boat , they face death squarely . they talk , briefly , unsentimentally , things they not able , people they miss . stark , plainness acting achieves powerful effect . beginning film , viewer meets crew . repeated viewings , film shows nothing milked -- nothing artificial . men solid , working people . there no sappy foreshadowing . director deserves kudos maintaining iron-fisted control vehicle could campy . viewer learn lot meteorology . special effects indistinguishable live action . all actors , including george clooney , maintain stoic engagement life , they struggle live , no appeal our pity , until they dead . perfect storm more than film . it parable . one could invest such classic work art	1
i've this workout many times i've come really enjoy it . it broken into 3 sections : 1 ) warmup , upper body , stretch 2 ) warmup , lower body , stretch 3 ) warmup , abs , stretch . some people upper body , lower body , abs three separate days , so individual warmup benefit them . but i like total body one day , so i found individual warmup each section unnecessary . i only first warmup . i'll either fast forward other two warmups or take time res t.t his workout definitely not firm tradition compound exercises , i.e. squats into shoulder presses or lunges into bicep curls . each exercise isolated , which my kind strength training style . upper body section goes quickly . pushups , lat rows , bent over rows , shoulder presses , side front lateral raises , french presses , tricep kickbacks , bicep curls end it . most unique exercise bicep curls sitting fanny lifter . you bring dumbbell up halfway , not all way up like traditional bicep curl . different refreshing . lower body tough - all those squats , lunges , step-ups fanny lifter . squats step-ups seemed endless because my thighs so tired , but least means workout effective . abs pretty good . crunches , obliques , bicycles , planks . what i really like how stephanie tells you either use light , medium , or heavy weights each exercise . " squat get heavy weights . " that great idea . i like guided way . stephanie instructor soft-spoken quiet . she not dynamic instructor , but doesn't mean she dull . she still cues well says reasurring things like " that tough , " which i find myself nodding agreement . everyone wears purple tops black bottoms . when i first this workout , i disappointed boring music . it wasn't exciting rocking like i expect modern video . it sounded more like background music . but it grown me , some exercises actually match music , especially during abs section . set all white . floor light colored hardwood or laminate flooring . it modern but unfortunately lacks character . not big deal though . long workout good , that all matters . overall , i really like this video . i like gym style doing one exercise time doing total body one video tape	1

akira kurosawa made rashomon 1950 , ikiru 1952 seven samurai 1954 . all these films quite complex structure . yet ikiru remains very simple film , which says nothing original : it not what shown , but how , important , flaubert story " simple heart " . it appreciated best those who've realised they're going die ( you'll know what i mean ) . watching ozu tokyo story beforehand prepare you subtle style . ikiru five themes interwoven : 1 . learning accept deathat start film kanji watanabe ( takashi shimura ) learns he stomach cancer six months live . he retreated into his work after his wife early death become devoted routine . camera shows us several shots closeup shimura face after he speaks his doctor , we see anguish his eyes . it not fear he shows : it horror , horror what his life become . shock his wife death caused him stop living . shock his own coming death makes him realise he must start live : only then he ready die . there contrast documentary style depiction hospital scenes watanabe office compared closeups shimura , hunched up horrified realisation or showing eyes black pools despair . this hardest thing any art form : this simplicity , effect overwhelming , acting superb . 2 . placing value your lifewatanabe not much expertise how live . his son mitsuo ( nobuo kaneko ) daughter-in-law kazue ( kyoko seki ) share his home but not much else . watanabe cannot speak them his cancer . cast out his own resources , watanabe tells complete stranger ( yunosuke ito ) what he could not tell his son . he asks his burning question , how i live ? two drunken men go sample what they imagine life : drinking shops , reviews , dance halls , strip clubs . this desperate living , way dying . watanabe brings whole thing halt when he requests pianist play old song , sings words , young girls who fall love how they should enjoy love life short . perhaps it favourite he his wife when they first met . melody haunting , watanabe theme several key points film . later watanabe sees toyo ( miki odagiri ) one his office colleagues . watanabe exhilarated her joyous love life , her enthusiasm , even her appetite . perhaps she teach him how live . she teaches him he cannot live proxy . watanabe finally discovers fulfillment doing good others using his position work . kurosawa opens out sets progressively . we see small rooms watanabe house , then cafe dance hall scenes night , then streets shops day , then finally offices , streets slums watanabe moves company government heads departments , yakuza trying extort money them , fellow bureaucrats , workmen slum dwellers his quest children park built . giving meaning your life within everyone scope , no matter how narrow scope may , enlarges it . there touch moralist here , but we liable forget it we watch shimura , small , fragile , bowed over pain , absolutely determined make others respond . they . 3 . dangers griefhow watanabe become man he ? his bedroom photo young , attractive woman , his wife . flashback sequence we see her funeral , learn she died unexpectedly when her son only five or six years old . beautiful vanished . this theme haunting overtones japanese culture . power , greatness , beauty transient teach us how live more deeply . but watanabe given dead woman his love now he cannot stop grieving . watanabe bedroom photo next his citation exemplary attendance work . funeral car watanabe watches hearse draws further away him : it distance he tried deny ever since . 4 . entropy inherent large structureswatanabe started his bureaucratic life ambitions reform . his idealistic report mouldering away bottom drawer . but he working place where only activity filling out reports , not achieving change . it kind tomb . here no one accept responsibility ; anything unusual , such request group neighborhood mothers swamp filled made into playground , frantically passed department . this not merely satire . government , country local region , behaving watanabe , withdrawing living substituting empty formalism its place . it no accident watanabe head department . if we want we ask , it my problem too ? moralist much more evidence here . 5 . political response we others ' actionsthat watanabe not entire subject film made clear his death occurs halfway through it . we see buddhist wake . guests wake first give lip service watanabe virtues , then politicians among them compete credit building park . workers watanabe department discuss who next head . group petitioners admitted pay their respects . they say nothing ; but they grateful . japan it matters how dead thought . kurosawa shows all survivors , even grief stricken , motivated personal considerations . he shows this natural inevitable , while satirising more extreme manifestations it . mourners cannot give meaning their life praising watanabe though ; they need strive hard watanabe : most them won't . there social dimension our actions , our inactions . kurosawa wants viewers his film wake too , reflect what watanabe life death meant . watanabe dies his playground . he sits swing , sings his song young girls who fall love . it snowing . watanabe happy , not because playground , not because song . he found something vital . what makes ikiru important film viewers who watch it understand just what he found	1

if you're fan vampires , werewolves , action , or gothic suspense , this probably movie you'd interested checking out . while it not groundbreaking film , it highly entertaining one , one , me , something i rewatch several times per year . filming very attractive . everything dark , yet not so dark you can't see what going . movie gothic look it - sets , costumes , lighting . ( please don't mistake meaning gothic terms entertainment same thing gothic lifestyle . ) music , mostly heavy rock , fits well movie . action sequences expertly shot exciting watch . movie uses several techniques made popular " matrix " , but who cares ? it works perfectly within this movie . only downfall movie complete lack humor ... there not single joke entire thing ! everything so serious dark unless you're pretty good mood movie could really bring you down ... that how heavy it . set . added scenes provide more insight , special features treat , especially 45-minute documentary " fang vs . fiction " , which talks vampires werewolves . it very intriguing . if you're fan this movie you own dvd already , i would recommend selling it buying this version , it worth money	1

clint eastwood 1985 western " pale rider " obvious combination two earlier westerns : " shane " 1953 eastwood own " high plains drifter " 1973 . " pale rider " , no doubt , homage these films rather than rip-off . story : mysterious drifter clerical collar rides into town angel mercy local miner settlers angel punishment their rich oppressor his men . difference " pale rider " " shane " " pale rider " much more modern take same basic story ; plus , unlike " shane , " " rider " possesses supernatural element . although " shane " definitely better film historical sense , " rider " more entertaining experience modern viewers . hence , " pale rider " better film . comparisons " high plains drifter , " " pale rider " much better picture . " drifter " slow , tedious vibe all characters unlikable ( but two ) . eastwood plays mean anti-hero who enacts revenge entire town three villains ; he only displays kindness two people . " drifter " he solely agent vengeance . this not case " pale rider . " eastwood character " rider , " known only ' preacher , ' equal parts mysterious , intriguing , heroic supernatural . other words , viewer both likes roots ' preacher . ' noted above , " pale rider " features one most memorable lines cinematic history . megan , almost-15-year-old girl , informs preacher she thinks she loves him . preacher coolly responds : " nothing wrong . if there more love world there'd lot less dying .

i thought george stevens ' impeccably crafted literate greatest story ever told ( 1965 ) finest life jesus christ film . then i took look recently director nicholas ray king kings ( 1961 ) changed my mind . i don't know what best life jesus , but king kings charismatic sympathetic christ ( jeffrey hunter performance his career ) , great john baptist ( robert ryan ) , definitive salome dance ( luscious brigid bazlen ) ultimate sermon mount ( 7,000 extras spanish hillside ) , striking last supper disciples sitting y-shaped bench , strong crucifixion , reverent resurrection . 171 minutes ( including ten minutes miklos rozsa music ) , samuel bronston production seems ideal length tell story christ . screenplay oscar winner philip yordan . i often trouble ron randell roman lucius ; he major character here only cameo other biblical epics . same harry guardino barabbas . they , actuality , second third most important characters ray film . but both actors magnificent . lucius lets us inside roman power circle understand roman way thinking , so it nice his role big . barabbas answers question lot viewers may ponder , namely who this convicted killer whom crowd chose live while jesus died . movie , narrated orson welles , starts story pompey judea 63 b.c. this helps give us information what judea like several decades before jesus born . among superb supporting cast siobhan mckenna mary , royal dano peter , hurd hatfield pontius pilate , viveca lindfors herod antipas ' mistress , frank thring herod antipas , many more . sets costumes gloriously colorful ; what academy thinking when they not nominated oscars 1961 , no cast mermbers or screenplay ? rozsa music glorious . movie presented dvd 2.2 ratio 70mm super technirama . king kings powerful , intelligent , colorful , reverent . i think jesus himself would impressed it .	1

" yet , it become certified cult classic isn't bad people build it up . true , it sick film through-and-through ... it seems like movie that trying depict how strong women , even though we watch women tortured raped not once , not twice , not three , but four f**king times . camille keaton ( grand-something buster ) plays jenny hill , writer who rents remote cabin country write novel . once there , four men take liking her ( one them retarded ) eventually they all rape her . this not one continuous scene four men each committing act , it four separate scenes . there first scene , then she crawls away , then it happens again , then she makes it her house , then it happens again . so so forth . movie only 100 minutes she doesn't begin her revenge trip until movie more than halfway through . usually " worst movies " ones where you tell someone entire plot it won't matter . true , if you're watching this film you know it woman who raped kills her four rapists . that truly all movie . when she commits last murder , movie ends . we , humans , fascinated macabre , disgusting , horrific . that why people watch movies like salo , pink flamingos , eraserhead , i spit your grave . yes , all these movies belong same category . although , theatrically , some those films listed better than others . say only sick people watch movies like this inaccurate watch films like this not wrong . yes , violence here exploited message it trying get across gets lost all blood , violence , castration occurs onscreen . " i spit your grave " not , definition , good film . it not film i want watch again , but horror film ( it horror film ) it pretty good . lots blood , lots violence , acting isn't half-bad , there lot skin ... you can't help but ( silently ) cheer keaton character when she gets her revenge men . " i spit your grave " not faint heart or conservative republican male , but if you read synopsis it it sounds interesting you . see it . grade :	-1

lady shanghi reputation secure classic film noir but then this genre notoriously disrespected probably because many film noirs based dime novels sound like it ; order appreciate film noir , therefore , you able enjoy kitschy quality snappy dime-novel dialogue . but kitsch alone not what makes ( some ) film noirs great . what really sets film noir apart other genres its striking , even elegant , visual style which often contrasts sharply its stark subject matter . film noir way glamourzing corruption , giving corruption unique aesthetic allure all its own . film noir probably owes something german expressionist film masters ( murnau , lang , von stroheim ) hollywood grotesques 20 30 but it absorbs evolves these influences into highly refined style its own . orson welles undisputed master high noir style . all his films after magnificent ambersons mobilize film noir methods techniques so welles ' reputation rises falls genre he not create but he perfected . film noir came age during wwii like many film noirs lady shanghai anxieties over race , class , sexuality , identity , this particular noir film , negotiating racial , social , cultural sexual difference increasingly globalized world . film takes place several international ( acapulco ) exotic ( chinatown ) settings these strange locales allow welles examine how his characters respond diverse array atmospheres social/cultural settings . welles himself plays central character film , michael o'hara , so he affects irish accent ( international touch ) , some critics argue , supposed sound false/inauthentic . o'hara way talking sounds bit too self-consciously literary ; though he affects working class worldliness his yarns sound like they come straight out conrad ( o'hara echoes many conrad colonial concerns ) hemingway ( o'hara echoes hemingway anti-franco sentiments ) so we suspect this character spent more time reading writing stories than actually working . whether we believe michael irish brogue authentic or not we know he fond creating fictions this casts suspicions his identity well his version events we hear voiceover . furthermore , we see his obsession literature given him taste romantic typically masculine posturing his favorite literary heroes instead making him worldly wise this just makes him all more gullible when pretty lady promise new adventure come . elsa ( played welles ' then-wife rita hayworth)identifies michael easy mark first time they meet . unlike michael elsa actually worldly we tell she seen experienced lot she knows lot world ( not just read lot it ) she sees through michael pseudo-brogue bravura right away knows exactly how exploit his romantic tendencies . she sums him up plays him first moment they exchange knowing glances ( hers much more knowing than his ) . michael prides himself his independence his integrity but he just can't help falling elsa pretend innocence helplessness -- its just too good resist -- he can't help wanting come charging her rescue even though there signs everywhere indicate elsa no need rescuing . first michael resists her job offer but she woman who always gets her way soon michael one her employee/servants just like all other men film . michael just can't tear himself away elsa dangerously seductive corruptive charms he willingly perhaps willfully misinterprets innocence helplessness only because version her makes him feel better his own true motives . michael hired extra hand elsa husband yacht soon he steps foot deck everyone else aboard sizes him up begins figuring how they use him further their own plots . elsa husband bannister famous lawyer both he his partner grisby , like michael , under elsa spell trying plot their way out captivity . yacht pulls out harbor we see word " circe " written bold letters yacht hull . elsa past secret only hinted ( all we know she born island somewhere east spent some time shanghai ) . she looks like penultimate american blonde but she not america her cultural reference points decidely eastern contrast michael western points reference ; michael she represents unknown perhaps unkowable , this part her allure also what makes her so dangerous . " elsa " prototypical femme fatale conventions film noir genre tell us things not end well anyone gets too close but she just too enticing . most famous scene film elsa sleek black bathing suit diving off some perilous rocks if she accustomed such danger if danger her natural element . but then she lays down sunbathe rocks relative safety boat michael looking , anxiously aware how dangerous she , allow himself comforting illusion she vulnerable she needs saving only he save her not only all other male predators board , but save her her own eastern imbued fatalistism . elsa so beautiful she all men film believing exactly what she wants them believe all them believing they've actually got chance her . men all slowly lose their head around her . some men talk down her but still they what she says she all them plotting against each other while lighting her cigarettes . film criticized impossibly tangled plot but i think point film you never supposed certain or not whether elsa merely defending herself against men who want control her or if elsa control all them ( just like she control michael ) start . even end we still want believe elsa victim something , perhaps something her past she just can't escape , but since we don't know what her past we no ultimate insight into what driving her all nor matter we any insight into what originary crime or sin driving men all ; all we know sexes races classes odds . elsa remains unknown all way through michael once ensnared must realize he too unknown because under her influence he forced act against what he perceived his own true nature . lady shanghai offers some most stunning visuals any film noir i know . acapulco scenes especially exciting danger unpredictability foreign woman made especially inviting exciting foreign land . this film welles offers ultimate noir vision anxiously uncertain men women attracted each other but also repelled what they find themselves attracted what they find themselves doing name desire . its film noir means film follows certain recognizable conventions but it more than simply follow those conventions , it pushes those conventions far they pushed explores nature those conventions more thorough way than any noir before or , arguably , since . end film characters become lost their own plots no longer know who they this conveyed brilliantly welles use masks mirrors celebrated luridly twisted funhouse scene which feels bit like famous dali sequence hitchcock spellbound but even more disorienting disconcerting ( spellbound released 1945 so it possible , even likely , welles seen it it influenced his own film made 1946 released 1948 ) . [ extra featurette follows film we learn welles himself painted much funhouse props set . ] there lot bad noirs out there these give genre bad name but few good ones among best films ever made . welles ' reputation would greater if film noir better understood appreciated not genre cheap dime novels inspired it but genre where cinema explores its own methods techniques . great directors lang von stroheim welles hitchcock godard chabrol other new wave auteurs all attracted noir this reason . brilliant film . after this film ( which commerical flop ) welles didn't work america ten years when he return america he made touch evil ( brilliant noir film ) . touch evil also failed generate revenue effectively ended welles career mainstream director even though he continued make independently financed small pictures like othello , macbeth , trial chimes midnight .	1

" innocent voices " one those films simply blows you away its incredibly moving story , great acting , directing , cinematography . i privilege seeing this film talk cinema , where you see films theaters saturday or sunday morning weeks or months before they released -- so there no reviews hinder your pure enjoyment film . we walk into movie theater no idea what we're going see morning . 400 film fans theater sunny september 2005 morning no idea what expect this " innocent voices " film which , sadly , got virtually no theatrical distribution chicagoland . i'll not repeat summary film others posted here . it film impact reflects so well power this medium . after closing credits ran , there total silence auditorium , broken only soft sound sobbing all around . then you realized you among those tears . i haven't seen such reaction film since " shindler list .

this one my all-time favorites movie made me fall adoration myrna loy . thin man first " oldie " flick i saw 10 year old , although sophisticated innuendos went over my head then , it still ingrained me love preference old movies hollywood golden age . much talk already said detailing stars ' chemistry plot itself . but i still wanted show my support this classic so i thought i'd contribute some hopefully interesting facts trivia re thin man . this second pairing william powell myrna loy , first manhattan melodrama ( 1934 ) . but t'was thin man cemented their star status hollywood . wonderful rapport two selling point movie ( sorry , dashiell hammett ) , rendering mystery plot secondary importance ( something missing , possibly murdered inventor ) . myrna loy 80 films , silent sound , mostly playing " other women " exotic vamps , before thin man came her way . mgm reluctant co-star myrna loy thin man , feeling myrna wasn't right role . also , time constraints played part studio plans star her stamboul quest , which begins filming 3 weeks . director woody " one-take " van dyke threatened walk out mgm relented but one condition : thin man completed under 3 weeks . van dyke finished 16 days . myrna played her last exotic role stamboul quest never looked back . thin man offered two unprecedented elements . firstly , film played up folks fun murder second , two leads portrayed wisecracking , happily wedded couple who witty , refined relished married . movies back then would normally their couples getting out marriage or ending up married finale . no one before actually explored realm hip happily wedded husband wife body film . mgm executives very nervous first preview film , unsure movie reception . but they needn't worried . van dyke knew what he wanted . he instructed albert hackett frances goodrich , husband-and-wife screenwriters , focus nick nora relationship pay lesser attention murder mystery . thin man series proven training ground young , up-and-coming actors . after thin man ( 1936 ) co-stars jimmy stewart , oozing his soon-to-be-patented aw-shucks sincerity , while shadow thin man ( 1941 ) features lovely , wholesome donna reed co-starring role . this first thin man , course , showcases gamine maureen o'sullivan . myrna loy recalled cast never allowed make friends various wire-haired terriers who played asta , it might distract thespian dogs . thin man doesn't refer nick charles but lanky , cranky inventor murder victim clyde wynan t.t here 72-episode thin man television series ( 1957-59 ) starring peter lawford phyllis kirk . before william powell immortalized nick charles , he played gentleman detective philo vance canary murder case ( 1929 ) , greene murder case ( 1929 ) , benson murder case ( 1930 ) kennel murder case ( 1933 ) . novel thin man dashiell hammett excellent short mystery novel . while not witty funny movie , it still very good read . unfortunately , unlike movie version , book never spawned sequel .	1
i loved " children corn " ! it wasn't scary , but characters especially intimidating . it also comes little bits both humor pity . example , humor mistakes made making . i could point out 5 first time i saw it ! there not much humor script . sad parts movie course when some people die . it sad when all parents adults die , because without them innocent children helpless . you can't help but feel little sorry isaac when he devoured " he who walks behind rows " , even though isaac bad guy . i would reccomend this movie someone who really nothing friday night wants evil kid action doesn't mind corny special effects . not put time off your schedule just watch this movie . it good movie only when it should , that when you hour half free time . also , don't see sequals ; they're absolutely , undeniably , stunningly terrible !!! you could probably watch them if you desperatly bored out your mind . anyway , first one best . besides some gorey parts , saddening child adult deaths , hokey movie resolution , this movie beatiful story mainly loving couple who meet two kids while driving throgh nebraska	-1

written fellow who gave world " monkeybone " ( sam hamm ) directed gentleman responsible " loony tunes : back action " ( joe dante ... okay , okay , he also " gremlins " ) , " homecoming " yet " masters horror " misfire . this time around , story concerns world where right-wing political pundits inadvertantly cause dead american soldiers come back life . david murch ( jon tenney ) jane cleaver ( thea gill doing her best anne coulter imitation ) offer up typical republican soundbites defense ( tactfully unnamed ) president ill-advised war iraq . one those soundbites ?

" homecoming " vendetta , that all it . i'm all exposing corruption deceit , but even if there those who agree this film message ( many , many ) , i fail see how those same people also agree film self-righteous moralizing , its hate , its presumption . after all , this little " screw you " current administration props up its high horse idea conservatives only promoting their own selfish agendas claiming speak america fallen men women . but " homecoming " guilty exact same offense . last frame , it obvious no one show aware self-defeating irony their proselytizing , which really only horrific thing this turkey	-1

i'm werewolf nut horror movie fan , but what really makes this movie characters their interactions . ginger bridgette very compelling poigiant . there few cliches , like hightened sexuality wolves experience . i didn't really like part it because it just too traditional but rest it wonderful . whole thing very unsettling stays you . how they deal gradual transformation interesting becasue she doesn't just start turning into violent sexual beast , if anything alters but enhances ginger personality . i highly recommend it	1
" antwone fisher " powerful moving film . i seen this film numerous time especially hbo it very true life . i imagine actual process antwone risking finding his " roots " coming terms his birth family based more than three psych sessions . there much said good psychotherapy . more african american women men suffer untold anguish keeping harsh realities life themselves under misconception " strong ! " while suffering illnesses mind . oscar winner , denzel washington impressive job his directorial debut . there many scenes which i enjoyed watching . they included beginning ( dreams little boy - check out gigantic-sized pancakes ! ) ending ( dreams turned into reality ) , which beautifully tied story together . addition directorial responsibilities , mr. washington continues show why he won oscar award successful all his acting roles . he strong presence this movie . all actors represented their parts well . actor , derek luke demonstrated why he so right part antwone fisher . he portrayed very real hear t-t ugging work . joy bryant who played part cheryl , antwone love interest , resembled ray sunshine screen . chemistry flowed well romantic characters . my favorite scene happened when young man finally confronted his mother her reaction towards him . priceless . novella nelson who played part mrs. tate , despicable character , deserves special mention . although we only see her few minutes , actress who played fisher mother gave outstanding performance . antwone fisher shouldn't overlooked , highly recommended my list .	-1

" conversation " little seen masterpiece francis ford coppola , made " godfather " " godfather pt . ii . " it mystery-drama , plays like horror movie similar nicolas roeg film " don't look now " sense works dread , rather than fright . two-time academy award winner gene hackman plays harry caul , wiretapper whom we first meet he recording conversation young couple park . caul sees his job job , he doesn't get involved people he records nor he pay much attention details conversation . he supposed record it deliver it . his suspicions begin grow tape when he tries personally deliver it mysterious person who asked it instead badgered man assistant ( harrison ford ) it . same time we begin realize how bad caul his job . his partner stanley ( john cazale ) quit already began working wiretapper . superintendent his apartment building managed get inside his multi-locked apartment drop off birthday present . ladyfriend his tells harry time she watched his spying someone hour ... it no wonder when rival wiretapper comes his office him he manages record intimant conversation harry woman . while mystery revolving around " conversation " continues , harry begins deciphering some sentences his suspicions confirmed when he hears sentence : " he'd kill us if he got chance ? " this question fuels rest movie , until very creepy superb climax . some most haunting parts film come end this due visuals film . one much-talked scene comes when harry flushes toilet motel room it begins overflowing blood . this scene ( few follow it ) some most effectively creepy scenes i've seen long time . gene hackman superb harry caul , multi-layered character page must seemed very one-dimensional . harry man no personal life , almost no friends , he man lives shrouded mystery . coppola already proved time this movie came out he cinematic genius , but he mostly known movies like " godfather " " apocalypse now . " those films 3 hour long epic films , but i think really see how much range coppola director it nice take look " conversation . " few people seen this movie , it much smaller scale film most his movies but it truly masterwork . great acting , great direction , great art direction , great cinematography . grade :	1
wow this bring back memories ! this probabely one movie i most obessed little kid . i watched it constantly acted it out my own my little pony toys . i bet my dad looks this movie dread now because i can't even count times i made him sit thru it play it out me ! he probabely still remebers each line heart ! " snooz coming ! snooz coming ! " silly .. sadly when i tried showing it children i babysit , they not too impressed . i suppose it only good children who grew up it toys because children i showed it simply not care seeing characters or even recognized them . seeing your favourite toy movie must its appeal when it first released 1980s . doesn't mean those kids i showed it didn't enjoy it completely though . they liked parts those 2 bratty witches , wanted see my old my little pony collection . i suppose it simply going one those movies only good during certain time . but what you expect ? it one those movies born out popular toyline . my little ponies making comeback now ( this time around they look cute , unlike their last comeback 1997-1999 ) , so this movie may interest those fans well . but those who don't like toys , it probabely won't . hence why i only gave it 4 stars	-1
i absolutely love golden girls . i watched it over over still get laugh kick out it . my family always saying " oh god , you not watching them again ! " australia we don't get releases old shows quickly you , we only up season 3 , so i wrapt when amazon released nearly whole series . it brilliant	1
i owned wild orchid quite few years beginning thought it bit out there . some it doesn't fit , some it doesn't make sense some it just plain dumb . reason i gave it 4 stars because i like mickey rourke . even though he look bit beat up this movie kind scary looking first slicked down hair he practically oozing sex . carre otis character , emily , seems bit aloof childlike . she bombarded scenes people sex abandoned building , watching 2 people sex limo . wheeler ( mickey rourke ) almost seems enjoy watching emily squirm bit . wheeler sort detached , but wanting someone he trust . its tough make sense this movie because honestly best part end . now i unrated version so it shows more than r-rating ( movie like this one - unrated or nc-17 way go)-the part where wheeler emily make love finally . it very arousing say least . i must give it zalman king . he knows how far go where movie gets into your mind , but yet he doesn't go gratuitous sex . i suggest delta venus , which zalman king experience	-1

one most impressive things criterion dvd label its willingness select offbeat challenging titles . film inclusion criterion collection , fact , almost guarantees it seen more diverse group viewers than might originally sought dvd out . this good thing , or bad thing , ( but usually good ) especially titles really only appeal specific target audience . such case experimental documentary " symbiopsychotaxiplasm . " i think individuals fascinated creative art filmmaking intrigued entertained -- specifically film students , scholars , theorists , documentarians , like . casual viewers , however , film appeal may somewhat limited -- so i recommend you know what you're getting into before you purchase this dvd . dvd set contains two films --" symbiopsychotaxiplasm : take one " " symbiopsychotaxiplasm : take 2 1/2 . " " take one , " shot 1968 , director william greaves takes full film crew new york central park . there he films various actors tackling fairly provocative script sex relationships . scenes depicted , over over , reminiscent second rate tennessee williams ' script their melodrama psychosexual dialogue . employing different cameras , he not only films actors , but himself , members crew , patrons park ( specifically those he feels represent some aspect what enacted ) . it chaotic set where no one really knows what going -- but it fascinating look process action . crew know greaves trying all-encompassing documentary , but differing opinions its intent or what form it should take . without greave knowledge , then , they start rebel -- filming meetings themselves debating merits theory behind greave vision ( or lack thereof ) . it messy look people who passionate film trying make sense what they doing . " take 2 1/2 , " we pick up much same way . first 40 minutes captures more footage shoot " take one . " second half , however , shows film finally released film festival -- 35 years later ! now participants who reunited still trying articulate significance " symbiopsychotaxiplasm . " greaves calls it metaphor vietnam , but no one else who involved make connection . after festival , greaves crew ( steve buscemi ) set out recreate experience . crew , knowledge project previous film , fail generate much passion or drama--they're just doing their jobs . what we get , however , extended sequence two actors really going improv get heart their characterizations . it might one most evocative depictions real actors working their craft i've ever seen . i know i've probably too descriptive ( or not enough , i don't even know) -- but films truly difficult describe . if you like film process ( or acting process ) watching it detail , this might useful film . if you like see or participate debate meaning film other aspects film theory , this film might stimulate your intellect . film also stands interesting , but not overt , look racism , sexism some other societal mores inherent sixties artistic community . i actually enjoyed these films , but recognize they not everyone . this experimental film no beginning or end , no major revelations or commentaries . everyone likely take something different out viewing experience -- so i'll leave you . kgharris , 02/07 .	-1

playtime depicts monsieur hulot day city . hulot ( jacques tati ) spends his day trying make appointment city , which takes place busy downtown paris very modern building wide windows , work cubicles , robot-like secretaries resembling flight attendants . hulot not quite meet his contact , his experience like cat mouse game . addition , through out film he comes across group stereotypical american tourists who hop off bus their cameras hand capture parisian landscape well natives city . indeed , playtime comedy absurd falls lines chaplinesque film meets warner brother cartoon . film quite humorous unusual . hulot seldom speaks clear language , but rather mumbles or grunts incomprehensible ; one watches , there no need subtitles because tati emphasizes characters ' actions rather than what they say . his trenchcoat , hat , pipe , umbrella , hulot carries charlie chaplin buster keaton tradition -- misfit-like character who happens go his business , but somewhere way , mayhem ensues . all day , hulot roams building , rides bus , end day , he ends up new nightclub full chaos funny business , which may resemble something out marx brothers film . playtime may depict hulot entire day . however , it obvious jacques tati , who also directed film , may attempting make social commentary state france during 1960s . particular , paris its relations western world -- united states . this modern paris always known place fun romance rather than consumerism or commercialism . however , playtime shows ever-changing paris its physical architecture romance world market . tourists visit super store , hulot ventures consumer-like convention where vendors promoting their wares . one brief significant scene film shows reflection eiffel tower window , later same window shows us capitol building . viewers watch film , one may observe hulot character part landscape , somewhat fixture imagination . nevertheless , playtime full humor , may interest viewers who like charlie chaplin or buster keaton type films little french twist .	1

koyaanisqatsi great , unique piece cinema , but look visually socially little dated these days . phillip glass soundtrack works beautifully time lapse scenes but after while begins grate ... powaqatsi based much more ryhthms life work developing world , but opposed koyaanisqatsi hectic time-lapse , it so slow-mo meditative some viewers may find it perfect thing fall asleep too . godfrey reggio original vision seems fluke - cinematographer ron fricke made koyaanisqatsi good it , but upon seeing how depressing it , he then made baraka improve it . third instalment series , naqyqatsi , best avoided or borrowed video library watched fast forward	-1
okay , i'll agree critics " tinker , tailor .

this very entertaining dvd , full action very well constructed filmed battle scenes great scope . some ways film very timely considering there tension current western civilization america europe islamic world stretches across asia . i found it interesting film depicts those christians who tolerant multicultural diverse nation those christians not tolerant other religious beliefs . this film , balian ( played orlando bloom ) , his father , king jerusalem ( pitiful leper hiding behind silver mask ) represent those forces live diversity spiritual beliefs . templar knights represent those forces not live diversity multiculturalism it threatens them . this film , muslims powerful military force also diverse tolerance or non-tolerance christians . it beautiful film , fascinating architecture , set construction , weapon costume design . battle city jerusalem exciting , dramatic high point , critical aspect film . saladin wins battle jerusalem handed over muslims . remember after death jesus , apostles disciples spread christianity into egypt ethiopia , into rome , france , spain , england , ireland . also christianity spread into eastern europe such romania , hungary , germany . christianity spread into present day syria , jordan , iraq , iran . thus sweep islam across world around year 600 brought islam christian communities cities across middle east . it response this growing islamic power dominance over middle east 700 years crusades waged - which primary theme film . yet this not christians hate muslims who turn hate christians type film . instead writers film-makers imply kingdom heaven attainable here earth through belief tolerance other beliefs god . this actually good message our day time - which director ridley scott obviously knows	-1

i heard it said many times no addiction starts out physical dependancy ; addiction really begins psycological/spiritual defect deep down inside . i think way movie beginning showed insecurity unease two main characters most underrated aspect this brilliant film . alcohol washes away unease pain awhile , but when mask wears off , literally , all hell breaks loose !! some commented jack lemmon greenhouse scene subsequent mental-ward scene not realistic . i disagree this , i think his character mental state such complete breakdown very real possibility point story . ultimately , this film more than just story dangers alcoholism . it story dangers low self-esteem not loving yourself . true breeding ground addiction , i don't know if there ever film more effective job illustrating this !! absolute classic ... one ages !!	1

i really enjoyed this film . factory fan , i hesitant get this , perhaps due off-putting title . but i'm glad i . acting great , especially actor who played warhol himself - dead . also , ms. taylor 100% believable unfortunate , demented , freaky valarie solanas . i notice lot negative reviews this other films consist rant film worst they ever saw , waste 2 hours , etc ., but these folks never explain why they didn't like it . this true some bad reviews here . additionally , i'm not sure filmmaker harron not taking blantant stance against scum manifesto constitutes endorsment it ; rather opposite . it seems me solanas ' rants so out there crazy it isn't necessary say " hey , this wrong/bad/whatever .

anjelica huston , julianna marguelies joan allen bring life fabulous tale marion zimmer bradley . sterling performances engaging tale keep you glued your seats thorugh this seemingly short three hour saga . those who trouble book , this movie presents it well . while not completely true current arthurian research , tale captivating , presents window into world where struggle paganism christianity might taken place . facts show arthur merlin might much more christian oriented than mists avalon depict , but one imagine this struggle occur sometime , who , how when questions only answered imagination	1
singin rain arguably best movie musical all time , not just because music but because entire package - premise , comedy , characters - everything here works together make you feel better any time you sit down watch it . it ironic this movie thrown together quickly capitalize success " american paris " , since improvisational feeling movie one things makes it so much fun . although this film number ten top 100 films all time compiled american film institute , it wasn't nominated best picture year its release , 1952 . although it well box office , it would over twenty years before people would look back realize just what great motion picture it . perhaps because 1970 such bleak cynical years , movies largely matched mood , people eager rediscover fun motion picture viewing experience could . movie focuses period time which entire motion picture film industry nervous transition silent talking pictures . although movie compresses time this respect - transition actually took three years - it accurately describe technical problems era their comical aspects . there overabundance musicals first batch talking films , many stars heavy accents made their speech undecipherable or voices came across like nails chalkboard like lina lamont ( jean hagen ) saw their careers ruined , early sound technology itself so fragile you would often see actors speaking potted plants or coat racks comic effect . preview silent picture team lockwood lamont first talkie , " dueling cavalier " , one most hilarious scenes film . it pretty typical what you would see such early talking picture - dialogue going out sync , actors actresses strutting around wildly gesturing if nobody hear them , dialogue still resembled what you would read off title cards silent film - " i love you , i love you , i love you " . all this one reasons singin ' rain never get dated - it comic nostalgic look very narrow period time . this movie fun outside its comic take movie history , though . one , it hard say who steals show most , since there so many thieves involved . most notably there jean hagen - who actually very acceptable speaking voice - evil silent star who can't accept her days numbered . then there 27 year-old donald o'connor cosmo , studio music director sidekick gene kelly character whose youthful exuberance really shines number " make ' em laugh " all his goofy facial expressions . he seems much fun audience . finally , there all great dance numbers music , capped probably one most famous scenes all time - gene kelly rendition title number perfectly captures joy man who just fallen love feels he world his feet . you just can't watch this film not come away smile your face . it good soul chicken soup , just lot more fun .	1
this very good movie . great actors very good ending .	1
when i first saw this film 1982 , it reminded me one david lean epics . like lawrence arabia or dr. zhivago , it tells story nations political movements perspective single person . cast top notch , acting superb ( ben kingsley amazing this role ) , photography gorgeous . so it must-see film , but what dvd ? word , terrific ! sound color all look wonderful , extra features informative . i cannot say how this dvd edition compares one came out five years ago , but if you don't already own dvd copy this film , you won't disappointed this one	1
if you ho fan , you love this . great songs , great interviews boys daryl winter home . you get see how they really behind scenes . they love their music their fans .	1
excellent , especially considering humble production film . it refreshing people still making these kinds movies , but it shame they few far . it likely labled " corny " or " preachy " mainstream crowd , but i hope people give it chance really latch real meaning this film presents .	1
elvis fans should get this movie just song -girl i never loved- it song you not hear elsewhere	1
so much fun watching these old movies . i'm very happy this purchase . some first movies i viewed poor sound quality , but i could still understand what said . also , i didn't notice logo played someone mentioned . both sides play perfectly . i would definately recommend buying this movie pack if you love these type movies . ( meant give 5 star rating , gave 4 mistake )	-1
i enjoy this too . we could not wait own this . he almost all old doctors series . now we new one . what great way pass eveing when tv stinks .	1
i'm fan miike , but _izo_ just too much . there no plot whatsoever , just poor unfortunate reincarted samurai wandering through time space killing everyone who crosses his path . that it ! end sentence ! if you think you stand over two hours this , give it try . if you're looking something even rudimentary plot , you might want try something else , like _audition_ or _ichi killer_ . i'd rather watch incomprehensible _gozu_ again than forced sit through _izo_ . it beautifully-photographed , but ultimately pointless film . maybe 6th or 7th other film miike directs this year more interesting	-1
this foreign film cuba . it story developing friendship gay man diego who enjoys finer things life young communist student . first student david repelled diego manipulated go diego apartment . slowly , david becomes diego buddy he explores new ways looking life . diego neighbor nancy gets romantically involved david . truthfully , this movie bored me . i don't care if it got nominated academy award best picture .	-1
we become world almost obsessed appearances . we lead believe if we look or dress certain way then we accepted who we . we all told " beauty only skin deep " but how many us really believe this way ? how many times you seen overly obese person grocery store cheetos pastries beer their cart thought yourself , " good job , tubby , keep it goin ' ... " i mean , i'm not putting myself up some golden pedastel , because i often made many judgments others simply because way they looked which kind makes me sad admitting this because i often judged way i looked growing up i totally resented those people who said stuff stuff just humiliate me try make me feel bad myself . no , i wasn't obese , but i very skinny . i stood 6'1 " weighed 105-106 whopping 107 if i didn't take dump day . you probably imagine ridicule i went through day day out . out frustration anger humiliation , i ended up working out . now you might say others ridiculing me turned out very positive experience . not positive you might think . i found these same people ridiculed me couple years before now wanted chummy me now i buffed incredibly good looking ... okay ... maybe i just buffed , but even though i appearance someone who strong confident , inside i still this insecure skinny kid who used run home school tears his eyes wondering why people didn't just like me who i . this movie really hit home both my wife myself because even though she grew up east coast i grew up west coast , our stories remarkably similar even though hers opposite . my wife incredibly beautiful woman inside well outside , but she weight " challenge " she still one . she very careful what she eats make sure she gets her exercise or pounds come back . but i love her her . she not her weight . she human deserves love , appreciation , respect . you might think this film hokey , it not terribly funny , but message very clear . look beyond what outer into inner soul person . there very touching scene i would like attempt describe before i go . hal ( jack black ) goes into hospital rosie ( gwyneth paltrow ) volunteer work . he under " spell " rosie most gorgeous woman he ever met he meets this little girl . he sees little girl tells her she prettiest little girl he ever met . she , very pretty little girl . after spell broken , he goes back into same hospital little girl goes , " hal ! hal ! don't you remember me ? " it same little girl but this time he sees her burn victim he witnesses all scars all over her body , " you told me i prettiest girl you'd ever seen ... " he holds her his arms , " you're right , princess , you ... you ... " under " spell " hal saw right through people into their heart ... their spirit ... their soul ... hal saw people they really . now you might think that load sentimental mush it this movie geared toward mushy side , but it really very important message we need hear over over again ; we not packaging ... we what inside ... even obvious sentimentality going this film , i some genuine belly ( no pun intended ) laughs goin ' . there scene where hal smears vaseline all over his eyes tells rosie , " uhhh ... i contagious conjunctivitis ... but i'll okay ... " i don't know why i thought so funny , but if there one thing jack black knows how very dry very understated . he actually very good choice this part . even when he " " , his humor very subtle just creeps up you you think back go , " wow ... funny ... " this movie same way . i found myself thinking certain parts just laughing . it good film it great message even though we all heard , " beauty eye beholder " million times our lives , we really need start acting though it truth , because it . it our light within makes us truly shine brightly . peace blessing	-1
i love michael wood . his wonderful legacy series his books also , he puts friendly arm around viewer/reader takes him/her voyage old places which he makes new his up-close show-and-tell-style . jove , i never knew so many shakespeare haunts still standing , nor i ever so immersed traditions still going strong shakespeare times . . . takes us inside dozens town halls , old manors castles very spots where bard first performed boy , applied wedding license , played queen , etc . placing shakespeare squarely his dangerous times showing us political religious plots swirled around him , shakespeare became beautifully real me . m.w. shows us shakespeare writing may all times but bard very much product his times . beautifully photographed , also , oh yes , anglophiles love all neat old places . thanks michael	1
i am quite new pilates though i've doing yoga daily past nine years . i'm finding pilates nice addition yoga it really works your body different but complementary way . i recently bought four dvd disc set stott i've " basics " previously this " flat ab " dvd today found them both excellent ! it bit long side , around 50 minutes , so it not quickie sort deal . it incredibly well chaptered , fact every exercise chaptered so you exercises you want if you don't feel like doing whole thing ( but warm ups really important before jumping into other exercises ) . i definitely aware my core during after doing this program , it definitely delivers it promise ! course if you overweight you need eat healthy lose weight order truly get flat abs , no amount exercise give you if you don't combine it good nutrition ( this something i've learned experience ) . however , you strengthen your core doing this program ! referring previous review this program , i didn't find it overly slow moving all , rather it paced way flowed but challenging . personally i don't like it when programs forcibly rushed sake saving time . i'd rather part program like this her pacing than rush through practice tries squeeze everything too quickly sacrifice good instruction form . there other programs out there shorter practices may appropriate someone who time conscious but what i've seen they just fewer exercises which grouped according body part you want focus rather than rushing through too many exercises while sacrificing form . anyway , i am very impressed this other stott program i've worked so far i'm looking forward trying other programs set	1
forget fiction you've seen . men this film real deal . this graphic documentary first-rate . you meet these special ops characters up close personal . you go these guys follow their story streets iraq deserts afghanistan their secret headquarters . what particularly great they often far what you'd expect . but it makes you feel better know they're there . this film also traces history special forces . if i one complaint , i would liked seen more interviews individual troops . but overall this film delivers big time	1
after reading sven nykvist just died i decided look fanny alexander again after 23 years . he cinematographer this film very interested capturing light darkness . this film quarter century old . our digital ideas film cinematography certainly changed well our morals . i just so carried away wonderful story delightfully unconventional , today standards , disfunctional family philanderers contrasted extrodinarily harsh fundamentalist protestant family contrasted family almost magical jews . i don't believe this film could remade today it pity our moral culture changed so .	1
this film version tale two cities masterpiece -- it faithful adapts dickens ' classic novel while holding out worthwhile movie its own right through incredible performances its lead actors . plot novel not touched -- filming dickens ' most tightly-plotted novel , good decision . acting uncommonly good . sydney carton fabulously ; james wilby commended wonderful nuanced performance . i also found madame defarge particularly well-done ; actress playing her scary ! considering mme . defarge character book , i think her almost insane bitterness sharp purpose well-portrayed . couple unique things this film include its use french actors play french characters british actors play british characters . no contrived accents , people actually look their nationality -- both important such highly political story . i also strongly support decision carton darnay played different people ; yes , they're supposed look alike , but not identical . different actors play them facilitates portrayal their very contrasted characters . i am admittedly coming perspective one who read loved book years before seeing movie ; i can't judge what this film would like someone who never read novel . but i found it accurate sensitive adaptation book i know love , i imagine beauty story would appeal just easily someone experiencing story first time	1

so much tallent , it difficult tell who end up stealing show . they just don't make movies like this anymore . although van johnson sing , dance act , he comes off me sort heel , especially way he treats louise , who love him . my favorite part dinner when judy garland sings " barbershop chord " quartet . just when it seems it can't get any better , judy rips roof off her version " i don't care " . buster keaton who given very few lines speak just steals show when he masterfully demolishes his uncle violin . i saw this picture when it came out 1949 , watched it many times afterwards . each time i see something i didn't see before . its simply wonderful !	1

john ford filmmaker who much praised many derided good many others . chief criticism seems lie his treatment indians sterotypical inferiors , prone same type predictable behaviour film after film . most strange , ford always used white man chief indian his films . i tend find this criticism accurate . i also find certain his westerns lack gritty realism , say , peckingpah work , border preposterous . ford use exterior settings , however , peerless , rock monolith bordering his town tombstone " my darling clementine " ( 1943 ) awe inspiring . i wouldn't rate ford top ten , but i'd rank this film among great westerns considered american classic . course , this telling " shootout ok corral " earps ( henry fonda , ward bond ) doc holliday ( victor mature ) versus clantons ( walter brennan ) . some reason , westerns fonda quieter resonance than most i really like this . i give john ford credit this one . it filled many fine , small details - acting seems more subdued , even little melancholy - yet he uses vast space arizona desert only ford , without peer . use title song played qiuetly background , , even better , hummed time time henry fonda . fonda different wyatt earp than ones we've seen fairly recently " tombstone " ( 1993 ) " wyatt earp " ( 1994 ) , less violent , more gentleman , , film progresses , somewhat shy admirer doc holliday old girl friend ( clementine , course ) back east . fonda played " ox-bow incident " " clementine " within one year time period , , though he primary character these two films , he also blended adroitly lot other very good actors actresses . tip hat him well ford . i don't believe ford version earp saga very accurate , but , when movie this well , who cares ? final scene memorable its downcast last meeting wyatt clementine , when they finally express little their feelings each other , fonda kisses her cheek , then rides off , dissolving into immensity arizona landscape . almost bought tear my eye . john ford directed many good great films inspite above reservations , but this john ford his absolute best	1

when i first saw first x-men movie i highly impressed special effects , but plot nearly bored me tears . but i can't say x2 : x-men united . this outing , there several good plots here , all them leading spectacular action scenes . chief among these william stryker ( advisor president ) his plan kill off all mutants : first initiating attempt president life more than it seems first , then using knowledge he gains magneto , who imprisoned his all plastic cage since end first movie . once he knows all cerebro , professor xavier special computer locating mutants , he then captures professor forces him attempt kill all mutants . plot involves wolverine attempt learn his past stryker . trying learn his past , wolverine encounters vicious female version himself equipped his own powers regeneration claws boot . his battle her not missed . there yet plot where magneto attempts turn stryker plan around kill all humans instead mutants . all these elements more fit beautifully together this film where we introduced new characters like nightcrawler pyro , we see loss (?) one core x-men characters . this much better movie than it predecessor -- 135 minute , nearly two half hours -- it much longer movie , too , but one that well worth watching . it would nice if few lose ends tied up , but i guess then there wouldn't anything sequel you just feel coming .	1

probably most over-looked trois couleurs trilogy , principally because it one middle different tone bleu rouge , trois coleurs blanc bleak comedy inequality troublesome relationships . karol karol , played sublime bemusement zbigniew zamachowski , serious trouble his soon-to-be ex-wife dominique ( ice-maidenly julie delpy ) . she his bank account frozen , left him nothing . so karol goes back his homeland poland begins plot fiendish revenge . three colours white probably more common kiewslowski tv series morality plays , dekalog [ worth your attention ! ] than it other two films series . it less stylised , filmed straightforward , almost documentary style it - like couple those dekalog shorts - grim , dark comedy ethics . kieslowski always maintained he no great moralist . he didn't claim any answers way people lived their lives ; he just found subject interesting liked ask questions himself his audiences . this , part , what gives his films their deep humanity . white bursting humanism . decision film it more straightforward style apparently came because kieslowski acknowledge colour white most difficult film , so notion building symbolic colour-scheme around it ( he blue red other two films ) seemed too difficult . this indicative his technical ability director , which despite less " showy " schemata white still oozes out screen . this great director top his game . comedy three colours white [ trzy kolory bialy polish , way , language film mostly ] mostly comes its absurd plo t-t wists , which heaped top each other until you can't help but laugh ... but emotions very real , very recognisable even while you're guffawing idea man going france poland suitcase someone he hardly knows . while i think it would fair say this middle installment not impressive blue or red it still very thoughtful , very clever piece film-making most writers directors would give their right-arm involved . it takes sideways look its theme - white french flag represents " liberty " - gives discerning viewer pause reflection . kieslowski not spoon-feed his audiences , even rather straightforward narrative such this , so viewer left make up his or her own mind certain things . example : dominique love karol after all ? it excellent european cinema its influence seen many works followed since - surprisingly enough perhaps work lars von trier , who also goes uncomfortable laughs , occasional absurdism slantwise looks morality ethics . extras disc also worth . it fascinating see kiewslowski talk his life his work such detail ( he didn't leave anything his movies chance deeply thoughtful man . shame he didn't think quitting chain-smoking , he may lasted longer ! ) adds your enjoyment his work . this well worth taking look .	-1

this movie pretty awful . since i am ranking it 1 star , then according reviewer i must not soul . hey , it doesn't feel bad ! this movie worst black stereotyping any movie i ever seen , particularly sci-fi movie . it worse than blaxploitation films 70 , which least entertaining . this movie group teenage white kids , one token black thrown just hell it . " but just how ' black ' he ?, " you may wondering . well movie makes it clear he true soul man because it goes out its way establish these facts : 1 . he talks different whites . ( " hey bodee . " " his name bodhi ! " " well you say it your way , i'll say it mine . " or something effect . ) 2 . he breakdances . ( we all know all black people breakdance , can't they ? )3 . he likes basketball . ( again , every white person knows black people all like basketball they all good it , right ? )4 . he raps . ( because person isn't truly black unless they little hip-hop , they ? )i'm white guy . i'm not overly sensitive racism issues . but watching this movie really surprised me . i amazed see such blatant black stereotype . i can't say it good thing . it quite embarassing watch , actually . what where they thinking ? this movie would never made way today day age . movie itself pretty lame . it made back roller-blading / cyberpunk craze 80 . it usual bleak dystopian future typical those movies those days . it also features funky little ball named bodhi . it weirdest , most nonsensical story i ever watched . it almost like bad dream somebody wrote down soon they woke up , which later worked into screenplay . this movie so stupid it painful watch . only good reason see it see few young actors such jason patric ( lost boys ) jami gertz ( lost boys , twister , still standing ) . it also nice see richard jordan ( logan run ) , well stunning sarah douglas ( superman ii , conan destroyer ) starring villainess roll , usual . sarah douglas really make good villain , too . it too bad her talent so wasted this crapfest movie . " sphere longiness " ? ech ! i don't understand all you people who giving this movie 5 stars . i mean , what you thinking ? it just " i love 80 " nostalgia-factor kicking . i don't see any other rational reason this phenomenon . please . skating overgrown road ? skating dirt ? they'd get 10 feet before rock stuck their skates they went flying . it might fun watch if you make yourself believe rollerblades work sand . i'd say , other dystopian future skating flick , " prayer rollerboys " much better movie than this . course ain't saying much , because movie pretty much stinks too . buy something else . anything else . if not yourself , then least show black people world little basic human respect	-1

even though hollywood-driven glorification derrida superhero philosophy annoying -- if not furiating times , video , however , suceed unveiling fundamental character traits philosopher . namely , documentary revealed derrida reserved himself idiotic probing into his personal sex life which , needless say if granted , editors/director would exploit marketing stupified masses ( same masses who only buy-into dramatized or " controversial " ) . reason alone - derrida himself recognized this , counter it , distanced himself exploitative questions - it worth watching . since i not read any derrida work yet , i simply not say anything his philosophy . however , overly sensationalized/dramatized voice reading passages derrida philosophy offer some incredible insight into his thoughts .	1

i often heard people say all family could never produced today . i think this true , least , network television ( nbc , abc , cbs , fox ) . all family captures specific moment both television american history . carroll o'connor excellently renders american bigot , archie bunker , puts him up scrutiny before live audience . all family not entirely political correctness bigotry , but when you look back show , those social forces remain reasons why it couldn't produced today . six feet under , uncensored , would certainly no chance broadcast either . politically correct imperative contemporary american culture would sue complain it " wardrobe malfunction . " malfunction , however , emotional intellectual dishonesty most tv shows today , most mainstream culture today . i think almost all television cartoon . i like six feet under because it not not turn its homosexual characters into prancing man-boys grace . violence six feet under well earned integral drama comedy series . sex human relationships six feet under complicated weird , which completely normal . mostly , it refreshing watch show cares story character instead explosions , statutory sex objects , impossibly melodramatic events . if all family reflects political awakening , taught through comedy , then six feet under reflects response political correctness . bigotry all family responds monolithic misanthropic political correctness six feet under responding . bigotry political correctness merely two sides same dishonesty ; they rules codes human behavior expression not work out real life . archie bunker certainly not subtle guy , but his assumptions people different him wrong ( funny ) . now , when everything subtle politically correct eggshells , people no longer honest . that what six feet under me : we need relearn how trust others enough honest , i think six feet under accurately argues not all honesty mean , avoiding confrontation isn't always nice . end , hbo six feet under what networks used : respect intelligence , maturity , humanity audience	1

its not often nowadays we get chance see tour de france without complete focus exploits lance armstrong , rider extraordinaire , triathlete , marathoner , etc . etc . while i respect admire armstrong accomplishments much next fan , this movie isn't lance . likewise , its not phil paul their increasingly tiresome oln coverage . so what hell wheels all ? its german film ( yes , german but clearly visible english subtitles ) follows telekom boys during 2003 tour de france , epic battle fore-mentioned lance jan ullrich ( who incidentally rode bianchi year ) . lance jan appear frequently but not principal characters . tyler hamilton ( who rode entire race broken collarbone ) andreas kloden ( who rode few stages broken coxyx also figure side characters . primary characters rolf aldag , erik zabel ( roomates ) their masseuse/assistant eule , grizzled old guy who looks like he seen his share riders come go . race footage , we hear older gentleman who appears spent little too much time tour archives he narrates great black white footage very first years . although he little out there , he lends french flair film . exhilarating takes tdf stages , beginning end , we see riders recovering , musing day performance , suffering fallout daily crashes , mountain stages , etc . we often hear erik rolf talking over race eule works out kinks massage table . zabel particular some soul searching he just can't seem come up sprint win . aldag takes mountain jersey , but next day cracks , showing us just how fleeting victory tdf - how phenomenal winners really . prepared stunning footage mountain stages where we see just how tough these stages bikers . camera work magnificent - integrating fixed television-style feed hand-held shots give viewer perspectives we never get oln or any other tv coverage . my favorite scene alps when armstrong , ullrich , mayo flash arm length - showing how incredibly fast these riders go up mountain passes . while non cyclists may or may not enjoy drama tour , cyclists definitely groove racing footage . euro-pop sound track plenty solid bass sounds great dolby surround all class . i've watched video movie used it while trainer - either way its great buy ! gte it yourself or your favorite cyclist - they'll love it	1

i watched this documentary pbs i must say it one best ones i seen my whole life . it extremely disturbing too , because it sadly reminds us what human still capable . murder almost one million lives couple weeks shame whole mankind . international community nothing stop killings , un always deplorable soi-disant civilised world , i.e. usa , france , uk , belgium , germany et alii , not mind intervene political reasons , although time usa marines nearby burundi . clinton administration kofi annan(at time chief peace keeping operations ) absolutely nothing concrete but uttering stupid , useless rhetorical technical speeches . not mention shameful , coward stance belgian government panicked withdrew its troops citizens . real heroes bunch canadian african troops their very best protect remaining tutsis moderate hutus therefore deserve our biggest praises all their efforts . again , it one more appalling moment human history . it seems we never learn . among scenes shocked me forever sad images dead bodies drifted away rwandan river little girl , nowadays lady , found alive among dead bodies her family . this dvd provides wonderful opportunity think over sordid noxious nature european colonialism africa , after all , rwanda belgian colony belgian fomented apartheid tutsis hutus through , among other things , use id cards stating their ethnicity . it also shows dangers hands-off policies when intervention morally rightly justified required . this must-have dvd . please , let us not allow rwanda happen again ..	1
i could not help but watch this film all my african american female sensibilities . despite proficient acting , cinematography directing , i found content highly offensive trite . mr. kinksy claimed love shanduri willing anything possess her affections . he put off find out shanduri married , but not deterred . shanduri gave him what she believed unattainable challenge her husband , who arrested speaking out against government , freed african prison . i recognize it possible servant fall love her employer , however i know it extremely rare . ( ask any black woman who cleaned white person house , `how much love you your boss . ' relationship shanduri mr. kinksy one abuse power emotional manipulation . during `relationship ' i watched develop , not once shanduri refer her employer his first name . clearly indicating uneven balance power control ... not much different slave owner offering free his children born his african concubine . so , mr. kinksy gave up some his prized possessions ; it european influence created climate allowed shanduri husband detained indefinitely . though i am one among several different review film , i no reason forget long history abuse past present women color experienced hands white people , especially white men . see such film insult example how europeans not understand masses african americans	-1

some may think supernatural stories played out . we've plenty here states we're getting much more overseas . what i love each these movies they're not so repetitive . you get tired seeing same thing over over again , but these kind thrillers we always get something different . sure ghosts there but stories different way characters presented what makes each film stand alone . there some many movies i name which carry same overall topic but each those movies you see stores different each other one way or . you don't watch these movies scares even though it fun scared . you just sit down watch it story relationships characters . heirloom me one those movies . sure it movie unknown supernatural force but it films story draws you . heirloom isn't really scary i don't believe it made scary movie . what makes heirloom so great powerful plot twists you figure out you go . heirloom tells story man who inherits old family house . he checks place out he decides move bring his fianc ? . they stay house man slowly begins remember parts his childhood , bringing back old memories forgotten age . house dark history , which thirty years prior entire family attended bizarre rituals ended up committing suicide all same time . each relative hung rope die . while man unaware his family history he begins witness some strange happenings involving old house . friends appearing house out nowhere others killed off weird mysterious causes . it house itself or there something evil going ? we soon find out couple dig deeper into family history what really went thirty years ago . now this movie definitely worth watching . story great even though not all it original . but way it played out scene scene different when you figure out mystery behind everything it not pleasant all . heirloom features one most disturbing plot turns i've ever seen . it not graphic but idea everything so twisted wrong story just completely drives you . heirloom very dramatic horror film heart pounding mystery , likeable characters good story all around . plot dialog movie what really makes it good watch . it so long since i've bothered twist heirloom really good job letting story unfold dialog disturbing flashbacks . most movie we fallow couple who try find out mystery behind house all weird events taken place over last week . overall subject deals family curses , punishments characters who deal same fate . movie beautifully shot , using different views inside house give it more creepy feeling house itself large contains dark history . lot scenes blend together flash backs tell story give it more questionable approach what answer everything . like most mysterious you don't get know everything until near end . which also when we get see more these flashbacks , near end explains it all . overall look heirloom also really good . art design fantastic you really believe characters staying old house . nothing looks too fake or obvious . locations fine spice things up film also simple yet perfectly fitting score . music sets up mood each scene should enough draw your attention . heirloom well made good looking film which i really recommend watching . also sure check out bonus features understand more making it . if you want see movie scare living daylights out you , then look somewhere else . heirloom isn't kind movie watch scares , or blood guts matter . like many movies involving supernatural mysteries heirloom plot dialog driven film . using story characters set mood you guessing until end . but trust me when i say it not pleasant . there no happy endings or events this picture . story very dark unsettling times . watch heirloom mystery , not action or huge body count . if you sit down pay attention all way through then you rewarded . it good movie doesn't supply scares blood get viewers attention . there plenty drama mystery	-1
i understand every generation desire remake or reinterpret classic dramas , plays literature , this case , henry james psychological ghost story , " turn screw . " however , 21st century filmmakers should know now : modern newer not necessarily better . less more producers should realized when they considered this remake . outstanding remarkable 1961 adaptation " innocents " ghosts or apparitions most part seen briefly distance . music , sound effects , stunning cinematography made apparitions children precocious behavior even more chilling disconcerting . this drama doesn't work following reasons : ghosts revealed close-up , realistic lingering shots . they neither mysterious nor frightening . children unappealing not terribly convincing ; other words very badly cast . most surprisingly , very talented jodhi may who should perfect this role somehow simultaneously grim blank beginning ; she gives us little insight into her character . overall , this disappointing adaptatio	-1

" ronin " sets out telling viewer some samurai warriors who shamed when their lord killed , via treachery , lord . this made them " ronin " - or rogues . movie itself bore scant resemblance legend it quoted -- which only one its shortcomings . robert deniro phones performance , though jean reno creditable job his ally vincen t.t he film follows formation mysterious , multi-national gang criminals hired mysterious irish woman retrieve mysterious silver case . gang doesn't know what case , who they working or each other . there lots gunplay , plenty car chases , faintly interesting locales french riviera paris , lots collateral damage civilians . what seems propel movie lack clarity motives gang members purpose their activities . seemingly , this intended writers , who wanted show criminals ( or they ? ) furiously fighting dying cause they not understand , long lucrative reward awaited them . viewer , however , unfolding drama only reason keep watching this dud film . all its vaunted samurai connections , ronin disappointing . car chases dull seemed interminable . accidents caused thereby ludicrously overdramatic , lots flying sparks gasoline explosions . gunfights ridiculously one-sided . end film , silver case changed hands so many times movie started look like comedy routine . " ronin " standard shoot-em-up thriller fails deliver its pretentious samurai metaphor . hence , 3 stars shrug-shouldered " eh .	-1

this documentary uses interviews trace origins linux , process , it provides interesting insight into open source movement its philosophy . richard stallman , founder gnu project , featured prominently throughout film . ( gnu set applications provide unix-compatible framework . ) he explains how gnu developed through open source environment , environment where code taken , modified , shared , but it cannot made proprietary . he also explains development gnu general public license which prohibits developers making code proprietary . during gnu development , linus torvalde , developing kernel -- which just piece missing open source environment . ( kernel use allocate resources other applications . ) this kernel became linux . stallman said , it would take years get gnu linux work together smoothly , but eventually things would take off . although linux started 1991 10,000 lines code , it might remained hobbyist os , if it not apache web server . apache became ' killer app , ' business case buying linux . ( there interview shown brian behlendorf , president apache project . ) 1998 , linux 7.5 million users companies like red hat contributing its growth selling distribution suppor t.t his film also shows tug-of-war microsoft open source proponents . eric . raymond , author cathedral bazaar , describes some differences proprietary open source environments , he explains how his book one many influences netscape decision release their source code . you see interviews michael tieman ( co-founder cygnus technology ) larry augustin ( co-founder va linux ) . interview bruce perens , author open source definition , interesting . it used throughout film frame gnu linux development stories within open source context . also , perens lists ' rights ' open software , one senses open source philosophy one seriously thought out . overall , this interesting documentary . however , i'm giving it only 4 stars because i found segment end ( where torvalde augustin speaking ) very tedious . it didn't add content it seemed more like personal ' grand-standing . ' still , i'd recommend this film anyone who interested computer history or looking get better understanding what open source movement	-1

universal soldier one best action films jean claude van damme . film released 1993 . movie based awfully chilly idea secret government project use reanimated corpses dead soldiers universal soldiers . these soldiers really killer combat zombies programmed receive commands remotely . they extremely efficient killer machines impervious pain , quick heal , pretty much unstoppable although they tend overheat if they stay active too long . this movie , jean-claude van damme stars man who supposedly killed war vietnam . he revived secret biochemical , regenerative experiment cyborg controlled people who made him . project initially proceeds according plan . however , van damme starts recalling memories series flashes his past , he eventually remembers bloodthirsty , psychotic vindictive sergeant ( dolph lundgren ) , who also now turned into cyborg , evil core . fight them resumes where they left when they alive . action really gets hot when van damme regains his memory eventually leads his freedom controlled his creators . but creators not prepared let van damme go free without them doing everything they get him back under their control once again . both jean-claude van damme dolph lundgren play their respective roles exceptionally well . pretty sexy alley walker , who plays reporter who joins van damme his fight against universal soldier , also gives good performance . those who love action movies thrilled fierce fist fights , unforgettable stunts kickboxing action compel you watch it again again . i recommend anybody who likes van damme movies or good action movies get " universal soldier . " it not best storyline or best plot , but it entertaining exciting all same .	1
first , i don't think edward norton made bad film . he definitely doesn't disappoint here either . very clever role paul giamatti well . this movie prestige wanted . all its big name actors , i think it overshadowed illusionist just bit . prestige leaves us stunned thinking magicians possess supernatural powers , but that not what we want believe . we're satisfied because magicians gave away few secrets , but not ones we wanted them . illusionist tricks us much same way , but doesn't create hype going above beyond realm real magic . we still stunned , but we still told it only trick . we believe it . beautiful cinema . superb acting . excellent music score . excellently paced well . i wasn't bored . prestige , i felt like they could trimmed it little without taking away film , but it still distracting . illusionist grabs your full attention doesn't let go . we get good show , enough it leaves you wanting more . just magic show should ! good illusion	1

since today 9-11 , before i begin my review , i would like take this opportunity express my condolences families their loved-ones who lost their lives fateful horrific day 9-11 . time heals but you never forget . ( i know i won't i wasn't even there . ) j.l. i doing review classic " jimi plays monterey/shake ! otis monterey " originally released 1967 two rock ' roll greatest legends , late great jimi hendrix ( born 26 november 1942 , died 18 september 1970 ) jimi hendrix experience late great otis redding . ( born 9 september 1941 , died 10 december 1967 ) i also editing this review time time so you consumer get best most accurate review possible . first , jimi hendrix . what i say this legendary guitarist hasn't already said ? my opinion , johnny allen hendrix ( original name before his father al hendrix changed it james marshall hendrix . ) forever go down history greatest guitarist rock ' roll ever produced . maybe i should add more statement . jimi hendrix forever go down music history greatest guitarist ever picked up instrument . please remember hard it seems believe , guitarist myself , jimi hendrix " self taught " guitarist . nobody taught jimi play way he . then it dawned me , nobody this world could ever taught jimi how play guitar way he . jimi hendrix born god-given gift naturally pick up instrument just teach himself how play guitar , simple . jimi hendrix so far ahead his time it took years before his well-respected contemporaries would catch up him . jimi hendrix complete guitarist , playing both rhythm lead guitars consistently well while handling singing duties . most bands nowadays separate lead singer , rhythm guitarist lead guitarist . there many great guitarists passed through rock ' roll history ; legendary guitarists such chuck berry , late great eddie cochran , late great buddy holly , late great ritchie valens , peter green , eric clapton , jeff beck , jimmy page , santana , robin trower , keith richards , dave davies , peter frampton , pete townshend , ritchie blackmore , late great stevie ray vaughn , joe perry , angus young , late great terry kath , late great randy rhodes , joe satriani frank marino . i'm sure there many other legendary guitar greats i failed mention i apologize . but jimi hendrix guitarist ( man ) re-wrote rules how guitar would played . hendrix also rewrote rules how guitar would presented out front lead reckoned instrument . hendrix would become extremely well known playing guitar his teeth , behind his head , behind his back his legs . what guitarist doing this prior hendrix ? hendrix even popularized instrument even more than his past predecessors . i mean no disrespect any way past guitar greats , especially blues greats . i don't believe any legendary guitar greats whether they played blues , country or rock ever deny accomplishments jimi hendrix such short time . ( two half years ) most guitarists almost take their whole career accomplish what jimi just two half years . many rock critics well certain friends believe jimi , like blues great robert johnson mighty led zeppelin , sold his soul devil exchange greatest guitarist ever lived . this statement true or it myth ? i leave up you decide . enough , lets get review . " jimi plays monterey " quite simply , " rock history making ! " this concert also marks jimi first u.s. appearance . ( jimi , native american , two british musicians named noel redding bass mitch mitchell drums , became star england before he became star his own country . ) this performance single-handedly gave birth ultimate performance lifetime jimi hendrix experience . all legendary rumors backstage talk took place jimi hendrix pete townshend who which band wasn't going follow other , i highly recommend 1992 released book simply entitled , " monterey pop , " written joel selvin great photos veteran rock photographer jim marshall . selvin researched backstage moments hendrix townshend finally answers questions quoted page 92 , third paragraph : backstage , pete townshend who angrily confronted jimi hendrix . townshend accused hendrix stealing his act ( hendrix admitted he but made it better ) , two continued arguing back forth who would follow who . townshend still smarting experience followed hendrix earlier year london saville theatre . legend it , front legendary contemporary spectators such eric clapton , brian jones janis joplin , late john phillips mama papa get separate two artists resolve matter flip coin . who won toss who went first . jimi hendrix quoted saying after coin toss , " if i follow who , then i'm going pull all stops . " eric burden animals quoted saying during introduction who : " i promise you this group who calls themselves who destroy you more ways than one . " who took stage bad intentions performed blistering set which resulted total destruction their instruments end . who crazily leaving stage , pete townshend quoted telling jimi , " follow !

plot : 23rd century kirk presumed dead but actually thrust into " nexus , " mysterious dimension perpetual bliss where time no meaning . 24th century captain picard also enters nexus . he meets convinces kirk they must leave their unreal paradise go back 24th century prevent soran , man bent returning nexus all costs , destroying entire solar system millions lives . analysis : before seeing this film i heard highly contrasting reports : some claimed it one best star trek films while others , like trek-spert mark altman , lambasted it incredible soporific dud . i've also heard it referred " merely passable . " well , i've seen film four times now my respect grows each viewing . i certainly see why some don't like it or don't ' get ' it : " generations " some ( apparent ) plot holes some things aren't spelled-out or explained very well ( so what ? doesn't mystery intrinsically come territory space adventure ? ) ; plus story just plain convuluted . regardless , i feel " generations " ambitious , high-concept sci-fi highest order ; it leaves viewer many interestng questions ponder long afterwards . although nexus beeen criticized mere gimmick get kirk picard together , i find concept utterly fascinating : no matter how much we want it , illusory paradise just -- illusion . far i'm concerned , concept nexus its implementation into storyline nothing short brilliant . besides this , there incredible number highlights : usual trek humor , data amusing experiences emotion chip , malcolm mcdowell outstanding performance mad soran , soran believable obsession justifications , b'etor lursa their " wild bunch " klingons , startling obliteration them their vessel , thrilling crash-landing enterprise-d , meeting kirk picard nexus , final showdown soran kirk death ( disregarding lame " oh my " ) . needless say , " generations " far more than offer mere juvenile space battles . biggest plot hole ( or maybe not ): picard purpose leaving nexus stop soran annihilating enerprise-d crew entire veridian solar system , including 230 million people live veridian iv . since picard leave nexus " go anywhere any time , " guinan pointed out earlier , why go veridian iii minute before soran launches his rocket ? why not go back when soran guest enterprise-d apprehend him then there ? writer ronald . moore defended picard decision grounds he didn't want risk dangerous unexpected consequences occur when tampering timeline ; hence , his journey back time nexus only matter minute or so . hmmm , it good explanation i accept it . second biggest plot hole : if soran rocket-probe powerful enough effect quantum implosion veridian star , would it not cause quite bit more damage veridian iii when it explodes ? surely both picard ( who merely hides behind rock outcropping ) kirk would utterly obliterated entire immediate surroundings planet ? explanation : some criticized fact guinan simultaneously present real world nexus . how could this ? it simple : it repeatedly established reality experienced nexus not real ; one experiences what they desire nexus , not what real . instance , picard no children real world , but because he desired them he able experience them nexus . hence , ' guinan ' portrayed nexus may walk , talk act precisely like guinan , but she not real . she only there because picard desires her there purpose explaining nature nexus . capeesh ? commentary nexus : although nexus should simply taken face value strange space phenomenon , one also regard it analogy . first glance one might get impression nexus type heaven , but this can't so since it repeatedly emphasized film people events experiened nexus not real . ' heaven , ' term theologians ministers traditionally use refer eternal abode redeemed ( technically referred " new heavens new earth " bible ~ 2 peter 3:13 ) , -- contrast -- always depicted real bible , not illusory paradise . if nexus not analgous heaven , what could it type ? nexus corresponds any addiction person " tastes " embraces escape reality ( e.g. drugs , alcohol , computer games , tv , porn , fishing , shopping , golf , etc . ) some , like soran , unable flee its clutches waste their lives talents obsessed it . others , like picard kirk , able see truth escape ; they therefore " make difference " real life . bottom line : this " passing-of-the-torch " installment requires attention span appreciation high-concept sci-fi ; it bore tears those whom star trek only means neato spacecrafts superficial space dogfights ( don't get me wrong , they each their place star trek ) . " generations " courage make bold changes -- killing off major iconic character , fairly prominent support characters well , not mention destroying enterprise-d . " generations " science-fiction grown-ups youth advanced cerebral development . all others should stick star wars " zathura " ( giggle ) .	1

hornblower fan many decades , i am very disappointed this movie . ioan gruffud portrays hornblower who almost modern high school delinquent - kind who walks front your car when you drive near public hs show he " cool " or " big man " . whereas this may appeal someone who sports " question authority " sticker , it not hornblower i know . overall , it seems movies not too well one greatest heroes fiction - but least gregory peck hornblower decent - this one not quite material which commodore hornblower made ... kind person portrayed gruffud , above all , childish ( we all know , " cool " same " cute " ) . perhaps other ones this ioan gruffud better , but these two bad enough they keep me buying others	-1

legend rita generally excellent film . rita vogt belongs small faction terrorists who rob banks commit other crimes " support revolution " 1970s west germany . get-go , movie fast-paced exciting , robberies fights among terrorists highlighted quick scene changes . rita , fleeing west german police , ultimately takes refuge east germany then given " legends , " i.e. , identities , disguise her presence country . although character completely fictional , rita appears resemble , both physically otherwise , red army faction member susanne albrecht , who given asylum new identity east germany ( although albrecht not participate jailbreak . ) rita idolizes east germany pleased live " true socialist state " - position becomes untenable after wall falls 1989 . film strikes note truth it contrasts east germany seen through rita rose-colored glasses country it seen its own citizens . rita faith , enthusiasm , socialism blinds her dreariness east german life , which drives other characters film drink . said , this portrayal raf ( although group not named ) terrorist far too sanitized . liner notes , director refers real raf " so-called " terrorists . film , we shown apparently accidental murder attorney mid-jailbreak , murder policeman who trying catch rita . both these murders rationalized ( those who wish rationalize them ) crazed attempts prevent arrest or continued imprisonment . reality , raf deliberately , malice aforethought , murdered innocent people . susanne albrecht , example , deliberately lured jurgen ponto , chairman dresdner bank albrecht godfather , his death . raf faction killed heinz hillegart , german economic attache sweden , hung his corpse out window . they kidnapped peter lorenz , christian democrat candidate mayor west berlin . raf joined other terrorists hijacking air france jetliner entebbe . they separated jews all other passengers threatened kill them -- would , israeli force led jonathan netanyahu not rescued hostages . short , this bad , bad , bad gang , - if indeed schlondorff portraying raf - it no good sugar-coat them . while film shows stasi helping terrorists -- which indeed happen -- it shows stasi men far too genial my taste . stasi portrayed simply enthusiasts , who romanticize revolutionary spirit terrorists try live vicariously through their exploits . fact , demonstrated elsewhere , relationship stasi various terrorist groups symbiotic : it part east german policy , determined highest level politburo encouragement soviet union , arm train them . despite these flaws , i highly recommend film . it provides very realistic portrayal east germany , right down prefabricated houses workplace collections worldwide revolutionary movements . spy agency " comrade general " shown hunting , which favorite activity stasi commander erich mielke . moreover , bibliana beglau terrific actress , her portrayal rita convincing . we never completely sure why rita joined gang -- it really love , or her obvious sympathies lead her over edge ? finally , film raises some important issues youthful mistakes perspective middle age . overall , film well worth watching .	-1

there not much more added what already written or said russia love . it considered one better bond films series . before i get main point what i add , i want comment widescreen versions issued . i am not sure what proper aspect ratio this film . comparison dvd laser disc , dvd appears cropped top bottom give it wider effect . proportions prints i saw several theaters all resembled laser disc . my more important note curiosity however content film itself . i still not seen any version vhs , laser or dvd ones i seen theater russia love . it appears video two scenes contain cuts . cut # 1 : when red grant bond his knees gunpoint aboard orient express , he editorializes most graphic manner roll film shot bond tatiana boudoir . its time , this rather risqu� piece dialogue . today standards it somewhat timid . bond comeback still intact video , responding grant how it took collection pretty sick minds dream up such scheme . direct response grant cut line gives us insight into bond moral standards there line even he would not cross given his flare more amorous pursuits . cut # 2 : this cut line more obvious comes end film when bond tatiana floating down canals venice . bond holds up reel film seized grant . again , bond makes direct reference grant cut line train droll throwaway remark puzzled looking tatiana . you actually see this cut because music jumps . once more , this cut line dialogue gives us glimpse into james bond mystique it still formed honed screen . i am sure bond probably saying himself , " take all dirty pictures you want . i'm one girl grant , " old boy , " you're one six feet under . " film itself , it one classic james bond films remain so all time . tone series would altered slightly what director terence young established dr . no this film . next film , goldfinger directed guy hamilton , would retain style established terence young yet he would refine character james bond more tongue-in-cheek approach . russia love james bond dedicated civil servant licence kill he uses it assassination krilencu ( fred haggerty ) just coldly objectively he eliminated professor dent ( anthony dawson ) dr . no . these reasons i believe there two distinct camps ranks bond loyalists . one prefers style or more specifically portrayal james bond found russia love , while other faction favors established goldfinger . james bond found russia love much tougher fellow not seen again until her majesty secret service licence kill . specific point russia love score composed john barry . barry score this film not complex or melodically constructed his subsequent bond scores . yet , barry score old school sean connery approach role exactly way it should . barry no-frills score compliments connery no nonsense bond . essence russia love product its time very good one .	1
it such great idea release these shows dvd packaging these two volumes really inventive . however , great packaging doesn't make great dvd . quality shows these dvds bottom barrel . i am actually surprised they gall release these . literally , picture quality " pinballs " episode , i am not exaggerating here , same third generation vhs cassette if show taped off broadcast television . without benefit cable . extras actually worse . extras consist still frames shows blown up fill screen . images completely blown out pixelated . i would preferred no " extras " than something this bad . i don't know if it blessing these shows available all or if it just plain insulting this company asking people pay these horrible reproductions . overall i think this dvd embarrassment . what shame	-1

okay , let brief : if you didn't grow up horror lovin ' 80 or not established fan italian horror films , this movie probably won't work you . this unofficial sequel romero " dawn dead " ( 1978 version course ) made primary italian audiences when dawn released there under title " zombi " . even though this one doesn't take place mall or feature anything or anyone like original storyline dawn , it almost same feel . eventually america , this film came us english dubbed audio under title " zombie " . but now shriek show finally released remastered 2 disc set this classic movie fully uncut first time states . or so i thought . ya see , when movie starts , there brief scene set-up ( it always ) , then it goes into opening credits . i expecting see original italian credits showing it finally under it original title " zombi 2 " , like box . but it isn't , it american version title " zombie " . nitpicking , huh ? but after little searching i found easter egg shows original title sequence finally shows this film called " zombi 2 " . here how get it ( it easy .... ) : disc one go " features " section . there , press number " 6 " your remote . it activate red skull button upper right screen ( you can't activate it searching around menu your arrow buttons , very rare easter egg standards ! ) , it press button automatically take you original italian opening credits clearly show this film called " zombi 2 " , logo all . also , after they're , it show alternate end credits , but honestly i couldn't see any difference them opposed ones movie now . all all , this movie never looked or sounded better ever . some say it looks too cleaned up now . they might point because picture so perfect now ( colors bright , sharp image , brightness exact , sound crisp , etc ) it gives away effects movie . well , i'd rather this movie perfect picture than dark , grainy vhs anyday . this movie classic piece horror history should owned ( especially shriek show 25th anniversary version ... extras here superior .... making documentary long movie itself ! ) anyone two or more " living dead/zombie " dvd already their collection . i'm glad i got it , this way classic horror should re-release d.p.s. : if you look hard enough ( dvd trailer section their previews ) , there " zombi 3 " " zombie 4 " movies out there too . trust me , you don't need them or want them , they don't same feel or quality " zombi 2 " or " dawn dead " . just happy their trailers . enjoy	1

i bought this dvd because it cheap , i figured i could not go wrong old hitchcock classic . first two minutes film gave me some doubts , sound quality opening music poor ( i thought sound fine after picture quality very good ) . then story got going , i amazed . this film really needs appreciated two levels . first , it wonderfully pleasant thriller . it script days when they cared writing good dialogue . it quite witty , pleasantly sexy , latter family-friendly way nonetheless more engaging than so much modern , explicit material . but second level what makes this film so astonishing . it made 1938 england . time , appeasement official policy british government most british press . fact , film censorship board would not even allow words " german " or " nazi " used connection bad guys . film nonetheless manages suggest utter evil nazism show utter bankruptcy appeasement . what most intriguing , film cleverly shows variety people who just don't want get involved any nastiness , one reason or , but who true british hearts gold come through wonderfully once fight proves unavoidable . my pleasure this wonderful film mixed few counts . first , course , sadness film proved so amazingly prophetic tragedy years followed . second this film so little known , when it should rights part history curriculum every student learns high school . third this film just meaningful us today it when it made . alas , it just may we living 1938 all over again .	1

i seen bits pieces woody allen " zelig " before but i never seen whole movie until last night . honest , my initial reaction wonder if i would able maintain interest throughout whole movie . it turned out , no problem . " zelig " tells story individual who developed unexplainable ability appear like people his surroundings . it presented documentary format format amazingly well . i'm opinion there plenty actual newsreel footage 1920 ' 30 there also plenty new film made appear it era . i never certain which which because cinematography well . retrospective interviews present day theorists aged contemporaries butressed documentary nature film ( continuous narration ) . title character ( played woody allen ) assumes more more identities , we come understand his efforts like others leaves him no identity his own . i understood allen message expression his frustration negative public reaction his post- " annie hall " movies . he wasn't making kinds pictures everyone else his uniqueness dismissed . i saw him making statement banality lacks meaning satirizing someone who went out his way avoid himself . maybe allen higher purpose making " zelig " but i comfortable message i got out it .	-1

" arabian nights " tells timeless tale scheherazade imaginary stories which she enthralled her husband , sultan schahriar , order save her life , over span " thousand one arabian nights . " this lavish visually stunning production brims fantastic images , fabulous sets costumes , compelling characterizations , interesting stories exotic locations . updated version five classic 2,500 -year-old fantasies popularized 1800s sir richard burton , it features such memorable figures aladdin , ali baba genie lamp . it sure captivate viewers young old . i found it especially enjoyable because it filmed entirely location morocco turkey . vacationed both these countries , i recognized some locations , such leather tanneries fez , morocco , other-worldly rock formations cappadocia near goreme , turkey . sets buildings overflow exquisite detailing common islamic architecture . it treat eye take all rich , delicate decorations each scene realize , many cases , these real places , not simply movie sets . you easily view main feature , running just less than three hours , single sitting . but more likely you'll split it up over several days , 40 convenient chapter stops nicely divide it up into bite-sized segments . special features include fairly typical 13-minute " making " documentary , cast crew biographies production notes . there just few areas i found less than fully satisfying " arabian nights , " but none them detracted my enjoyment story . first , sound volume clarity tended fluctuate , sometimes it hard understand dialogue ( this common problem many dvds ) . second , computer graphics , while quite good overall , not up latest standards set likes " lord rings " " king kong . " instance , " dragons " guarding cave full treasures discovered ali baba not particularly well-rendered , digital " smoke " appears many scenes too obviously cgi . finally , there few deliberate " modernisms " speech or actions , or subtle pop-culture references modern times . first this little jarring , but i soon accepted it spirit which it probably intended . think " xena : warrior princess " you'll understand what i mean . this great dvd whole family enjoy . i heartily recommend " arabian nights " anyone interested spending few pleasant hours magical world sibling rivalry , palace intrigue , genies flying carpets	-1

ok ......... right off bat , we normally love psychological thrillers make you think opposed mindless " 6 kids woods getting slashed " type garbage . however sublime fails many levels .... 1 ) you know what story going 15 minutes into film , so there no element surprise end develops . 2 ) spoiler alert .......................................................................................................... " dream " / " hallucination " ( trying not spoil too bad ) scenes lose all creepiness because they simply silly stupid opposed frightening . 3 ) all characters so odd , you really never care george , his wife , his kids or anybody matter . all all it came across movie trying very " artsy-fartsy " trying create mystery editing together random erratic hallucinatory sequences simply sake confusing opposed intriguing storytelling . we suckered fact one producers tv show " 24 " involved this project . but not help this film all .	-1
fan since 1981 i gave up after ' 86-'88 when it all started sounding same me . last cd i really liked powerslave ( actually album time !! ) . but friend this i must say i liked it lot several new songs immediately caught my ear !!! when i found " bloodbrothers " " dream mirrors " off same cd i went bought " brave new world " really enjoyed it . it reminds me classic era i really don't understand fans underrating this cd . oh well . it also pretty good representation older material though i several better versions my all time favorite - " hallowed thy name " . band top form it very refreshing hear one great voices metal hasn't diminished age like so many others !! bruce must secret coverdale , gillan , etc , etc don't know !!! but , you guess title this review , i won't truly happy until they pull their heads out release classic " live after death " 5.1 dvd ; i just worn out vhs !!! bruce , steve , dave ... guys ..... come ... please !!!	-1

hello , first all , if you one those people who feel 2001 pure genius , you feel anything else would pure crap -- you know who you , then don't waste your time this . however , if you really loved 2001 , really cared david bowman , discovery , hal , wanted see what happened next , this you . when book came out i captivated , pure simple . course , since there no ussr now , tension lost those too young remember , but watching this again last night really brought back those times me . chinese parts europa left out greatly missed me . but , this story/movie very very good . technology sets incredible , acting very good , seeing david bowman again chilling . after film over , i immediately got out my 2063 book read what happened right this mission , while i don't remember loving book , it very interesting read first 50 pages or so again after so many years . ok , enough rambling , enjoy this , or , stay up your pedastal continue look down rest us who watch enjoy something isn't 10 out 10 stars pure genius !! cheers , jaderai	-1

this traditional telling life jesus , before his birth resurrection . cinematography breathtaking , color , costuming , writing aided carl sandberg flawless inspired scene jesus weeping then raising lazarus dead awe inspiring . it this scene which motivated me write this review . rather than showing us thunderous awakening dead within tomb , stevens jesus lift hem his toga make difficult climb up rocky bluff , puffing all way tomb top hill . once there , jesus strikes pose made popular style ivan mestrovic french bronze sculptors mid twentieth century . when jesus reaches high tomb , stevens sandberg compose masterpiece prayer god life before jesus calls out , " lazarus ! come forth ! " but striking juxtaposition , stevens pulls back camera , hundreds feet tomb showing jesus , son almighty , mere speck against infinity countryside , let alone universe , much fist fight charlton heston gregory peck big country , shows scale man god work . however , jesus calls-out lazarus instead seeing him rise , we see wonderment , bewilderment , fear love men prospect one man raising abyss . we see crowd , camera dollies , rolls scans , faces believers , unbelievers , doubters ever faithful , their reactions man dead three days , reawakened act god , brought forth human , favored god . how much more effective this direction ? rather than straw man seeing dead rise , we see instead how people like us would react such thing , awe , tears joy , fear , love , attempts reconcile reality , unbelievable . there no better way show spectacle scene alone must-see aspiring artist or film director . my only complaint film nitpicky one , jesus ' ( max von sydow ) hair too short . if you believe , clap your hands , even if you don't , its worth 199 minutes your time . i saw film friends when it came out 1965 own vhs dvd , watched it group , one which self-proclaimed atheist-he tears his eyes lazarus scene . 4.75 star	1
it tough call me first third seasons . i found first season memorable because it many classic gags , i enjoyed relative simplicity stories , they seemed more focus " prehistoric " aspects . i've always loved episode " flintstone flyer " , i even remember building model flyer scratch when i kid . although they've always denied connection honeymooners , least few stories seem like rehashed honeymooners episodes . third season more involved plots , running theme " wilma baby ! nope , not yet ... " lot more parody . would probably more appeal today adults , though i find many stories too bizarre believable . ( i sorta buy idea human-powered helicopter made out wood , it fits cartoon physics ... but third-season " foxy grandma " episode involving old woman bank-robber who throws dynamite sticks just too much . ) second season wasn't strong , many plots seemed like repeats first season it lost much prehistoric charm . while i'll buy complete fourth season just round out collection , those shows typically my least favorite far . they went much too far bizarre stories ; i never liked great gazoo or uber-strong bamm-bamm , there way too much emphasis kids doing totally unbelievable things . what ultimately killed original flintstones series lack consistency writing portrayal characters , few or no running threads throughout show , tendency cartoons back then ( even many ordinary shows ) become increasingly outlandish over time . they seemed lost their original focus cartoon adults , especially last season -- though granted it fairly novel idea " real " human characters doing human things cartoon , so i'll cut them some slack . quality dvds this set much same others , although i notice two or three episodes noticeable ( but not horrible ) video noise , couple episodes lower-than-normal audio levels ( just crank up volume bit those ) . probably just means they couldn't find original sources some them resort other means ... i haven't checked out extras , though this set they used both sides last disc hold episodes instead using flip side extras . here my take : if you're not familiar flintstones then start first season , it most firmly grounded four seasons . if you really like it , check out some others . third-season episodes some best , but there few stinkers	1

charming delightful completion doris day film career . always , her supporting cast full talented character actors upcoming stars . i just rewatched dvd , found new interesting tidbits . robert mersey composed score film ( after doing some research , he also involved streisand ' color me barbra ' tv special ) . particular interest , there recurring musical theme throughout movie , highly reminiscent wildly successful musical which debuted 2 years after release this film - not composed mersey . i am surprised no one noticed it before . see film , listen music , enjoy wonderful doris day	1

this movie reminds me why i'd never want desk job . i watch it couple times before i got full gist it , but every time , i understood it more more . unless you're self-employed work home , you can't help but draw your own similarities office space work environment your own . i've worked lumberg , joanna , michael ... guy who didn't arabic name , but he wanted beat up every piece office machinery which didn't work right . we even milton-like guy once ... he ended up going berserk escorted out police , but that story . all all , i highly recommend this movie everyone who job knows what it like suffer aggravation office politics . this movie delivers figurative eye-gouging all politics backstabbing goes every day america corporate workplaces . it shows one things happen when big corporate ceos think they're making some really smart move , end up shooting themselves foot instead . words warning : 1 ) if you're bureaucratic jerk boss like lumberg , not watch this movie because you won't find it funny ... 2 ) never , ever anything make milton angry , because you never know what they'll	1
i this series vhs , after watched it least three times , still really enjoy it . i find it well-written , well-acted , well-paced , interesting take usual male spy story . woman , i admittedly enjoy stories women who succeed difficult tasks . two women who star this series face extremely difficult task -- pass frenchwomen occupied france , despite spent majority their lives england , while passing secrets under noses ever-watchful germans . unlike reviewer , i won't try say whether members other sex like it or not . i don't see it chick flick all -- simply story spies wwii which features women who spies , well men . jill hyem fine writer this fine wwii drama . if you're looking lots battle scenes , however , this isn't it . this people , not weapons , life among enemy . i recommend it	1

i never knew " whole story " behind joni mitchell seeing it here made me want sing her praises every rooftop ! while i own just few joni mitchell recordings , i always felt connected artist . this dvd explains why . this story independent spirit , heartfelt mind courageous idealist . this reveals what lies behind most artistically diverse female date . her willingness share her soul so we might share our own beyond commendable . her passion true herself her fans makes her artist beyond others . once you see dvd you understand her process like never before . you also hear most adulated artists admit her self-taught writing , singing musical abilities put them all shame . joni mitchell shared her gift , it entirety , world . she honest steadfast her pursuit never sold out marketing nor crumbled under mainstream critique . kudos all involved this dvd documentary masterfully interwoven artist discography . time it ends you know her inside out . i very much disagree writer who claims songs never complete , fact , i would say this dvd makes songs even more complete . must-have any joni mitchell fan must any fan musician-documentary genre this finest i seen . add must-have fans human spirit	1

complex acting -- each character his her own " tell " -- tight story . if you liked mind games usual suspect , you'll like this . said : i don't know whether i've seen way too many movies , read too much confidence games , or ( least likely ) too smart my own good , but i least one step ahead story pretty much until very end	1
i'm very surprised negative reviews . while this dvd clearly not made walt disney studios , it what it supposed - introduce french words phrases children easy-to-follow way . actors speak authentic french . what taught quite useful - introductions , counting , colors , playing , food , etc . actors use these words phrases within simple storyline they again repeated during review section . they also repeated once more songs scattered throughout dvd ( songs pretty catchy way - more so than other children videos ) . so , if you looking pure entertainment , this video probably not you but if you want tool hold your child attention teach them french , then you should give this try .	1

( 4.5 /5 stars ) this fantasy film set during world war ii , nazis chasing jet-propelled backpack technology enable their airmen land enemy territory . there even mock nazi propaganda film illustrate awesome power this new weapon . fact , film really blurs fantasy reality , appearances w.c. fields cab calloway , among others . timothy dalton plays neville sinclair , actor whose life bears uncanny resemblance errol flynn . fiction mixed reality amusing because it offers imaginative alternative straight fiction non-fiction . other hand , " da vinci code , " " jfk " current bush administration all proven mixing fantasy reality produce downright ugly results . there some very good action rocketeer , played dashing handsome bill campbell , eludes nazis attempts foil their plot . jennifer connelly radiant his love interest , jenny blake . this type movie where gray areas not exist ; everything either black or white , good or bad . excellent sets , wardrobes , styles , etc ., this aids film establishing its nostalgic , 1940s feel . this very fun movie most family . even though there little objectionable material , some themes might better suited ages ten up .	1
i'm truly sorry say this season not good previous six . i blame writers , poor storyline many shows	-1
very well-made underappreciated cryptic horror movie small group performers hired stage private play strange family rich recluses ' deep woods ' . very mysterious , unique strain eerie sinister tension running throughout . much less dark note , features hot girl-on-girl scene wins lots bonus points not just sex scene but actually very affectionate bona fide love scene ( albeit rather brief side ) . other appreciated scenery includes lush , absolutely gorgeous forest within which movie takes place , captured well very fine cinematography . somehow placing subtle menace midst such beauty makes it seem all more dangerous . ambiguous film could go pretty much any direction it wanted if it sequel . should appeal fans everything " blair witch project " " friday 13th " " raising cain "	-1

one most notable features noir style resides ambivalence characters ; so nobody absolutely free guilty , why this genre always maintains edge knife , because we tendency sympathize someone , so surprise element furtive shadow flatten our best choice . other hand guiltiness case leslie crosbie double turn , she adultery also criminal . these conditions , her nasty distorted behavior becomes her genuine femme fatale , who not only evades human justice , but besides forgiven her husband , despite her bitter statement . but strange forces fate absence punishment decides intervene ; you may consider self destruction ' act , once you mocked human codes rules game decide burn your own bridges . thoughtfully realized , this bitter ( why not ? ) melodramatic picture sent immortality thanks memorable script , but always supported secure hand william wyler majestic always imitated but never equaled bette davis one her moist reminded films together little foxes jezebel .	1
i love disaster movies , or any disaster movie involves water - titanic , hard rain , titanic , pearl harbour , titanic ... yeah i love titanic . but i shocked when watching this film how much titanic resembles it ! there lot where you see where james cameron might got some his ideas . i felt very claustrophobic watching this film , not only we watching it darkness , but there also fireworks going off outside , film itself very claustrophobic . there no natural light , boat capsized . i awful time recognising actors this , particularly gene hackman . i knew name , i could not pick out which one he . ( very blonde moment there . ) i eventually recognised him , cos he main character ( big clue there ) , he also using simon cowell fashion sense - high waisted trousers , polo neck tucked . i don't know why it took me so long recognise him , but i managed recognise ernest borgnine , who played rogo , little house prairie , one or two episodes . poseidon adventure really good film , no need special effects or cgi , apart odd one or two . nearly all stunts performed actors themselves , when possible , they would ended up many bumps . what made this film all more better lack special effects , it made it all more real . i holding my breath during many scenes - which quite difficult considering i blocked up cold time - because it so claustrophobic , it made it all more worse . poseidon adventure definitely up there one my favourite disaster movies now , i really look forward seeing sequel , ' remake ' . i just discovered looking imdb , red buttons ( what strange name ) also little house prairie , two episodes	-1

i find it difficult feel strongly this film one way or other because there just isn't much there . newcomer rich kid james spader moves new town , pretends he rebel quickly makes enemies local high school hoodlums . too darn smart his own good , he falls lead hoodlum best girl . lo behold , she dreams better life likes him right back , but too afraid lead hoodlum trade up . yawn . spader faux bad boy act wears thin very quickly cheese oozes rather heavily , though kim richards ( aka paris hilton aunt ) awfully cute offers film only redeeming value . whether or not one watches depends one desire see kim .	-1

this film where you cannot help but fall love jeremy northam . he absolutely magnetic . he doesn't even come screen til 47 minutes into it , but he one who heart film . soul film imperative right . need right more important than son oxford education , daughter marriage , mother comfort . it beautifully acted , written nuanced film . one glaring detraction film * itchiness pidgeon character . i don't care how reserved english supposed , i don't think her character meant so mean , cold just plain soul-less . fortunately , every other character makes up her lack , thus 5 star rating . which tells you how strong other elements , especially northam	1

these two movies disney classics , especially first one , " escape witch mountain " - i saw this movie back when i kid it one my favorite movies ( still ) . it follows story two orphans named tia tony who extraordinary powers . not knowing where they came , they set out following map only belonging they ever owned- tia starcase . way there several men after them , one which ruthless man out use them their powers his twisted advantage . second movie , " return witch mountain " weaker than first , but still worth watch . tia tony much older this one , but much more comfortable their own skin because they know who they where they came . tony kidnapped brainwashed/controlled ruthless scientist who commands him use his power while tia gets help local street gang full delinquents save him . movies loosely based novel alexander key which also titled " escape witch mountain . " i recently found out he also wrote " return witch mountain " but i haven't chance read it ye t.t he first novel worth read but very different movies . example , tia mute not speak . she communicates tony telepathically . they also older book than they movie . orphanage they go beginning movie more so juvenile delinquents book filled bullies pretty mean caretaker . if you liked these movies , i recommend checking ebay books!i'd give " escape witch mountain " 5 stars " return witch mountain " 4 . they both classics	1
out three john waters films i've seen ( pink flamingos , serial mom , this film ... order ) , this definitely my favorite . it probably waters most normal film ( even this film some weird moments ); it got great cast , dialogue funny , some events play like some weird farce real life . edward furlong ( terminator 2 ) plays pecker , young kid who snaps pictures everything around him . graffiti'd walls , fat women , girls bus , man getting his hat stolen , pubic hair ... you name it , he takes picture it . eventually pecker photos get noticed rorey ( lili taylor , ' i shot andy warhol ' ) who puts his photos gallery mass acclaim . eventually , it takes toll pecker life everything spirals out control ... typical john waters fashion . movie plot pretty simple , but it hilarious . example ; pecker sister crissy sugar crazed brat . child protective services worker shows up house prescribes rittalin , which instantly changes her behavior . way i'm explaining it doesn't sound very funny all , but if you've any experience adhd ... then you'll get laugh out . christina ricci co-stars shelley , pecker girlfriend who runs fascist laundromat . i've always liked ricci actress , but her looks kind come go films . she'll look great one film then like crap . movie " ice storm " which came out around same time this , she didn't look great . here , she looks awesome . really hot she adds some fresh bits sarcasm film well . am i only one who thinks waters could've splurged nude scene here . anyway , all waters films , this movie not enjoyed everybody . however , this film different style then other two films i've mentioned ... so even if you no idea who waters , this movie isn't something you run tell your friends ( pink flamingos anybody ? ) . it damn funny , entertaining , witty . grade : a-	1

my opinion , this portrays metallica light i never expected , one shines beyond any other performance i ever seen , or heard , theirs . when i purchased cd this concert , i thought nothing beyond fact it great album . one my favorites . this dvd shocked me , very positive way . i not expect too much when i purchased this dvd , except it would visual version album . when i put it my dvd player , sat there watching concert , i amazed how well music performed . they their metallica crunch , they awesome orchestra backing them up ( course , greatest rock composer all time ) , james fantastic job singing this concert . i yet hear them perform this well . concert surprisngly laid back , but music pumps it up rocketing levels . truly spectacular concert . job well . think nothing it . just buy it enjoy it . =) you glad you	1

i first saw this movie high school french class back 70s . can't say i remembered much it except famous song image ( though not contents ) final gas station scene . course , our french teacher probably didn't let us see subtitles , so i'm guessing i really didn't understand most it anyway . got it lark recently watch again found it very touching , beautifully filmed , if tad melodramatic . coincidence , i watched " young girls rochefort " while back , made same director also starring deneuve . actually , i think i preferred " rochefort , " but both worth watching . simple story told straight-forward way , fact masked all dialogue sung . ending not what you expect , really , both characters appearing colder harder than typical romance might them . still , movie better because this , more moving realistic . each scene lovingly gorgeously put together , so its feast eyes . ears --- not so much . i found women voices harsh times , hitting high piercing notes grated . still , score pleasant -- though it may overused bi t--t he famous song joy hear	-1

i say all ggw videos i own ( 45-50 ) , this most disappointing since snoop dogg garbage couple years ago . only reason i give it two stars girls this one some prettiest so far . downsides numerous ; " hosts " take up far too much space this disk . let face it , we don't buy these dvds because we want hear unfunny guys interviewing drunk college kids . example : " hey , you fun spring break ? " well , she ninteen , drunk , beach mexico without parental supervision . i don't think it possible she couldn't good time . i don't need some guy asking banal questions airhead her boyfriend five minutes , when all i really bought dvd see her boobies ! ( btw-we never get see them ) . my second complaint whole dvd seems edited cable . title " spring break 2005 uncensored , " but this absolutely not true . i said before , girls this video stunningly beautiful . hats off crew rounding up truly fine selection gorgeous , uninhibited talent . but scenes shot hotel rooms ( 3x girl-girl , one solo bathtub ) , camera cuts away fades out just before you see any real action . if you've ever seen playboy soft-core stuff , you know exactly what i'm talking . i only hope unedited material finds it way video eventually , but i feeling it won't . here why : my third complaint whole dvd seems one long info-mercial [ ... ] . several times during video , ggw web address pops up screen , usually after disappointingly edited segments mentioned above . apparently , if you want see whole scene , you become member ggw website . plus , last ten minutes dvd just late-night commercials ( censored , boot ) they show tv . after all money they scammed me when i ordered dvds directly , i won't even buy their products new anymore . all-in-all , i'm extremely disappointed this dvd . if spring break 2005 uncensored dvd format ggw plans follow future , i'll never buy their products again	-1

" happiness " movie basically irony everything movie ironic ... including title . no one this movie happy , not even characters who think they . once movie over , you probably won't overwhelmed happiness either . this not happy movie ... although it pretty funny , sick demented way . but i think review cover sums up film nicely ; " deeply disturbing shockingly funny . " this movie some most disturbing sometimes disgusting scenes i've seen movie long time . movie centers around three sisters ; joy ( jane adams ) , helen ( lara flynn boyle ) , trish ( cynthia stevenson ) jordan . although almost all characters film kind circle back these three sisters , they're not really main characters . movie opens joy dinner date man named andy ( jon lovitz ) . andy looks distraught joy tells him it not going work out . what i think one funniest awkward scenes movie i've seen recently , adam gives her limited edition goldplated ashtray then takes it away tells her he saving it girl who truly loves him . credit sequence promptly follows . then we suddenly meet man named allen ( oscar winner philip seymour hoffman ) who explains his therapist bill maplewood ( dylan baker , ' head state ' ) he sexual fantasties his next door neighbor , who just happens helen . bill also happens married trish . ironic . allen begins series calls helen , telling her graphic detail what he thinks her before more irony begins pouring . meanwhile , we learn it seems trish only happy one this trio sisters ... she seems perfect life ; three kids good husband . but bill hiding something well , perverted fascination little boys . really disturbing scenes become this fascination . there also subplot sister parents ( louise lasser ben gazzarra ) who splitting up ; camryn manheim ( former abc tv show ' apprentice ' ) who plays neighbor allen who also hiding secret . now , i expected love " happiness " some reason ; even though i knew hardly anything plot . but , i didn't love ... i liked it , but i didn't love it . it very unique movie it definitely funny ; but i thought most interesting aspect movie one you see least . allen , played so well hoffman , could've subject his own film . don't get me wrong , i don't think they should've gotten rid rest story but i think they should payed more attention this character . besides story , there other good things it . dialogue very smart there some classic lines this movie . conversations bill his son very creepy though . case , this hasn't made clear . this movie not everybody ; many people may find it sick immoral , especially since it seems nothing really bad happens bill despite his wrongdoings . but filmbuffs appreciate it , but mature audiences must . grade : b+	-1

i love movie very much ! customes , monuments , dances songs , perfomances , everythings looks gorgeous lavish this movie but why dvd released under eros ? i thought it released under yashraj banner . devdas very beautiful movie but disc stink ! most stupid thing disc 2 which contained endless trailer . making also so so . there no interview other crew no photo gallery . there nothing much i've expected . producer or director shouldn't let movie release eros . devdas best example indian movie but releasing under eros makes movie spoiled ! 5 star movie but disc , 0 star	-1

sure this dvd set great nostalgia value anyone who grew up 60s early 70s , but it also just plain great entertainment . great actors , characters writing made up hawaii five-0 series , there no need rely " shock " or " viewer discretion " warnings like lot today overwrought television dramas . nobody played " tough cop " better than jack lord steve mcgarrett consummate tough cop character . it great watching him order around danny , kono chin , who invariably dig up important information case , but ultimately it mcgarrett who figures it all out . lot reviewers already commented great opening theme song ( this definitely one tv dvd where you not skip intro ) , but closing credits just compelling closeup blue flashing light top police car it speeds through honolulu street night . great stuff . highly recommended	1
when i first watched this movie i little dispointed my high hopes . but then i watched it more friends we started quoting it our everyday lives , it became hilarious . this movie kind movie funnier quote or watch friends than it watch alone .	-1
unsettling draining look into horrors fascist territorial ideas breed out masculinity , 1971 film " straw dogs " emotionally peeling viewing bring your own viewpoints surface . film garners high proverb messed-up western , character study , thriller , war film , action movie , social analysis , art house film rolled into one ; while its philosophies show its perceived messages absolute : yet , one may see gray area those apparent viewpoints , ones speculated , rest bring viewers own real life feelings into light context film . all these subtexts inside straw dogs presented mature , non-exploitive way , piling dimension its unique central characters , without giving definite feeling sympathy . plot concerns nighttime assault group ruffians pastoral home which man suspected killing girl staying . owners house , david amy , played dustin hoffman susan george , then find way fight back survive night . some may see straw dogs feminist film , way stereotypical male hormonal aggression concepts set forth initial two acts film , further acknowledged violent bloody testosterone set pieces final " showdown . " yet , there no female or male character connect typical cinematic way them " purely likeable . " audience rather connect characters david amy more because they only marginal likeable characters film , we agree many their actions , even if its often form self-serving , or if rest film depicts them unsympathetic cowards . this because humanistic side audience not want any more violence committed any character film , because its not " cool violence , " rather it brutal , nihilistic . these medieval concepts shown david ascent into " man " protecting his territory . this poetic way ultimate truth over " peace-and-love " beliefs time ; while amy , despite some childish antics young boys , many ways man relationship , before going callow most final siege scene . yet , when time comes her pick up sword -- so speak -- she obliges . yet , this absolute truth , also definite , antisocial reaction way there not one glimmer decency seem left all those who survive -- rather they go off into their own respective roles " man " " woman " without sense direction future . final often written two dialogue lines show this , they : henry niles -- " i don't know my way home .

" it this dialogue exchange shows way rest cast either one-noted stock characters , or neanderthalistic sexual and/or violent fix-seekers ; there no sense valediction any these " animals .

only 20 minutes long , this aptly titled film left me simultaneously dumbfounded awe . alone , sitting his rundown car parked desert christmas eve , stephen baldwin character , sweating , swigs bottle , puts gun his chin , yet he stops short . nearby , also alone , elderly woman prepares suicidal brew her kitchen . that all i'll reveal storyline , though , part beauty this movie seeing how its pieces come together . midnight clear huge things ( existence , relationship ) small ( smile , song) -- same time , even hugeness small . it heavy , yet full hope . movie brevity thought-provoking aspects make it ideal discussion-starter small group or get together , although before talking starts prepare found speechless ponderous wow moment . baldwin performance , way , mesmerizing	1

following arthur penn 1967 hit `bonnie clyde , ' hollywood enjoyed brief fling depression-era gangsters . free-wheeling woodstock generation found something like anti-establishment , anti-authoritarian , legendary outlaws their parents ' youth . legendary bank robber john dillinger certainly fit bill . john milius dillinger we meet title character , played warren oates , height his career . john dillinger notorious character enough wit recognize he doing rubes favor , sorts , every time he holds up bank . it gives those robbed something talk remember . anyway , dillinger seemingly relies efficient professionalism over firepower . least he don't shoot lessen he shot , which sight better than gun happy thug baby face nelson ( richard dreyfuss , ) who joins gang mid-movie . , such things measured back then , probably better than what we get dillinger hunting alpha g-man melvin purvis ( ben johnson ) . we get awful lot purvis this movie - he supplies periodic voice over narration gets equal screen time oates . milius would write teleplay 1974 `melvin purvis , g-man , ' which starred gruff voiced character action , dale robertson . parallel story telling works well enough , although dillinger gets lost time or two . we get tag purvis few times when he big showdown public enemies , they're very well handled . depression , which figured prominently social setting explanation do-badders , set deep background isn't much factor . dillinger , he tells his girlfriend/common law wife billie frechette ( michelle phillips , her debut , ) just always wanted bank robber , . towards end story fall apart bit . dillinger disappears completely last act , which dominated purvis negotiations lady red ( cloris leachman anna sage , madam who arranged dillinger capture outside movie house chicago . ) besides john dillinger , milius either scripted , directed , or both movies geronimo , teddy roosevelt , jeremiah johnson judge roy bean . legendary americans all , milius very much `print legend ' director . sometimes you get feeling if it doesn't lend itself photo op milius isn't much interested it . it makes good action flicks , shaky history lessons , frustration those who like character development . johnson ( good actor ) oates ( very good actor ) make their characters more compelling than written . after big shootout ( excitingly recreated movie ) his flight chicago dillinger life kind fell apart . he'd separated billie underwent plastic surgery . perhaps because he thought plastic surgery might confuse audience - perhaps - milius decided ignore dillinger chicago , save purvis plot capture him . heck , i would happy whole movie , starring oates , course , dillinger chicago . probably best suited gangster movie fans , or fans ben johnson warren oates .	-1

my experience , seeing words " national lampoon " any film title bad omen , indicating tastelessness dearth actual comedy up ahead . national lampoon gold diggers manages take series all-time low - which , sadly , no mean feat . friedle chris owen act if they auditioning future installment dumb dumber , plot suffers definite " ick " factor - , sadly , those actually movie strengths . calvin ( friedle ) leonard ( owen ) grew up together orphanage now trying make their mark world young adults . they certainly don't want work living , so they take up life petty crime . they pitiful failures this wind up jail . then , two old ladies they accosted street bail them out invite them visit their impressive home . guys ( which i mean calvin , he only one really capable actual human thought ) think their hosts rich , so it they devise plan marry them , wait their imminent deaths , then live large their inheritances . doris ( louise lasser ) betty mundt ( renee taylor ) may heirs mundt prophylactics fortune , but they fact cash poor ( thanks their insane uncle , who charge mundt estate ) . they make their own plans marry two young men , purchase sizable insurance policies them , then kill them . double wedding takes place , marriages consummated ( i hear yuck !? ) , month passes . calvin finds married life buxom , not-dead-yet doris driving him insane , so he leonard begin setting " accidental " traps their wives ; naturally , women finalizing their own murder plans same time . mr. mrs. smith , this ain't - but goes without saying . i won't lie say i didn't laugh or smile time or two because i , but national lampoon gold diggers aims low - really low - cannot begin escape black hole stupidity upon which it built . i think i speak vast majority human beings when i say we just don't want see senior citizen women prancing around onscreen like victoria secret models . there crude then there national lampoon crude , gold diggers crude it gets . this film should all rights career killer anyone involved it - although nikki ziering may emerge relatively unscathed given fact her screen time severely limited	-1
just quick note emplore you watch series before you read books !!! this fashion you get enjoy them both much more . understandable reasons ( time financial constraints ) , " sharpe " film series away most marvelous battle scenes bernard cornwell so excellent bringing life his " sharpe " novels . however , characters plots still rich enough sustain fantastic screen adventure budget . mr sean bean , actour who plays title character , lot . his screen charisma enough downplay some questionable moves writer/directour/producer . example , i could not understand why lovely tragic sub-plot marriage officer sharpe teresa , fiery spanish partisan impoverished noble family , abandoned favour stories such absurd " nun romance " plot " sharpe sword " . this decission aside , there enough " good stuff " left make this film linger my thoughts many days after first viewing . final test film well . enjoy !

ivan reitman 1984 mega-hit , it lesser sequel , both included this double feature dvd gift set long time fans ghostbusters should consider absolute must own . chances you already know story : three bumbling scientists ( bill murray , dan aykroyd , harold ramis ) lose their campus jobs go into business themselves . only thing , their business involves capturing containing gross slimy ghosts throughout new york . also featuring sigourney weaver , ernie hudson , rick moranis ; ghostbusters ended up super hit which spawned animated series , tons toys , sequel five years later . ghostbusters 2 , while nowhere near wonderful first film but still pretty fun , finds guys back business new breed evil birthed time new years . although this isn't first time both films appeared dvd , there enough special features here make this gift set worth picking up . there nice selection deleted scenes ( nothing substancial ) , couple featurettes , commentary reitman co ., but there no features devoted ghostbusters 2 . instead , there two animated episodes linked two films , there exclusive scrap book included too nice variety information fans . if you've already double dipped ghostbusters dvd , picking this up entirely up you . however , if you're fan these films don't own them dvd , pick this affordable gift set up enjoy	1

this movie might perfect example how audiences react more " famous " names more " superficial " " commercial " movies ... this movie unfortunate come out nearly same time more popular " dangerous liasons " featuring more stars ... i've seen movie many times television , i admit it good entertainment , but it never really made me crazy . , personally , stars doesn't mean great actors , most cases ... not long ago valmont shown television , both read book seen two movie versions it ( " dangerous liaisons " old french version jeanne moreau ) i very curious see what this one would offer ... me , i've never seen better valmont or better marquise ... whole cast great . that what i call good acting directing ... i haven't seen all colin firth movies , but i definetely say it must one his best performances ever ... watching him act valmont simple delicious ! comparing not always good thing , but this movie more luxurious more " serious " than " dangerous liaisons " great acting adds great result ; much classier version . if one seduced some aging not-so-attractive malkovich close , well , each his own taste ... i don't consider pfeiffer thurman great actresses . i'm sure i won't able convince everyone valmont much more subtle full-of-finesse performances , even though it not perfect copy book , it closest spirit meaning . worth your time !	1
" daughters dust " truly cinematic feast eyes , one savored slowly , metaphorically taking sips it if it bottle some elegant vintage wine . those expecting fast-paced narrative drama most surely disappointed , since film slowly takes us through final days gullah family life sea islands north carolina georgia , shortly before most family treks north new , promised life bereft time-honored gullah traditions . filmmaker - screenwriter - julie dash rendered beguiling look peazant family past present , seen through eyes matriarch nana peazant ( cora lee day extremely rich , intense performance , that truly one best ensemble cast fine performances . ) . there ample attention paid african folk wisdom culture , demonstrating rich cultural heritage sea islands ' gullah people , peazant family ponders its future one final family gathering . cinematographer arthur jafa camera recorded this saga visually sumptuous imagery sincerely respectful gullah traditions affectionately pays homage them . dash wonderful film must surely rank one most intriguing cinematic debuts american cinema , hopefully pointing way new generation afro-american filmmakers others interested her unique , almost existentalist , means cinematic storytelling ( i might add too i pleasure hearing ms. dash discuss her film here new york city few days ago ; it delightful , inspiring discussion which both emotionally intellectually quite rewarding . i might add too , i pleasure speaking her afterwards , discovering we mutual admirers splendid fiction octavia butler , whose unexpected passing last year deprived both afro-american literature literary science fiction one their most thoughtful , eloquent voices . )	1

i don't know how ride motorcycle ( i'm car guy ) . i've never watched motogp tv . i can't tell honda yamaha if placed front me . yet , i simply totally captivated this dvd . i admit i enjoy ewan mcgregor movies , i especially enjoyed ' long way round ' . this guy who seemed know what he doing , so it basis this ( my rather bored one day ) i bought this dvd . i didn't know what expect . but i tell you now : it better than anything i could imagined . basically , this documentary following people events during two seasons motogp . cast characters colorful . there rock-star-like veteran , meteoric challenger , likeable everyman plagued bad luck , young rookie , mad doctor looking after whole flock . documentary takes sympathetic look these guys , charting their ups downs over 2 tumultuous seasons furious racing pain-staking preparations . battles them track riveting dramatic . full dirty tricks , bitter mindgames , hot-blooded racing multiple overtaking maneuvers . think all racing movies you've ever watched ( le mans , days thunder , driven etc etc ) - this beats them all wide margin terms drama tension ... it all real life ! after this , you'll probably never thrilled f1 , indy , nascar or any race 4 wheels ever again - where you'll lucky get one breath-taking overtaking move per race , not several per lap motogp . this documentary really remarkable access all big stars sport . heroes , prima-donnas , hotshot rookies all open themselves camera . they all turn out charismatic , genuine ' human ' individuals . any movie screenplay would struggle depict characters instantly sympathetic this bunch bikers . you simply cannot imagine schumacher , alonso co formula 1 doing dvd like this - where you viewer get up close ride them . magic . only thing comparable my experience would ' metallica : some kind monster ' documentary - terms close , personal access mega-stars film-makers . race footage brilliant , matched decent soundtrack . watching races ( albeit highlights only ) enough get pulse rate up . film-makers good job keeping pace film running just right . thrash-speed races intercut well more introspective looks invidual riders . nice job . dvd offers good extras . ability follow key laps key races any one key riders interesting touch . it allows viewer see exactly how race won or lost perspective each protagonist . but best extra all ' sequel ' documentary , following riders next two seasons . after exhilirating film like this , you don't want it just end like - you keep wanting know what happens next . me , that mark successful film . well , you see i liked this film . watching it not spurred me get motorbike licence ( i still prefer my turbo 4wd car ) , but it excited me enough i'll tuning motogp this season . you don't bike fan enjoy this dvd ( i wasn't ) . i would recommend it anyone who : - enjoys real-life drama ( actually melodrama ! ) - enjoys good documentary film-making - or simply bit ' speed ' their bloo	1
