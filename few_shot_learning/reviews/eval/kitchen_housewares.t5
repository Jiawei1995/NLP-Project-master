i picked up dozen home depot less than $5 . same concept , just lot cheaper ! two them holding huge heavy shelf my kitchen . hole they make depends upon weight what they're holding . i'm sure it pinhole sized if you're hanging something weighs few ounces ( which case , you don't need this - use pushpin ! )the holes shelf bigger than pin-sized , but it heavy shelf . hole still way smaller than hole i'd make using any kind hook would hold such heavy shelf . it also takes little practice figure out where hang hooks ( drop hook below where you might want thing actually hang . ) this small detail , but if you need two these things you don't it right , your object gonna crooked . but bright side , you won't huge hole patch when you redo it ! recommended product ( but look around knockoffs .	1
kitchenaid kfpw760 exactly advertised . it three nested work bowls . inner , smallest one takes special blade ( smaller version standard processor blade ) . it perfect pulverizing/mixing small quantities things . pulling used bowl out leaves next one ready use without stop clean something . same true next one until you reach largest , 12 cup bowl . number blades come well designed transparent strong storage box ( finally , way keep everything together ) . unit even fruit juicer accessory replaces bowl . it kind rotating hub ( two hub sizes included , one lemons larger one oranges , etc ) . while it seems work , it not convenient low cost dedicated version such black decker , but what heck , it worth trying . motor quiet you get real feeling professionalism when using it . first i disappointed there weren't any fancy front panel switch options , but after thinking it , you only need provided , off pulse . would i buy it again ? absolutely . would i buy it again amazon ? again , absolutely . transaction without difficulty shipment actually came earlier than promised	1
we owned other hoover steam cleaners . they terrific job but all ended up leaking . we purchased bissel returned it due soggy carpet . we bought hoover f5914-900 based reviews . i confident it wouldn't leak because reviews fact this made america . i confident it would better product hoover gotten their act together . we grandchildren 3 dogs so our carpets constantly under attack . i couldn't keep affording carpets professionally cleaned when i knew hoover could just good job . ok ... our hoover came . my husband put it together it leaked all over . i then re-read reviews few mentioned how important it read directions put it together exactly following them . then we already taken it repair center . after week they not touched it . my husband picked machine up brought it home . we decided start square one put it together again . he , following directions letter . lo behold ... no leaks !!!!! yeah ! my carpets beautifully clean i am very happy woman . so ... moral this story always read directions first	1
after reading every review deep fryers i could find , i finally decided this one . it great i couldn't ask anything better or more easy use . i put it my cooktop let my big hood suck away any odors . it heats up quickly food always come out great . we made donuts after cooking shrimp halibut no cross-odors or tastes ! my family only tolerates fish , so this greatly appreciated . cleanup easy also . after waiting oil cool , pan , lid rack go into dishwasher . only heating element cleaned hand it quite easy . oil used many times without problems so it more economical use than i originally thought it would . i would recommend this no caveats	1
i used this vacuum only carpet , i bought it my finished basement . suction very powerful , it quiet , dirt cup so easy empty . cup designed so you push lever , it empties bottom - very clever so easy clean . it large dirt cup so it holds lot . other nice features include very long cord , great looks ! most important thing suction , this baby powerful !! it amazing what this thing picks up . overall , extremely pleased this vacuum !	1
i've through four these expensive units . they work great my great pyrenees dog . least they work awhile . then i end up trying figure out if batteries dead , then if new batteries i put dead begin , then i send it back repair . once i got back unit worked again - awhile . then i got back unit never worked again . i stopped sending my broken units after . so - desperation , impending poverty , i switched shock collar ; it either or what my breeder calls " blue juice special " . it also worked - yes , i tried it myself decided it wasn't cruel all . but punchline this : shock collars broke same rate citronella collar . least they cheaper , so i didn't lose much money	-1
i set it up my dogs because they bark whenever they hear noise or if someone rings bell , i 3 dogs , i put it they went beserk , they started going after each other , i didn't hear anything myself , but i am quite sure dogs , like i said they acted very badly towards each other , tone must made them lash out like . i cannot use it anymore .	-1
it appears viatek product ( bark stop pro ) related lentek design ( pc16 ; asin : b0002q89o6 ) - they based common design lentek engineer . i used ( tried ) viatek bark stop pro it definitely not work . my experience same reviewer lentek pc16 who noted unit only works " audible " setting - dogs least perk up their ears high pitch tone ; they completely ignore whatever emitted " ultrasonic " setting . furthermore , it often activated extraneous noises like birds , banging doors , wind noise , etc . this really poor functionality due either poor design or poor construction / quality . i've tried two different units they both not work . negative reenforcement concept could work if only these devices tuned noise environment could filter out all except actual barks .	-1
neighbor yapping mutt barks night day ... since police won't anything it , i bought this bark free ... hahaha ... what joke ... darn dog barked more ... anyway ... it zero my problem i consider it waste money ...	-1
i baked six loaves this machine . i using various bread machines past 12 years feel comfortable making adjustments when things don't turn out just right . my big complaint this machine low baking temperatures . even darkest crust setting longest baking time ( 70 minutes ) , my loaves only marginally acceptable - they not sufficiently baked . i using nearly-whole wheat recipe . machine quiet , strong , lot bells whistles , but only partially baked bread , i return it amazon . amazon shipped it me very poorly packed box which gaping open when it arrived , but they included return labels which made it cinch send back , quick enough refund	-1
sometimes it sprays when she barks , most time it doesn't . so i would say its effectiveness rather low . it not battery or fill level - maybe it just depends dog . i bark into it myself it sprays just fine . ( my children found this amusing .	-1
design using dc adapter led booklight extremely poor . it possible i missed warning tells you remove batteries before using dc adapter . but , it must not very big . i combined two ended up batteries leaked all over inside battery case . these brand new batteries . there not seem anything protecting batteries dc adapter so power goes right into them . this bad . modern devices expected work either battery or adapter without remove batteries . i assumed i could leave batteries so when i home i could use adapter , but traveling i would use batteries . don't make this mistake	-1
somewhat insomniac i read well into hours night book light essential me . i therefore purchased itty bitty booklight . if you use this light it essential purchase power supply two reasons . firstly , there no auto shut-off so if you fall asleep reading your batteries wear down very quickly . secondly , when using batteries , they start dimming rather quickly making it hard eyes difficult read resulting constant need new batteries . this light also extremely fragile . over couple years i went through 7 these ! i would not recommend this light - amount you spend never-ending purchasing batteries or expensive power supply , constant new purchases after it breaks , you might well splurge buy decent book light . i now tri lite capstone enterprises ( available barnes nobel - come get it stock amazon ! ) it terrific ! it clock alarm timer . you set it stay any period time once it reaches time light flashes . time you extend minutes . if you don't so , example you're sleeping , it automatically shut off . it also produces much more light much brighter than itty bitty book light	-1
i two cats both less than 5 months old . i bought citikitty training kit hoping it would save me scooping litter box . it turned out piece flimsy junk that way over priced . my cats would rather their business anywhere but this piece plastic . save your money use it something more useful	-1

i bought this hoping wow my family some 30 minute meals but this doesn't work great my electric stove . if you leave it up too high longer than minute grill side griddle coating burns off stinks up place . if you can't leave it up high you don't get good grill marks . i end up putting high few minutes then back down . doesn't cook thick meat chicken breast through well . you better off finishing them real pan oven . coating chips easily . i am thinking going cast iron it more work begining but i think it worth it long run	-1
it looked okay when i opened it . then i washed it before using my washer dryer full " cranberry " colored lint ( wet washer dry dryer ) . next time i washed it better but , still some lint washer normal dryer . it not warm enough alone . it might okay warmer months but , not what i expected winter	-1

i bought 4 these light sets after seeing them real simple magazine . i thought they looked seemed perfect option my kitchen ...... wrong ! after only 15 minutes , my brand new batteries ( 4 aa ) seemed fade , within hour ..... dead . i thought this mistake , bought new batteries again , only upset when same thing happened ! i called manufacture getting adapter 4.8 it requires ..... only told they not sell public i would track it down radio shack , etc . well , i no luck yet ..... lots 4.5 , but no 4.8 . i wish i could send these back . they complete waste , if i ever find proper adapters , i certainly use them . but defeats purpose me choosing wireless lighting , doesn't it	-1

i purchased this item , after read " banneton " book " rustic european breads your bread machine " . picture clearly shows 4 baskets , description vague - but you only get one . basket you get quite small , all but smallest loaves would quickly overflow basket . it looks sturdy well made . it would good value four baskets - it too much pay single basket . i didn't actually use it , choosing instead return it , so i can't comment how well it worked ..	-1
this grater fine when you get it work , but most often handle doesn't screw correctly you can't get it . it mostly waste time , though concept great one . i'd recommend trying maybe stainless steel one instead this plastic one	-1

if i could give this product 0 stars , i would . read negative reviews , folks , forewarned . i believed positive reviews ignored negative ones , much my exasperation . when i plugged my handsome new oven , little red digital display numbers came right away ... hmmm ... so far so good . but , according instructions , you supposed run oven door open 15 minutes get rid new oven smell . sooo ... owner manual says push " bake " button dashboard , which turn lights pilot lid light display , after which you set " time " " temp " . so i push " bake " button nothing happens , no lid light comes . nothing . zilch . zippo . so i then push " temp " " time " lights try get gerbils wake up . still nothing . i unplugged it plugged it again , thinking maybe somehow i screwed up , while listening " beep " owner manual said should happen whence unit plugged . zilch . zippo . nothing . no " beep " . no " bake " lid light . tried pusing " temp " " time " buttons again . nada . tried unpugging it again doing whole shebang all over again . still nothing . it just sat there grinned me . this time , i figured out my unit also " dead arrival " . least you get parcel paid bill lading printed off amazon website defective product return , saving yourself annoyance prepaying return dead product you already paid now must wait weeks get refund . amazon should take remainder their stock this awful product out back lot their warehouse run them over forklift	-1

hoover past , i excited find this one this price . i've it only year am now vacuum shopping once again - not looking hoovers . parts plastic cheap break easily . it advertised power hand tool . it not . it works air when you put it any material it stops spinning . upright power tool carpets also stopped working after six months . hard wood floor tool worked fine - suction strong enough - but again plastic pieces break attachments don't stay like they should , so i spend most my time vacuum re-attaching pieces . i would recommend looking elsewhere if you want vacuum last	-1
we owned this machine little over two years . first 6 months it worked expected clothes coming out slightly damp due condensation method drying . however , since then , it stopped drying , such 5 hours drying ( yes , 5 hours ) yields wet clothes . this persisted , despite 4 repairs , replacing almost every part machine except control board , which i assume next . prior this machine we owned equator brand washer/dryer combo which disaster : broke after 3 years . unfortunately , lg probably best bunch mediocre machines ( equator , asko , maber other brands ) available us .. all shortcomings dryers all use ventless-condensation method which take much longer dry almost all 115v . bosch combos available europe , but unfortunately not available us , 220v thus , dry more quickly . this not machine family , but rather ideal apartment or condo 1 or 2 people most . when it worked , it worked well . however , no one should invest $1300 it break such short time . no one should spend over 5 hours 1 load laundry . if you must purchase one these machines ( reasons space ) , buy extended warranty	-1
we got this present high hopes actually use it microwave . it takes over 7 minutes warm something up forget making microwave popcorn it just doesn't pop kernals . overall lots features but it worst microwave i've ever owned	-1

i ordered this machine my wife after reading dozens reviews positive feedback . we followed instructions explicitly created one cup coffee . after machine said " ventilate " . we followed proceedures ventilating machine it seemed correct itself . went make cup coffee it said " ventilate " . this time it would not fix itself . i tried perform ventilate process it would simply spray hot water out into tray . turn off knob " ventilate " comes back up screen . turn machine off turn it back , " ventilate " came up screen . we called amazon they sent us replacement few days later ( thank you amazon ) . unfortunately , this one i not get cup one out machine . it read " ventilate " soon i turned it . difference this one no water would come out all . gaggia provides no customer support so you your own this unit	-1
none other nonsticks hold candle this stuff ! i bought this 8 " fry pan 2 months ago , except bottoms , still looks brand new despite used nearly every day . i even used bacon press ( cast iron ) it every time i cooked bacon couple times i accidently scraped inside side pan no marks left . hubby stacked knives forks inside , then topped it off 6 dinner plates . i thought it -- scratches nicks everywhere , but no , not single mark . my calphalon commercial nonstick ( which hit trash already ) looked like it through war when my 18 yr . old . i must admit , though , i not use metal utensils it , nor i put dishwasher since i won't one til kitchen remodeled . overall , though , just what abuse it gotten , i'm very impressed buy more . my advice ? don't mess rest -- buy best this it . going try wok next . wish they sold electric griddle this stuff it	1

cuts like samurai blade quality , doesn't need steel frequent henckels/ wusthof knives . it excellent weight medium sized hand . however , handles get quite slippery when wet , so keep your hands clean dry while using this knife safety . also , if you plan saving money getting cheaper steel , don't , because this global blade much harder than henckels/wusthof blades ; qood quality diamond coated or ceramic steel must , or if you really like steel design , get global steel which cost quite bit . overall , this good quality knife proper care attention needed , just like samurai would get use his sword	-1

some reviews make it sounds like every ec701 defective out box . so far , i've made 40 shots espresso 10 steamed ciders , i've very pleased product . i've working improving my technique now i think espresso excellent . i prefer my homemade shots stuff i buy starbucks most other cafes , though this could due delusional pride my own amateur baristaship . also , i may over-excited because i'd wanted espresso machine so long . negatives ( so far ) it looks like there fair amount ongoing maintenance cleaning machine , though i doubt this unique this brand . also , others mentioned , espresso spout low , so i drink my coffee out ceramic ramikins ( although aren't low spouts authentic ? ) . also , i haven't gotten steamer working quite right i always end up cappuccinos ( all foam ) even if i'm trying make latte . hopefully i'll get better time . reliability , i've only made 40 shots , so i can't speak long-term quality , but so far , so good . heck , 40 espresso drinks starbucks would've cost me over $120 now , although making it home still isn't free -- if you use convenient pods , it still 50 cents shot , illy beans expensive ( right now , i'm using unground dark-roasted kona , which deep very smooth )	-1
person who loathes cheap , clutter , infomercial widgets i bought this out or sheer curiosity imagining it would returned same day . this opener large , requires electric plug takes up counter space . but my surprise it works amazingly well . there foil cutter stored base . screw enters cleanly seems eliminate broken shredded corks which frustrating . hold button again cork emerges device drops out . i always liked my sturdy simple stainless steel opener . but this turned out keeper . it design contemporary clean , although it looks like it should something more profound than just pull cork . it also conversation piece provoking smiles guests . pleasant surprise , highly recommended especially so person who lacks hand or wrist strength .	1

i baught my 8 " global chef knife 5 years ago . it great use kitchen remains one my favorite knives market . molybdenum/vanadium steel global knives holds edge far longer than its henkles/wustolf counterparts . my only complaint handle design which not suit my gripping style , nor my large hands . i don't mind steel handles , although they contribute slippage some loss grip . my main problem tapered bolster , which almost lack bolster altogether . coupled thin spine heal knife , extended use uncomfortable hand . i highly recommend globals , but i might suggest 8 1/4 " heavyweight model , which appears more standard handle design less tapering bolster . more info knife handling care you might check out cia book titled " professional chef knife kit " . one last comment . although all knife companies like claim their knives dishwasher safe , please , please , don't put your knives dishwasher .	-1

so , espresso machine great . it solidly built very simple design it . i recommend this machine anyone who wants make espresso home would like their machine last more than couple years . it moderately priced -- moderate i mean kind high home system , but definitely not 12 thousand dollars -- it also pretty cool looking . which always bonus . issues i've few number , but i'll give some hints getting your new machine work your liking -- your liking i mean my liking . first , make sure thing stays clean . this especially important when it comes steaming milk . wand needs cleaned quickly , thoroughly , often . try clean machine every 2-3 weeks ( heavy use ) 4-6 weeks ( light use ) espresso machine cleaner . this make steaming milk much easier faster , since you've removed obstacles steam . second , making espresso takes some tinkering . usually , espresso coffee shop run around 140 degrees ( ) . machine , espresso set run around 80-100 degrees , while steaming milk set 140 degrees . simply set machine steam milk , load your shot , steam your milk , run your shot 140 degrees . start counting when espresso starts dropping 17-22 seconds . if you're not content rate or quantity , adjust espresso grind -- more coarse or fine -- increase or decrease rate sho t.t hird , this all aesthetic , but i find i get best espresso vienna or french roast coffee . personally , i love sumatran coffee , but costa rica , papua new guinea , ethiopia , kona ( hawai'i ) close seconds . buy fair trade organic coffee . then enjoy some wicked good espresso . happy coffee drinking ! --	1

okay , so it hard get excited things like hepa filters - or vacuum cleaners other devices they used . when my wife concluded her extensive search replacement our old canister vacuum anointed miele winner , i slightly less enthusiastic than she . it vacuum cleaner . it just tool keeping things trim . after very short while i began understand her admiration design build quality this particular tool . hepa filters bags used no less part this than vacuum itself . if you tire vacuums constantly gritty dust they stir-up but don't quite capture , get miele . if you distain smell emanating your vacuum exhaust , get miele . if you long simple , easy use maintain system even your husband use , get miele . use genuine miele bags , change your hepa filter recommended . difference cost minor , but you amazed difference results	1

i capresso just 2 years ( see my earlier rating . ) it worth it weight gold . coffee terrific .... i no desire stop starbucks way home work my usual evening caffiene fix . customer service terrific . last week steam knob stuck not turn open . since warranty period 1 year over , i concerned spend huge amount get it fixed . i tried cleaning knob(thinking maybe some milk splatters grunge crusted underneath ) , i also tried wd 40 ..... no avail . when i called customer service , i spoke ' gunther ' , who kindly walked me through prying off knob replacing it .... now it works perfectly ! machine operated my 10 12 year olds well my cleaning lady sitter ..... it never failed . reproducible cup coffee .... pretty much each time . rare occasion , coffee luke warm discarded . i learnt machines little nuances tweak settings make perfect cup . i always use whole beans . i found when i use ground coffee i put tremendous amount per cup brewed . i also only used non flavored coffee beans . frother get pretty crusted , so i usually take it apart soak it warm soapy water every other day . occasion , if it not reattached well it pop off while steaming make bit mess , possible scald you .... so careful . happened once or twice , probably why steam knob got stuck dried milk . any rate , jura capresso f7 gets 5 stars me 2 year mark	1
i what you're doing now , read these reviews . my perspective , this single greatest travel mug market . one reviewer mentioned it doesn't stay warm long enough , however my coffee/tea stays respectably warm least hour . usually more . there something truly satisfying tossing full travel mug coffee onto floor your car if you're hurry ... or placing it your backpack classes --- neeever worrying it spilling . pure genius ! my only complaint handle isn't conducive cupholder my mazda 6 . handle extends too far down which causes it get way my center console ... i only stabilize it cupholder if both cupholes empty . but since it leak proof , i no problem setting it seat next me	1

my entire kitchen kitchenaid . i bought this opener three years ago . it awful ... difficult use , shredded paper top can label , very difficult get started . because i love kitchenaid products so much , i assumed this just defective opener , threw it away , bought . second one even worse ! it worked okay first couple times , but now it barely cuts all . it grinds top , making dents , but won't actually make cut . once i get it started , i cannot finish it because it " messes up " pretty badly . this one going garbage well . :	-1
this product seemed like good idea . i mix my own cereal , add lots nuts seeds . so it lot heavier than fruit loops always shown pictures . way holder fits into base not all secure , when full heavy cereal , disaster assured . also , neither top or bottom cover really secure seal , so tipping holder caused top fly off me , some interesting times my dogs cleaning up floor . i hard time taking bottom seal off when my cereal bowl position . if you take it off first , then some cereal leaks out , causing problem i trying solve - namely no cereal laying around my counter inviting unwelcome guests . i tried this product awhile , but threw it trash pretty fast . went back big tupperware container not convenient this could , but no awful spills either	-1

spiegelau acquired riedel year or two ago , quite similar riedel vinum glassware , which sits just below riedel high end sommelier series . these glasses offer exceptional value . difference spiegelau riedel less quality any individual stems -- both well-made , european machine blown crystal -- than fact riedel offers broader range glassware specifically designed enhance wines particular varietals ( e.g. , cabernet sauvignon , pinot noir ) or particular appellations ( e.g. , burgundy , bordeaux ) . if you simply looking basic red wine glass basic white wine glass , spiegelau work just fine . however , if you usually just drink barolo , example , you might wish invest bit more money riedel stem specifically developed enhance bouquet flavors appellation . however , most important thing know these excellent quality glassware offer major advantages crystal over regular glass , thin lip microscopic pores glass effectively increase surface area , increasing area which bouquet launch .	1

let me describe my floors ... i turn 30 tomorrow . i'm bachelor dog cat . i'm also avid ( messy ) cook i bought hoover my kitchen . floor lightly textured vinyl . my main hobby brewing beer which tends leave lots sticky wort beer floor . side-effect lots drunken people parade through my kitchen which my bar bathroom . it also winter time i've putting sand salt mix walkways . summary , my floors disgusting !! i read instructions today work i couldn't wait get home try my floor mate . it assembled quickly easily . i used dry setting first it actually impressed me . i planning using my normal vacuum , but i too lazy get it out . it also lot quieter than my vacuum ( kenmore model)i set hoover up wet mode . it what it promised- it put down liquid , scrubbed , sucked it up . first , i didn't think it sucking up wetness much i would hoped ; but i rinsing out floor mate ( which quick easy ) , i turned around find 90% floor already bone dry . i cleaning out wet container- wow ! water jet black dirt . well , it taken me few minutes write this , so let me check results ... floor 99.99% dry immaculate ! it hasn't clean , since ... well , ever ! i one complaint- container you put solution could bigger . i ran out just before finishing kitchen ( it pretty small ) . luckily brushes wet enough finish job . i love my floor mate ! thank you hoover ! all writers bad reviews- i think you need read your manual .	1

buy something else . first all , it started out fine - good suction , etc . there only one flaw dusting wand didn't work . it supposed charge clean itself , but only happens if you keep thing together , i bet you can't . it doesn't take long power paw stop working . mine rotates so slowly if it touches anything it stops . cleaner itself loses suction over time . dust catcher easy empty , but don't forget buy all filters it needs . this poor choice	-1
i've wanted dyson long time , but me spending over $400 vacuum seemed little extreme . well , not anymore . i finally took plunge ordered dyson dc07 all floors last week ( . . penny ) . it arrived today it only took me ten minutes assemble it . i don't know what other posters referring when they say it complicated assemble . all i put hose together pull off few pieces tape . then i put dyson test . i 400 square foot apartment bathroom downstairs . most my apartment thick shag carpet except kitchen which tiled floor . bathroom floor cement thin pile carpet over top it . dyson handled it all without making sound . i've read reviews here say vacuum make terrible racket thick carpets it suck up lot carpet fiber . my dyson neither . i stairs leading down bathroom which also carpeted . i sat dyson downstairs bathroom ( per instructions which say put dyson lowest floor when vacuuming stairs ) i used floor/carpet attachment end wand stairs . not only i able vacuum entire stairs , but because length wand i able turn entire apparatus around vacuum risers well . this something i could never my former vacuum , least not very well . i bit worried using hose dyson quick pick ups dusting , because there other reviewers here who say suction diminishes when using hose and/or attachments . let me just say not case all . top my kitchen cabinets i old bottles , baskets , assorted antiques sitting up there since i moved four years ago . i only tried vacuuming up there couple occasions two vacuums i used failed miserably two regards - 1 ) their hoses could never reach , 2 ) they could not adequately remove dust ( which kind resembles grizzly bear fur ) . dyson excelled this task . i no problem reaching hose up there ( brush attachment ) one pass vacuum sucked up layers dust like finger scooping frosting off cake . length this hose stretch astounds me , i tell while using it it made extremely well last long time . gone days using cheap vacuums equally cheap hoses . hoo-rah ! now far emptying canister keeping it clean this not daunting task some claimed . i able remove canister dump dirt one simple move . also , if you gently tap side shroud while it over trash you dislodge lot dirt debris caught up inside it . i not taken dust bin assembly apart yet any thorough cleaning , but i reckon it no more difficult than cleaning out my sewing machine after every project . i found lot complaints here could rectified simply reading manual . it very detailed ( pictures even ) there even 800 number dyson support . all all i'm giving this vacuum five stars it stellar performance . it handled all cleaning tasks ease filters solid construction chassis hose i don't think i'll ever need buy vacuum again . my final word ; there should picture this vacuum next word phenomenal dictionary	1
my life , i used lot syrup dispensers , most which poorly designed leaked . this one neither . i really love way this dispenser works . top nicely designed executed out brushed stainless , gasket seals tightly . no-drip spout indeed no-drip us . even our 10 year old can't make it drip , that saying something . glass container larger than it looks since glass goes all way top handle , inside lid . my only wish they made one bit bigger could hold full bottle real maple syrup .	-1

just note , you get this book free when you sign up take wilton cake class course 1 ( least you michael arts crafts where i took mine ) book easy understand , pictures literally step step include instruction such " offhand , " meaning it tell you something should resemble ice cream cone or look like behive , swirl here , or lightly brush here , sweeping motion , etc . i found it very refreshing not all spoken terms only people who attended culinary school would understand . it also shows you pictures suggested supplies you need beginning book so your not running back store each time you start new segment . i would suggest just taking class because top getting book free , you get lot more tips advice instructor you jot down ample space imbetween pictures notes book . but if you too busy or there isn't class scheduled near you , this book would certainly suffice helping you get started	1
i gone through several deep fryers over past few years my quest find perfect deep fryer . t-fal fr7008002 ultimate ez clean hands down best i found date . pros : so easy clean ! most unit dishwasher safe , which great plus me . thing i hated deep fryers before cleaning oil system . either inner pot would not removable ( days when deep fryers first came out started become popular ) , or pot would full junk food it would hard pour out filter oil . also , where store oil ? this unit makes it so easy clean reuse oil . it great job filtering out junk floated into oil frying neatly storing it into storage container . it time someone came out product like this ! cons : it use lot oil , so you buy big gallons costco or warehouse type place . good thing , though , ease reusing oil , so it doesn't make it seem too bad use amount oil . also , i wish oil would heat higher than 378 degrees . i didn't get out cooking thermometer actually see if oil heated temp , but it would nice if oil got hotter . i understand it home use not professional , so there safety factor , but frying higher temperature fries ensures crispy-on-the-outside-and-tender-on-the-inside-not-oily fry . overall , i love this deep fryer , so i gave it five , even though it few things it could improve upon	1

we drinkwell fountain more than two years after recent birth our first child cross-country move , found we become overly lax giving it thorough cleaning . primary reason this cleaning very difficult -- it almost impossible get every little nook cranny . plus plastic drinkwell made out seemed get grungy very easily almost absorb minerals thanks hard water our new home . i little apprehensive catit fountain after reading few reviews , but thought we would give it try . first thing we noticed while assembling we really liked water filtered * before * it returns pump ( drinkwell , it filtered after going through pump , which leads gunkier pump ) . it also very quiet , so you don't get " running water " sound ( drinkwell ) occasionally led us search open tap before we realized it fountain . some people mentioned difficulty seating reservoir so water flows over dome properly . we experience this after cleaning fountain , but quickly discovered we just needed move pump bit one side allow secure fit . large reservoir , we also enjoy able go approximately week refills two thirsty cats , instead refilling daily ( we not purchase drinkwell optional reservoir ) . it also very easy see if water level getting low . one note : i haven't observed either cat actually licking water dome i sure our little female would love this since she drink faucet . overall , i like this fountain better . it looks kind cool , it takes up smaller footprint , quieter , easier fill easier clean than our old fountain . we not purchase mat , zero problems spilling or splashing . we give drinkwell fountain my sister-in-law since it still working order her kitty enjoying it thus far	1

i semi-skeptical this would work but i am sucker red kitchen items . i didn't actually buy this until i saw it person local kitchen store because i wasn't sure how it worked . you soften two sticks butter , put them into top part pot which like upside-down cup , then invert place bottom part . course you need little bit water bottom create seal keeps your butter fresh . then place anywhere unrefrigerated butter soft spreadable whenever you want it . no more hard butter toast ! realy important part change water every couple days -- i make it part my morning routine when i am kitchen making coffee -- takes only 5 seconds . your butter not stay fresh indefinetely , however . after month even fresh water i got some mold pot . pot nearly empty time what left fell out into water . not big deal since i typically go through all butter faster than month time , so i've only seen this happen once . after butter used up , i wash butter pot ( it dishwasher safe ) fill up again . wish i this years ago ! red great shade , it matches my cherry red le creuset poterie dishes nicely	1

starting positive : this thing well-made holds plenty whatever you intend put into it . very strong , it doesn't even begin show strain even while forcing through even toughest doughs . most my tubes fit fine , except smallest largest them . only real negative , outside fact it doesn't work all my tubes , fatty or oily things leak through canvas , i wind up hands covered grease can't grip anything properly . it would nice see plastic lining inside bag , which would prevented this problem . so , really , good product , but not good enough 5 stars	-1

i bought this item when i replace my microwave i hoping reduce ' microwave smell ' - funky tomato sauce smell blows out microwaves after too many spatters . you clean out microwave , but you can't clean behind vent grids , where splatters go live forever , pungent biomass . so i figured food would blow out vent hole cover splat roof my oven , but reduce problem . we use oven mostly reheating melting . this cover exceeded my expectations . 1 . it fits my tiny sharp r-209kk 800 watt oven - bit overhang but it never fallen off platter . 2 . no discernable splatters even roof my oven , which i wipe out every day ! steam vent ( not finger hole ) top releases pressure top where steam rises . even pyrex casseroles glass lids not good because pressure builds , lid lifts steam , they shoot hot liquid all directions . 3 . food cooks better . we used use paper towel , or dish cover food . here food cooks moist environment doesn't ' explode ' much because steam regulation clever top vent . paper towel would always slide off or sink into food cook into food let food blast out edges . 4 . cover doesn't get very dirty . i guess because food explodes less it easy clean dunking my dishpan rinsing . nothing baked onto this lid . 5 . food keeps better . if it cooking , i leave food microwave because lid keeps it drying out . 6 . it works great taller containers still fit under circle . i rubbermaid microwave containers 5 inchers tall 5x5 inches base . i set this lid top container . vent hole keeps contents blowing protects oven . hole top not finger hole . use pot holders remove anything microwave . defensive . it only takes one mishap land surprise burn . never assume spot safe touch . i note comments breakage . i wonder if dishwasher heat ? i find rigid plastic dishes cannot take hot water treatment without becoming brittle , often become opaque crack , so i am hand washing which easy because it hardly gets dirty . dunk , swipe , rinse . i saw cheap chinese imitations . i stick american made plastics food prep save job too . nordic ware great innovative companyand hey , if your food piled higher than cover you need something else .	1

this coffee maker just what i looking , but considerably more money i wanted spend coffee pot , after reading all reviews here amazon , i convienced go ahead pull trigger . all i really say $300 i really expected more . if i paid $30 walmart it , it would trash now , but after blowing half truck payment it i am stuck least trying make it work . first , grinder seems keep getting plugged up . while grinder runs alloted amount time , beans not fall hopper into grinder so less than enough beans end up ground into basket , you get watered down coffee . second , basket supposed swing over grinding station brewing station after grinding complete . it just doesn't enough spring power make trip stops just short which means hot brewed coffee split pot , counter . i am what i consider good consumer . i compare prices extent , but quality what i am after if i find good product , i spend $$ get best . i say i caught off gaurd this time . if i hadn't already discarded box packing i would sending it back . after rereading above reviews i must really doing something wrong . good luck	-1

i purchased this espresso maker 2-1/2 months ago . i used it 2-3 times per week . my first disappoinment frothing wand . not only it placed place which it difficult get mug milk or water cleaning without first sloshing some counter . second , shape style wand all frothing itself . if i wanted automatic frother i'd bought something cheaper . this allows no proper room style . someone who not operated professional barista this may fine , but i prefer more control over how much what type foam i create , thus i purchased " nicer machine " or so i thought . most part i am pleased espresso itself . i most often get healthy creme , when i don't i'm sure it operator error ( improper tamping or whatever ) . one week ago i made latte left run some errands . i returned find all my incoming outgoing mail sopping wet . perplexed i took good look around counter , noticed water carafe my espresso maker empty . i always fill it after making last latte remembered doing so before i left . i absolutely no idea how this managed get cracked . i called customer service delonghi requested replacement . i not asked many questions item shipped no charge , however - they tell me it won't arrive 5-8 weeks . meantime , i am only able put enough water tank make one latte . i thought this machine last me years , but now i am wondering how long it really hold out .	-1
preliminary review : i just used aeropress second time am very happy it . i've read reviews here [ ... ] effusive they , i one over-riding concern : would coffee too bland not strong enough ( slight bitter kick ) my taste ? i like coffee black strong ; always always . , good espresso heavenly . therefore all reviews how " smooth " aeropress coffee made me wary . i like touch bitterness distrusted . 170 degree recommended water temperature . anyways , espresso came out nice thick , very full-bodied rich . there also very nice combination enough acid heavy , rich taste experience . complexity some good beans came through , perhaps even enhanced over my good french press . i'm delighted . i'll come back expand when i've used this bit more , but now i highly recommend aeropress assure those who may similar concern hand-press won't deliver " real espresso " : it . one more word : there real crema if one firmly pumps down inch or two air top grounds . quality crema just so-so , ( light , no distinction ) but it there . professional espresso machine works 130psi ( 9-10 bars/atmospheres ) get crema everyone loves ; one thing , far i tell , only thing , out reach aeropress .	1
i purchased this specifically because i looking small spoon rest reviewer commented this could only hold tablespoon . i slightly dissapointed find this standard sized spoon holder easily holds mixing spoons , wisks , etc . only reason someone would difficulty using this intended if they weren't watching what they doing . large spatula only utensil may not rest snuggly holder ... though it could easily rest top you would most spoon holders . anyone looking holder accomidates any size or shape utensil should search using key word ' spoon rest ' - traditional spoon shaped holders , this also returns holders/rests tend wide flat so utensils placed anywhere it without much thought . this product also quite attractive looks much nicer than run-of-the-mill white ceramic , stainless steel , or country themed holders found most department stores .	-1
i've my electric skillet approximately 2 years . i love way it cooks easy cleanup . i only used it maximum 7 times when i noticed there spot seemed stuck surface pan . i looked more closely discovered there 2 " square area where nonstick coating just rubbed off . i always very careful way i handle this skillet ( no metal utensils , hand wash , no excessive heat . ) i bought it really good sale price , but i think i should able get more than 7 uses before it destroyed cooking surface	-1
this one my best christmas memories , making krumkake my mom . it take while since each cookie made individually . however , it totally worth wait . cookies crisp sweet . i would much rather make them using stove top method not new electric krumkake makers . i remember concentrating getting them just right amount ... my mom watching . we would listen christmas music talk we worked . i guess some memories should not messed	1
i really like this design . it slight raised lip running around outside edge which contains any batters , grease , or other liquids which might run over edge create mess ; grease drain only front edge treated same sturdy non-stick coating rest surface , making easy clean up . indeed , lack plastic attachments make cleanup easy , i really like simple design , very large cooking surface , two plastic handles removable plastic grease catch . only thing keeping me rating it five out five i would liked see thicker aluminum used , base only 2mm thick , though i've unable find anything thicke	-1

i see now it rated 250 degrees , though that not written package . first time i used it , handle got little too close flame my stove end melted . it still serviceable , so i more careful next time , but apparently cooking temperature omelette pan higher than 250 degrees entire leading edge melted my omelette my non-stick pan , half-ruining my very expensive all-clad pan , entirely ruining my omelette course oxo good grip turner . it may good grip , but it not good much else	-1

so others not make mistake i , i am writing this review . this cookware performed well two years . however , we large family put it dishwasher regularly . it 5 years this cookware not stood up regular use . not mistake kitchen essentials professional cookware . now when we cook mashed potatoes , we not know if potatoes peppered or just flaking teflon . all pieces used daily now un-coated aluminum . outside cookware chalky appearance . i am sure this dishwasher . we used plastic utensils most time , but you know how it when you hurry feed kids . my recommendation spend money high quality stainless steel cookware . we recently purchased calphalon tri-ply so far we really pleased . stainless steel cleans up easily , or least easy kitchen essentials . money , go stainless you never purchase cookware again .	-1

i bought this amazon.com right after holidays . i must say i leary after reading negative reviews . however , it one few push-down button toaster like our old black decker . when i received toaster i carefully thoroughly read through instructions . we burned toast first couple slices , but after we adjusted it good setting good results since then . i also baked some homemade fries it they came out fine . after looking stores numerous models , we turn black decker aside due very loud timer their models . too bad , because we liked their other features , but couldn't stand loud " neverland " ticking timer . we settled oster 6235 because smaller footprint , sleek style , i said before , separate toaster button . yes , it get hot top it should given space around it - any toaster oven should . if you read directions thoroughly before operating , remembering turn rack over toast ( it raises it slightly higher bottom burner element ) turn it back over other cooking you shouldn't any problems . like all toaster ovens , they aren't best toast . if you want great piece toast , buy toaster specific job . however , all-around type 2nd oven , this good job . just make sure you watch it carefully first few times use so you learn adjust its cooking habits . it not toy small children should not able reach it during operation .	-1

while not first come market powered scrubber[as seen tv]this scrubber much more solid feel than its competition without * too * hefty . it geared so there sufficient torque allow some serious scrubbing ability remove any remaining teflon your non-stick pot or pan . if you know difference pot or pan * , this gadget made just you . i would strongly suggest using rechargeable batteries rather then start cycle use refuse ameliorating long term impact environment your wallet[or purse ] . so why not five stars ? two reasons .... first , tired hospital color scheme just attractive today it 50 years ago . yech ! course , if you still any appliances bygone era , you remain completely coordinated satisfying even most severe case ocd . second , only two scrubbing pads ???? yes , they different grades " scratchless ? " , but including least one replacement set wouldn't send bd stock into downward spiral , would it ? i would strongly suggest ordering extra set pads [ no , unlike bd other scrubbers , these pads exclusive this model only ] your purchase . this product even remotely neccesary ? no ! but you know what they say woman her toys . . . er . . . d'oh!i've got this sinking feeling couple months i'll writing review new porter-cable " power sponge " , men finally begin experiencing joy receiving something clean next christmas ! apparently revenge dish best served cleaned . ax ~ *hint : you * handle * it ?	-1

i started out magnalite aluminum pans bride too many years ago . 20 years later those pitted relics went goodwill replaced calphalon anodized aluminum non-stick interiors . they lasted perhaps 10 years before non-stick started flake off . i wanted stainless steel : dishwasher safe , virtually non-destructable , etc . so , search began . revereware , like my mother still uses after almost 60 years , much more flimsy than it used . farberware ? non-stick or not ? one could practically buy house price high end stainless , though it certainly built last long . i would occasionally check houseware stores , amazon other websites looking good , reasonably priced stainless cookware . imagine my extreme good luck when this cookware came sale , there no shipping deal $25 off purchase boot ! i should bought lottery ticket day ! cuisinart chef classic set showed up less than week . i unpacked all pans lids , washed them up put them cupboard . all other pans went way magnalite . although manufacturer says handwashing best , they go into dishwasher come out bright shiny . creature habit , i still use sos scouring pads remove stains polish metal bit . manufacturer not recommend this , nor they recommend use metal utensils . saucepans starting show wisk marks , but shows these pans used loved . lids fit well saucepans i don't boil-overs like i used . plan following instructions relating low heat start-ups ; these pans get hot quickly hold heat very well . i still use my old , reliable cast iron frying pans frying foods , but frying pans saute pan good items pantry . all lids interchangeable according size . i am very pleased . cookware set superior what i before deal through amazon incredible .	1
i'm not fan how enormous wine glasses restaurants these days but these glasses seem like perfect size ( although still larger than glasses we upgrading ! ) . i like they modern shape feel high-quality . although intended white wine , inward curve lid subtle enough i feel comfortable serving red wine them well . major downside they large enough they don't fit upright top rack non-adjustable dishwasher . we quickly broke one trying wash them precarious angle learned our lesson	-1

i'm fan spanish-made henckel int'l classic lines . i bread knife utility knife well . i think major budget concessions ( these not high-end german-made line ) comes size . classic blades , though full-tang thrice-riveted , less steel than comparable brands . this makes them slender light hand . however , less steel not lower-quality steel , these blades incredibly hard reliable . this santoku still large enough use spatula when cutting , delivering onions , mushrooms or other slices or mince pan while cooking speedily . it sharpens easily ( i use small stone under running water ) , responds well steel every few uses . it sharpest blade my collection , easily slicing up my sponges when i clean it . care , it won't same your skin , mostly because sturdiness construction breeds confident handling . it won't slide off most vegetables before slicing , even cleave small poultry bones slow steady pressure downward ( i wouldn't use it hack real cleavers ) . this precision instrument , not blunt tool	-1

i looking crockpot wasn't too large wasn't too expensive . this product fit bill . lid treated glass so , you see food cooking without lifting lid . lid handle stays cool during cooking , so you won't burn your fingers if you touch it . ceramic cooker sturdy alittle heavy . it become slippery when wet , so careful while washing it sink . also careful because handles cooker metal base become very hot during cooking . so keep potholders nearby . cooker accomodate 3.5 -4 pound whole chicken 4 pound roasts . it oval shape enables these foods fit well . it comes small instruction manual includes some recipes . so far , i've cooked whole grain cereal ( barley cracked wheat ) , stews , whole chickens , corned-beef , turkey legs . they've turned out good . however , since i'm new slow-cooking , first attempts abit off because i cooked food too long . but now , i'm better timing so food better . just side note , if you like eating whole grain cereals , slow cooker terrific . you don't need stand over stove stirring pot worrying it boil over . this cooking method allows grains fully absorb water , which makes creamier end result . plus , you toss grains water into cooker bedtime it time your breakfast . i two very minor complaints : 1 . packaging . cooker packaged way you slide it out box . if you aren't careful , you could drop ceramic cooker or glass lid . 2 . handle lid alittle loose , could made tighter 1 turn . but might not design flaw , but way compensate expansion glass during cooking process . so , don't mess it , im o.o therwise this great product	1

i never owned nice pepper mill . i've always used red box , recently plastic low-quality mill constant battle use properly . i enough wanted nice mill . but shopping amazon.com pepper mills difficult task since there literally hundreds choose . after shopping pepper mill month i decided this mill because beautiful wood , competitive pricing . alternatively , i consider few battery-operated mills . but end i preferred warm inviting look natural wood instead cold metallic looking mills . i choose cherry wood over maple thinking cherry more durable would resist dings scratches heavy use . perhaps better point cherry grain ever so slightly darker than maple pictures . i preferred darker grain . after my order , i didn't receive any order tracking information amazon.com . i wrote email brentwood mills , they responded very quickly . my pepper mill arrived week good packaging . let me say short after it few weeks i absolutely love this pepper mill . brentwood mills a+ company . but let me give you details . when mill arrived , i opened inspected it like anyone would . unfortunately , there very small factory defect - chip near bottom inside where ground pepper exists . it not visible exterior very , very small . my best guess boring bit into solid piece wood caused it . i wrote brentwood mills back asking them if this normal or truly defect . they responded quickly indicating it very rare mill leaves their factory less than perfect shape . they mentioned 3 quality checkpoints ensure high quality control . but course , they offered exchange it me their cost if it bothered me . i decided live it week see . wood beautiful even imperfections . integrity , beauty , effectiveness mill a+ despite minor chip . after week though , i decided go ahead exchange because ultimately brentwood qc should caught this unit . i didn't think it unreasonable considering price range . i wrote brentwood back let them know i returning exchange , they very invitingly assured me they would take care me . they then emailed me few days later when they received sent out new mill . replacement mill arrived within week again well packed . inspecting mill showed absolutely no visible defects all . it beautiful example cherry wood . i filled mill peppercorns proceeded use it . it amazing how high quality mill churn out pepper . i tried coarse , finely ground both worked extremely well . grind setting small knob top you manually adjust your liking . crank feels very good my hand , just outstanding . each half-crank mill puts out little less than eighth teaspoon pepper my very unscientific measurement . once you finish mill set it down , no left over ground pepper leaks out . this seems indicate very high quality mill . certainly bonus not pepper crumbs making mess . i absolutely love this mill . fact , my only complaint my wife who says i'm putting too much pepper everything . very minor annoyance filling peppermill peppercorns . because metal spine middle mill must remain centered it somewhat difficult put corns around it . i couple kitchen funnels which made job little easier . but it might nice if brentwood made custom funnel help hold metal spine place during refill . but i think this limitation this type mill you would find anywhere . end i'm extremely satisfied my purchase . wood very lovely my kitchen my table . brentwood mills great company a+ customer service . highly recommend .	1

i this toaster oven almost year now so far it work very well . it toasts great . we've lot frozen food like chicken strips , nuggets , fish sticks , swedish meat balls , etc . i roasted tomatos , baked fish , cookies , reheating pizza also . toaster pratically get used almost everyday . so far , it cook well us . i love full size pull out crumb tray front !!!! i clean it out every so often since it so easy . all other toaster i tray bottom you take whole oven out trash dump it out . size nice too . we family 4 so " 6 slice " capacity just big enough . lot time , i use this oven instead full-size oven . it doesn't take up much more room than lot other 4-slice oven . only " issue " i knobs . they work fine , don't get me wrong . you remember right combination them what you cooking . if you want toast , one knob need toast setting temperture knob needs highest toast setting also . when you want bake , you need remember put knob bake or convection setting . let say you baked something 300 degree last now you want toast you forget redo setting , your toast not going very good . therefore , i see why other might complained it didn't cook food well if they forget set knobs correctly . it not hard , just need remember it . also , it lot more plastic than one thinks . but all all , it good oven price . i'll just see how long it would last	1
i one these machines three weeks . so far i am very satisfied it . it excellent job washing drying clothes . drying take longer but not inconvenience me . machine " dry only " setting so i just pop clothes back if more drying time needed . it runs so quietly i use it almost any time day ( or night ) without worry annoying my condo neighbors . i would not think all one machine would good choice family but single person , it works very well .	-1

political commentary germany one reviewer notwithstanding , this thing works . i 3 them . i don't need fancy measuring equipment tell me it works when it cleans air smoky , unventilated ( windows closed ) room overnight . no odor . my little humidistat tells me room humidity rises roughly 15% lowest speed setting , extra 5-10% each when you go speeds 2 3 , depending room size . i one work where it keeps my skin sinuses drying out winter air , saves me aroma burnt popcorn , which sometimes emanates breakroom . i sometimes add little fragrance , which this great job spreading . just few drops essential oil . yes , venta too expensive , which why i got mine ebay . also , when i needed replacement part venta mailed it me very quickly no questions asked . great warranty	1

i'm big target shopper , but i've never very impressed their furniture . i couple night stands guest bedroom i regret buying now ( but $60 each i don't know what i expected ) . but lately it seems target starting add more quality furniture their selection . we bought two bookshelves this dresser their shabby chic line i am very impressed detail workmanship . most part , it sturdy beautiful . exception dresser hardware ( drawer pulls ) . mentioned several times other reviews , they break easily . particulary when used rambuctious six-year-old bedroom . also , when my husband first took all pieces out box start putting it together , he realized there two left sides instead one left one right . he'd already put some it together so we didn't want take it back target exchange it , so he called manufacturer . they wouldn't anything it unless he receipt . well , one things i love shopping target whenever i return or exchange , i just give them credit card i used pay it they scan find proof purchase . this way i don't hang bunch receipts . other words , i already thrown away receipt this dresser . my husband called them again few days later explained situation they finally agreed send right side panel . other than this little set back , i guess it came together ok . my husband always puts furniture together i didn't hear lot cuss words or yelling coming my daughter room while he working it . but then , he very patient guy actually enjoys putting stuff together . when all said , after shopping around comparing other pieces other stores their prices similar dressers , this one still worth what we paid it . i eventually replace broken knob ( course , i'll replace them all so they'll match ) - but that no-brainer . i don't even need my hubby .	-1

this little heater works well ! snap-down wheels made it very easy install ( no assembly required ) . thermostatic variable control works well ( unlike some others i tried ) . some reviewers reported smelling oil or paint smell when they first turned it , however , i not issue all . since i only obtained my heater end this years heating season , i haven't yet fully tested high heat setting , but low setting , it kept my 20 14 foot room quite comfortable this spring . it makes no noise i able tell , except very slight click when heater turns thermostat setting	-1

what say ? this cheap carpet sweeper , it works great ! main sweeper unit well constructed metal it very sturdy indeed . however , handle 4-piece tubular thingee marginal best . handle 4 sections so it shipped smaller box . sweeper works perfectly my office carpet , i stow it away small file cabinet . i recommend this sweeper occasional use , but i would suggest fabricating solid piece tubing better handle if you intend use this more frequent sweeping . otherwise , 4-piece handle keep falling apart your hands .	-1
although it doesn't mention it , these hepa filters also fit hamilton beach air cleaner model 04152 . i email hamilton beach find out , but they very helpful responded right away . when filters arrived amazon , i saw box it says " fits models 04162 , 04163 04152 . " our cat houseful antiques , we always seem dust bunnies floating around . i run this model our office , under table which holds computer . since placing it there i noticed buildup dust around modem almost entirely eliminated . i placed larger model our living room it certainly doing its job . regular settings louder than expected , but i leave them " whisper quiet " setting when we're room i don't even notice them . i would definitely recommend hamilton beach air cleaners	1

i waffling 2 stars 3 stars because this isn't horrible product ... but it could alot better minor modifications . positive side : unit arrived time . it heats up quickly . it produces lots steam . mop window attachments worked particularly well . negative side : i supposed able download product manual but file defunc t.t he soap dispensor attachment not work inititially . ( i disassembled it fixed problem 5 minutes .. but it still pain . product overview included " internal cord storage " it not this feature . ( i assume they refer manually spooling cord around casters caddy storage " internal cord storage " but it misleading best . product overview reported " easy use rotary dial " i still no i dea what refers . there no water level gauge help you know how much water left machine/ or when it close " full " when filling i t.t he shoulder strap system awkward . product lightweight , however carrying product over your shoulder so it constantly hits you thigh annoying ( it would much more convenient able carry it like backpack . this would deman dramatically different design . there no pressure guage or way knowing when unit " safe enough open up ... " ( there just sticker reminds user wait 15 minutes after unplussing machine before opening it refill it .... oh yes ... make sure user " depress hold steam release trigger " make sure tank isnt pressurized before opening tank . -- course unit not steam release trigger ... it electronic switch which only works if unit plugged . this creates saftey hazzard because if you unplug unit wall wait 15 minutes .... there still alot hotwater/steam/ pressure tank . if you click electronic switch open ( nothing happens because unit unplugged ) you may assume unit safe open thus release all pent up steam which puts you risk nasty hand burn . i agree previous reviewers ordering extra supplies mop heads soap inconvenien t.t he machine perform it primary function ( cleaning ) well ... but deficiencies product design , misleading advertising , plus poor documentation/ difficulty reodering supplies all compel me recommend looking other steam cleaning option	-1
love this flannel construction . i concerned since it priced so low , but they wonderful . i love quality construction upon washing there no shift or shrink . buy many , this price you not able replace it ! you also see my review cleopatra this same collection . we ordered both figuring this price , it would worth gamble ! it !!!! there no gamble all .	1

after reading some reviews here , i concerned buying this cleaner , even though it seemed exactly what i looking replace my expired 1974 model eureka electric broom ( brand loyalty lead me look eureka , but unfortunately , company bought sold several times , they no longer make quality product they when i purchased my electric broom . ) i visited my local independent vacuum dealer i used past keeping my eureka going all these years ; when he informed me he couldn't get parts rebuild motor ; i asked his recommendation , he endorsed hoover flair . when i voiced my concern breaking housing , he showed me how problem area reinforced - i mean plastic tapers 1 " thick this point . hoover now owned maytag , they concerned making quality product . based upon , strength evidenced thickness plastic this area , i laid my fears rest bought machine . vacuum performs excellently both carpet bare floors - i like fact there no metal nozzle scratch my hardwood floors ; it also handles cat hair cat litter ease . summary , i recommend this cleaner wholeheartedly !!	1
problem bachelor if you standard coffee maker own typical 12-cup coffee pot , you make least four cups coffee make decent tasting pot coffee . which means you consume two cups throw out other two . i didn't like idea wasting coffee . while i stopping dunkin cup but i realized approach wasn't frugal solution problem . i've looking ideal single-cup coffee maker solution few years . i decided try this one out after review well-known consumer magazine . most part , it works well . it doesn't take up huge amount counter space . it intitally brewed weak cup coffee . i experiemented amounts coffee discovered if you doubled up amount coffee , it brew flavorful cup coffee . also ( despite what instructions say ) use very warm or hot water tap . contact time heating element not sufficient get water hot enough extract all flavor components your coffee . thus you get weak tasting cup coffee this unit . also if you grind your own coffee , i recommend finer grind this machine it brews too quickly can't extract enough flavor standard drip grind . i'm mostly pleased this coffee maker after some experimentation adjustments water temperature , grind coffee , amount coffee .	-1
i wasn't sure what expect this pan , but it outshined everything i'd anticipated , based price . i got it less than ten bucks friday sale , i've already used it least ten times . it great frying ( i made fried chicken couple times , it came out perfectly , no hot spots . ) i've used it make spaghetti sauce , french toast , taco meat , chili mexican shredded chicken chicken nachos . it heavy enough feel sturdy your hand , they're snap clean , even mexican chicken ( you cook down couple hours . ) i haven't any problems sticking or scratching , it actually inspires me cook . you won't disappointed purchasing this pan ! it great cook uses lot different techniques or methods cooking ( soups , frying , steaming ) .	1

this pillow looks simple enough , but there must lot research put into inventing it ! dogbone ( medium size , 16 " -- i don't remember specific dimensions ) instantly relieved many aches i my neck without forcing me lie down flat position ( which often gives me headache makes it impossible read while lying down ) . i'd doc quite few times back/neck problems i've lately , but no rx worked quite well this delightful cushion . my only issues it cleaning ( stuffing packed very tight , so i'd rather not try it out washer fear mold/mildew ; i spray it disinfectant every once while instead ) outer material ( optional moisture-wicking or allergen-reducing pillowcase would nice ) . however , i bought it based earlier reviews , i don't regret it	-1

i 2 honeywell 50100 air purifiers bought 2 these replacement hepa filter originals . hrf-11 new " permanent " replacement filter good choice . however , i rated this 4-star only despite fitting nicely 50100 . product statement " permanent " misleading , though you clean filter twice year vacum cleaner , manual still recommends you replace filter every 3 5 years under normal usage . i think kaz ( who licenses honeywell brand honeywell ) simply asking sued labeling product like this . i'll use words " extended life " if i them avoid law suits . other than , its great product cheaper than those throw-away type filters	-1

i recently purshased this set real problems trying get lids ' snap ' . majority lids almost fit , which somewhat frustrating itself . i've tried pressing , pushing , popping , even putting all my weight lids without success . swearing didn't help lids fit any better , either . no surprise ... it seldom . i even tried pliers try snap lid oval piece . only succeeded breaking lid . aforementioned swearing rapidly graduated cursing , although no hair cuttings , nail clippings , hatpin-stuck small dolls , nor sacrificial small animals involved . , lid still didn't pop onto cookware . you just marvel how lids come sooooo close fitting ... but , just absolutely refuse go extra hair width make seal . nordicware .... what deal those lids ???!!!! lid issue aside , i've used cookware frequently storing leftovers fridge microwave reheating same , cookware works fine . it cleans up well , it looks nice . there , i've said something positive . but , again ... nordicware .... what deal those lids ???!!!	-1

this review intended 4700 series pictured here see-through dustcontainer ! it joy use simplicity every way . engineers used sheer genius its plain simple design . my hard use might tend make automatic shut-off come into play , when years cat hair or whatever clogged filter first use , but i not expect happen again , i no cat . it previous owner years no vacuuming which caused it . if you motor turn off , wait half hour recommended , hey take break read good book amazon , then start her up again . but sure before you rest on/off pedal off position or motor might not realize it recovering not start up again . also unplug then certain plug it back ! notice no-clog hose . i finally give up my beloved eureka hepa filtered after yeaers very hard usage finally made right angle turn where hose hits floor forward brushes constantly blocked . i got tired dismantling tiny hard reach screws prying out collected dirt dust hair such . i must confess : i used abused my former eureka , including potting soil corner , paid price . now i discover very inexpensively elegant simplicity this wonderfully engineered marvel . notice again no-clog hose . rather than hidden right angle turn bottom , hose comes straight out , easily detached bottom clearing , which unnecessary any case . rather than multitude filters replaced great cost every few months , there one , which rinses off water . instead whole bunch attachments falling off main stand , there basics , no more , no less , including generously long wands attach generously long hose . most powerful engine available , full bore , blasting up floor , under this light weight yet poweful tool . check out interesting engineering floor clearance . rather than estimating carpet shag , or whether you pass mainly over bare floor low carpet , thus struggling turn hard reach clearance dial stiff fingers , you just hit engagement foot pedal clearance automatically adjusts present floor conditions , continues so fly you pass condition condition , rug linoleum . when machine ready rest , however unwillingly like young colt ready run some more but put away early stable , restoring it upright condition raises it clearance high enough roll into storage . handle easily effectively lowered reaching under tables even beds , powerful headlight really makes visuals ineluctably bright . engineers eureka really designed effective useful tool this one , elegant simplicity use maintenance . assembly also breeze joy one screwdriver . this one get . never mind those cheapo shop vacs lousy plastic attachments ; never mind those much more expensive rigs seductively bizarrely promising continuous suction . this one . take my advice , freely given . you may even thank me it . or let me come over dump dirt your carpet show you how great machine this . joy use . i can't wait carpet fill up dust again ! makes vacuuming contemplative prayer spiritual cleansing . further strong points this vac , those who not yet believe it , please notice handy handle near base which makes vacuuming up stairs easier , especially considering sturdy yet lightweight this vacuum . also notice ease removing emptying dirtbag ( i know it more canister but dirtbag great word ) rinsing out filter . i few moments puzzle putting dirtbag back but soon become second nature . i also must admit not used staircleaning feature i no stairs here desert .	1

i bought this pressure cooker set month ago i love it . i never used pressure cooker before i bought this set , but i find it easy use very safe . set comes nice instruction book ( cooking times lots different food ) small book recipes . i like i cook brown rice less time than it takes me make white rice without pressure cooker ( 20 minutes ) . i successfully adapted recipe slow-roasted pulled pork prepare it sauce scratch less than hour . long you're not looking crusty exterior , i think you make food comperable quality oven or slow-cooker much shorter amount time . i find two pots very convenient making different quantities food . glass lid , they work very well other tasks such steaming veggies briefly . my only complaint set insides pots hard get clean . here directions cleaning fagor website : " sometimes stains may build up inside your pressure cooker normal everyday use . good way remove stains add equal parts lemon juice water your cooker heat this liquid until hot . you then use nonabrasive sponge remove stains . not clean cooker any abrasive materials this may damage finish your pressure cooker .	1

one might imagine whole concept vacuuming-flip-mopping progressive some way , but it really not make job cleaning floor easier . especially when product heavy hard maneuver poor pickup . i'd much rather go over floor good vacuum , then follow functional , well-designed good mop ( like old steammop they discontinued ) . these things function better seperate units , which why there no washing machine that also dryer . flip-it very loud machine -- so loud , i didn't hear my phone ring same room . this makes it difficult listen my 3 children , too . it difficult push feels like it gripping floor . it doesn't fit into any tight places or under any low chairs/cabinets it big fat part-vacuum head . , when you're finished , it pain clean out nozzle filter(which you're supposed keep dry somehow ) so you look forward second job once you've finished job cleaning your floors . , because " flip it " back forth design , thing no equilibrium ... it fell floor least 3 times , even when i so careful rest it against something ... once when this happened , " dirty water " recovery tank hit floor , fell off machine spilled dirty water all over my just-cleaned floor . true nightmare . i bought this product because i could no longer buy replacement filters/pads my bissell steammop , i thought i better give latest greatest try , but , sadly , i disappointed . i don't review things often , but i felt responsibility warn others out there who shopping good mop keep their homes clean . this contraption not your answer . side note , i wrote bissell bring back steammop ( what excellent product ) , so i'm hoping they one day	-1

why oh why i buy this useless thing ? i perfectly good cuisipro mesh 13-inch screen , which what it supposed , namely reduce spray grease spewing onto burners , walls , floor . it perfect ? no . but it definitely most job , which what i can't say tovolo . it three fatal flaws . first , working end detachable metal handle proportionally too small securely safely leverage screen off . i use one hand steady metal edge lid -- hot hot hot -- i tried wedge handle under screen lip my other hand . second , count number air holes silicone screen . then , count holes metal mesh cuisipro , or its ilk . purpose screen catch grease , this important part , allow steam escape , otherwise water vapor condenses back onto food . i first tried using tovolo saute ground beef . beef began stew water dripping surface screen . third , too much grease escapes around edge screen because metal rim bows heat . all fairness , mesh type bows also , but not much , possibly because edge thin more pliable . this product , imo , just one more silicone kitchen gadget not work well metal version . save your money buy old fashioned kind .	-1

unique looking soft polypropylene body contrasting chrome ; distinctive attractive item sits plain view kitchen all time . normal bread before lowering , bread sticks almost 1/2 way out toaster , making it very easy remove hot toast , toast smaller items ( plunger go up even further assist ); slots extra wide so , although i not used sandwich cage accessory , i see how there enough room make sandwich toast it cage ( apparently british idea , maybe something worth investigating ) . i am doing normal toast only setting 2 , bagels 3 separate bagel feature they come out perfect !

le creuset manufactures porcelain enameled cast iron cooking vessels well other quality products . enameled cookware cast molten iron formed sand moulds which used only once . this reason , one pan may look like , but each unique its own way . cast iron highly efficient material which absorbs distributes heat efficiently . this reason , it recommended use low medium heat . there few exceptions like boiling water where cooking high heat appropriate okay . otherwise , cooking high heat may cause food stick , discolor enamel coating , or cook food unevenly . remove cast iron heat it not cool off quickly . this helps your food stay warm while serving . beware ; iron tends heavy so these cooking vessels tend heavy well . cast iron effective material cooking so why cover it enamel ? iron tends rust ; iron oxide ( rust ) doesn't add any complimentary flavors your food . if your cast iron cooking vessel not enameled , you would season maintain it . adding porcelain enamel not only looks good , but multiple benefits . enamel , solid coating , one most hygienic surfaces cook , not stain , absorb odors , retain flavors , easy clean . enamel damaged , so limit cooking tools plastic or wood . benefits cooking le creuset cast iron many , but lets get down roasting pan specifically . this pan holds 5 1/4 quarts food , measures 9 3/4 14 3 inches internally , weighs 10.2 pounds . 5 1/4 quarts typically feed 8 - 10 people when it comes casseroles , so consider your recipes when determining size you need . except roasts , roasting pan tends best if least 3/4 full . any less you may overwhelm your food heat evenly dispersed pot . i find cast iron adds crispy texture food may desirable dish like mac-n-cheese , while not so desirable other dishes . add le creuset 9 11 1/2 inch roasting rack roasting chickens pork loins keeping them out grease . some other possibilities this pan include casseroles , pork chops covered cornbread dressing , dinner rolls , baked squash , lasagna , scalloped potatoes , cobblers , pineapple upside down cake , or bread pudding . possibilities almost seem endless your imagination . one feature people tend complain cost . cost seem steep compared other pans made other materials . heck , cast iron doesn't seem like it should expensive when comparing old cast iron pan past generations used cornbread camping . however manufacturing process requires making mould each every pan produced . they then go through enameling process before shipping these heavy pans . if you take what goes into making distributing these high quality cast iron products , cost tends make sense . then consider this pan easily last lifetime when taken care . pros : extremely versatile efficient absorption distribution heat hygienic enamel cooking surface not stain , absorb odors , or retain flavors easy clean when not abused or misused transferred stove top oven table easily last lifetime cons : its heavy , cast iron tends weighing 10.2 pounds	1
many you reading these reviews may wondering how this compares similar items made cast iron . i tell you , while it obviously isn't cast iron reason alone many say it inferior , it still excellent griddle . bottom very heavy it conducts heat well . it fits perfectly over 2 burners one side my gas stove . i've cooked several sandwiches once it well pancakes some eggs , heat seems distribute very evenly . i very impressed this aspect griddle , cast iron known its even heating i wondering how aluminum griddle would hold up ; it definitely fine job . bonus , course , nonstick surface , it good one , not some chintzy teflon coating . good quality construction . handles solid it doesn't feel cheap all when you hold it . take care this griddle ( make sure it doesn't get scratched ) it take care you	1

if you pets constantly dragging out your heavy vacuum cleaner , then you love this one . i bought this vacuum supplement my large ( heavy ) canister vacuum pleasantly surprised its ability pick up pet hair . because small bagless chamber , you empty it frequently , so i wouldn't count this vacuum my only vacuum cleaner . i wanted lightweight vacuum use my hardwood floors area rugs , specifically pick up pet hair , this vacuum exceeded my expectations . i tried shark , similar model made fantom , cordless vacuum not one them worked anywhere near well this one ( stay away fantom cordless - far worst !! ) . i don't think any cordless vacuum enough power pick up pet hair like this one . overall , this vacuum great little vacuum quick clean-ups or maintain pet-hair free area rugs . one suggestion - use carpet setting even bare floors . brushes high enough so they won't scratch bare floors , but cleaning capability much less without rolling brush . i found it just rolled over dog hair without picking it up unless i used carpet setting . only reason i not give it 5 stars because small holding chamber which requires frequent emptying .	-1

this lovely little crockpot whose small size makes it uniquely useful number purposes . i've owned larger crockpots couple decades ( currently 6 quart rival smartcooker my mainstay preparing family-size meals ) , but larger pots take up significant amount counter space aren't all useful heating or re-heating small quantities . this little crockpot , however , perfect heating or re-heating 2-4 servings soup or stew . i originally bought it , however , because it * absolutely perfect * making hot cereal cold mornings , especially those hot cereals require more than few minutes cooking microwave or stovetop , such steel-cut oatmeal ( try nutty goodness traditional steel-cut oatmeal once ( also available here amazon ) you're unlikely ever return instant or " quick cook " oatmeal again ) . there nothing nicer cold winter morning than walking into kitchen knowing healthy , delicious hot breakfast awaiting you . mid-october late-march , virtually every night i prepare my entire family hot breakfast cereal next morning this little crockpot , no more effort than required make single serving instant oatmeal or cream wheat microwave . other uses we've discovered : it perfect making serving hot mulled cider ; keeping hot dips , gravies warm sauces syrups heated buffet ; substitute fondue pot ; heating soup times when hovering over stovetop or near microwave would incovenient ( how nice come inside raking leaves or shoveling snow hot bowl soup ! ) . single people or couples who prefer not cook large quantities or apartment dwellers limited storage space , this crockpot would very acceptable slow cooker , especially if used conjunction rival inexpensive sp100-pdq smart-part module ( also sold amazon date this review ) , which provides same timed-cooking controls integrated many rival larger , more expensive crockpots . energy used minimal , too -- only 80 watts -- stoneware bowl fits easily dishwasher , lid , very convenient clean-up	1

i'm proud celiac chick finland , but i'm also lover homemade donuts . now , those you who don't know what celiacs , we can't eat any wheat or gluten . plain-speak ( no , i'm not implying you're stupid ) , we can't eat flour . it runs lines allergy , although experts gladly look down their noses tell you it not . so how heck i eat donuts when they're made completely flour ? answer my cooking angel , bette hagman , who wrote up donut recipe one her books , more gluten free gourmet . anyway , i use recipe . however , i don't use this donut mold like i'm supposed . no , i don't baked donuts-what donut if you don't indulgent full-fat thing ? i put batter into three molds time , tip it into oil , i deep fat fry those little suckers . god , they good ! so , my ultimate point here this donut mold extremely useful , more ways than one . so grab one -- especially if you're celiac -- put your imagination cooking skills work	1

le creuset manufactures porcelain enameled cast iron cooking vessels well other quality products . these cooking vessels cast molten iron poured sand moulds which used only once . this reason , one pan may look like , but each unique its own way . cast iron highly efficient material which absorbs distributes heat . due this efficiency , it recommended cooking cast iron low medium heat . remove cast iron heat it not cool off quickly . this helps your food stay warm while serving . beware ; iron tends heavy so these cooking vessels tend heavier than other pans made alternate materials . cast iron effective material cooking so why cover it enamel ? iron tends rust ; iron oxide ( rust ) doesn't add any complimentary flavors your food . if your cast iron cooking vessel not enameled , you would season maintain its cooking surface . adding porcelain enamel not only looks good , but multiple benefits . enamel , solid coating , one most hygienic surfaces cook , not stain , absorb odors , retain flavors , easy clean . enamel damaged , so limit contact wood or plastic utensils eliminate scratching scoring porcelain . benefits cooking le creuset cast iron many , but lets get down roasting pan specifically . this pan holds 2 1/2 quarts food , measures 7 3/4 11 1/2 inches internally , weighs 6 1/2 pounds . 2 1/2 quarts not lot space when it comes casseroles , so consider your recipes when determining size you need . this may pan families 2-4 . except roasts , roasting pan tends best if least 3/4 full . any less you may overwhelm your food heat evenly dispersed pot . i find cast iron adds crispy texture food may desirable dish like mac-n-cheese , while not so desirable other dishes . add le creuset 7 1/2 9 inch roasting rack roasting chickens pork loins keeping them out grease . some other possibilities this pan include casseroles , pork chops covered cornbread dressing , dinner rolls , baked squash , scalloped potatoes , cobblers , pineapple upside down cake , or bread pudding . possibilities almost seem endless your imagination . one feature people tend complain cost . cost seem steep compared other pans made other materials . heck , cast iron doesn't seem like it should expensive when comparing old cast iron pan past generations used cornbread camping . however manufacturing process requires making mould each every pan produced . they then go through enameling process before shipping these heavy pans . if you take what goes into making distributing these high quality cast iron products , cost tends make sense . then consider this pan easily last lifetime when taken care . pros : extremely versatile efficient absorption distribution heat hygienic enamel cooking surface not stain , absorb odors , or retain flavors easy clean when not abused or misused transferred stove top oven table easily last lifetime cons : its heavy , cast iron tends weighing 6 1/2 pounds	1

i've gone through number grinders over years am hoping this kitchenaid last longer than others . grind consistent quite adjustable . even glass container , there still static causing cling sides dispersal grinds counter . small price pay fresh ground coffee . because it slower , it quieter . flavor brew better because beans weren't heated when ground . read instruction manual happy results first time . commenter says kitchenaid replace hopper or receptacle later design works better . i'm thinking following up ... beans didn't feed through , but only one time . so i upended it shook beans back down all fine again	1

i waited years buy calphalon cookware because i under false impression its quality . i old set . . waterless cookware made ecko ; ecko set outperformed calphalon every measurement . my thought buying new set ecko cheap , calphalon quality . every thing sticks this set , pork chops even stuck so called non-stick surface pan ; no chops not right fridge , would cause them stick . some pans without non-stick coating dimples metal . box states they dishwasher safe ; however instructions state differently . electric stove one pans developed burn marks bottom pan over medium high heat . list goes , if you contact customer service you get canned answers send cookware them your cost ; they not read mine . oh they tell me i could keep lids , no wonder they not fit ; you move them 1/8 " back forth . not buy !	-1

after conducting research few weeks , visiting amazon , well other coffee aficionado sites , i finally purchased saeco aroma espresso maker using it going two weeks . although this machine may not glitzy appearance compared some machines , it make great espresso . say instance , if francis francis sexy ferrari espresso machines , then aroma would volvo -- boxy ( perhaps considered bland appearance some ) but solid , reliable , well-built machine price . once i got hang using pressurized portafilter , which put tightly obtain correct seal/pressure , i treated rich , flavorful espresso lots crema . i am pleased ease using machine , however , instructions not very detailed i found technical support slow . initially i placed phone call -- where i not reach live person -- but left message . never received call back , but called again next day which time i get live person . honest , she seemed ambivalent downright unhelpful , blaming my problem coffee i using ( despite my best efforts explain problem ) . issue after priming machine installing portafilter , pump would run run , but no espresso would come out . i ended up tightening three little screws bottom portafilter , which seemed help make it fit more snugly achieve pressurized seal . voila ! perfect espresso . if i one complaint this machine , it would portafilter not very substantial , made mostly plastic . aroma steam wand works really well frothing milk . almost too well , i ended up lot foam , but second time using it , i backed off pressure bit , got just right balance milk foam . overall i am pleased performance this machine . it hard find decent machine under $300 . but i would consider this machine mid-level machine entry-level price , especially 15 bars pressure . ( i started out thinking i would buy starbucks barista machine which almost $400 , but after seeing live demo starbucks store , realized it not perform well only 8-12 bars pressure . very little crema ) . good espresso machine should offer minimum 14 bars . two side notes : i urge anyone who purchases espresso machine consider conical burr grinder ( i bought capresso 560.01 infinity burr grinder amazon ) . it crucial fine grind brewing espresso . you'll know when you just right grind because after brewing portafilter basket contain compacted " cake " espresso , rather than soupy mixture water grinds . i not purchase my saeco amazon , but opted instead get it costco website where it $249 ( members or add 5% - or $12.45 - nonmembers ) , including shipping handling . plus it could returned any costco warehouse within 30 days , no questions asked , if not satisfied .	-1

these pillows 6 months , finally drained them threw them out . you don't realize once you fill them water how heavy they ! once they place bed you can't move them ! try lifting them when you change sheets !!! but , you probably bought them due bad back , neck or shoulders now you lift these weights make bed ! what i thinking ? i lucky i didn't wind up traction lifting these things . my husband refused use it after few weeks , said he couldn't get comfortable unable move it easily ( they weigh ton ! ) i hung there longer but wound up using regular pillow top it just able adjust it without get crane lift it . we honestly didn't feel any better sleeping it deal weight them not worth any benefits we might derived . no one mentions this issue their reviews , i wonder if they all maid service	-1

i've using this style maker since 1968 , when i introduced it my friend wife , who grew up little italy ( ny ) . it makes very good espresso ( want improve taste - improve coffee you use ) , i think better but least good machines costing up 5x much . it also simple use , fast , easy clean . this size ( 9-cup ) fills mug , which i like , or two regular cups when i'm sharing . over years i've tried other stove top brands styles , but stick this traditional bialetti ... they've making them forever it down . way , little guy pot isn't flipping us bird !	1

you really can't drink coffee mugs which come this coffeemaker , unless lids off mug ... definite design defect which defeats purpose travel mug . it very simple oversight : there no quot ; ventquot ; hole mug lid , so coffee barely dribbles out sipping hole , even when mug full , even if you tilt mug high if you drinking last drops bottom mug . it very frustrating experience . please also consider two cups may not fill up evenly coffee brews ; one may slightly overflow while other mug not full . then there instruction book . english fine , but it really make sense instruct user heat up mugs first hot water , then instruct user measure cold water into same mug fill reservoir ? course , user figure his way around , but only way use these mugs would drill extra pinhole each mug lid venting , or just use mug around house , without lid . mug comfortable hold , but thermal value not too good , even when preheated boiling water . i regret made this purchase	-1
greetings , i love this stove top espresso maker but there some differences you may find value . 1)- boiler where you put water only filled 25% compared most 70% which means rather large unit relation amount espresso you make . 2)- maintenance more than others because this machine uses more pressure there more seals replace when necessary . these not readily available locally you probably them shipped you extra expense may exceed your sense reasonableness . also .. most these types machines come extra seals . this unit doesn't come any extra seals all . 3)- picture looking through window top machine seeing nice crema farce . only way see nice crema if you carefully follow directions lift lid up wipe condensation off inside always present blocks your view . 4)- realize this unit made aluminum some concerned toxic effects if any gets into your java high acidity content . plusus include - 1)- very nice tasty espresso superior other stove top machines . ( no aluminum taste)2)- really nice crema but only if yor coffee fine grind #1 , or #2 coffee needs freshly ground . if you buy pre-ground coffee packages market you not seeing any crema . i buy fresh coffee ground half pound #1 , or #2 fine grind get really good results . i hope this helpful you . cheers	-1

perfect rice everytime but i've never cooked more than 2 cups dry rice time . i'm always present so i don't need it shut off : ' warm ' fine . but what i really like it great job cooking hot cereal ( steel cut oats , 7 grain- etc ) . cereals always tend bubble over while cooker lid gets bit messy it never boils over . it easy clean too . i'm thinking getting one our cabin .

we used cuisinart 25 years ! it getting worn out parts not available make it like new . kitchenaid looks great plenty power but , big but , it not work what we want . first amount fluid it hold pathetic compared old cuisinart . kitchenaid leaked like sieve via gap lid bowl . complicated " safety " system allows something placed feeder tube but not fingers also prevents us slicing cucumber or even reasonable sized potato ! i wonder who designs these products .. obviously o-o ne who cooks ! when our cuisinart finally gives up my wife says she go back knife . we tried this product returned it full refund thanks amazon	-1
le creuset manufactures porcelain enameled cast iron cooking vessels well other products . le creuset casts these cooking vessels molten iron poured sand moulds used only once . this reason , one pot may look like , but each unique its own way . cast iron highly efficient material which absorbs distributes heat efficiently . it recommended cooking cast iron low medium heat . however , there exceptions like boiling water where cooking high heat appropriate okay . remove cast iron heat it not cool off quickly . this heat retention helps your food stay warm while serving . beware ; iron tends heavy so these cooking vessels . cast iron effective material cooking so why cover it enamel ? iron tends rust ; iron oxide ( rust ) doesn't add any complimentary flavors your food . if your cast iron cooking vessel not enameled , you would season maintain your cooking vessel . adding porcelain enamel not only looks good , but multiple benefits . enamel , solid coating , one most hygienic surfaces cook , not stain , absorb odors , retain flavors , easy clean . enamel damaged , so limit cooking tools plastic or wood . benefits cooking le creuset cast iron many , but lets get down buffet casserole specifically . buffet casseroles one most versatile pieces le creuset lineup . use this pan saut� pan , roasting pan , poaching , or shallow braiser . 3.5 quart capacity plenty space when it comes casseroles , so consider your recipes when determining size you need . buffet casserole tends best if least three quarters full . any less you may overwhelm your food evenly dispersed heat pot . large flat bottom curves up this pan resembles curved sided saute pan only thing missing would long handle . tight fitting lid mostly flat curved sides . this lid seals heat , moisture , flavors used hold your meat while you making sauce drippings . its shape design makes this extremely versatile pan . i tend use this pot basic dishes like smothered pork chops more than anything else . but once you get past basic functionality lends itself recipes such paella , frittatas , deep dish pizza , casseroles , you really open up possibilities . keep mind this 3.5 quart pan , feeding two out if it ridiculous unless you want leftovers . it probably perfect size family four most cases . try baking pineapple upside down cake or bread pudding when you need please many guests , poaching fish , or mac cheese . possibilities almost seem endless . one feature people tend complain cost . cost seem steep compared other pans made other materials . heck , cast iron doesn't seem like it should expensive when comparing old cast iron pan past generations used cornbread camping . however manufacturing process requires making mould each every pan produced . they then go through enameling process before shipping these heavy pans . if you take what goes into making distributing these high quality cast iron products , cost tends make sense . then consider this pan easily last lifetime when taken care . pros : extremely versatile efficient absorption distribution heat hygienic enamel cooking surface not stain , absorb odors , or retain flavors easy clean when not abused or misused transferred stove top oven table easily last lifetime cons : its heavy , cast iron tends weighing 12.25 pounds	1

bought this toaster after attempting find decent one local . most everything local big boxes basically junk . thought i would try this toaster based my previous good experience krups brand , not disappointed . toasted everything white pumpernickel , pop tarts , bagels , etc ... heat settings bagel/frozen buttons real good job . handle which also raises toast , something i thought just unecessary extra , actually very handy keeps your fingertips out fire . built well , nice job , recomended	1

i'm one those folks who only sleep " white noise " background . i used use big lasko box fans , but cheap plastic blades those would eventually weaken flap around , making roaring sound . plus poorly designed made screws held grills place would eventually weaken cause grill bang against metal box , making tapping sound all night long would wake dead . i little nervous getting this fan i'd only used huge box fans , this one seemed too efficient quiet make real difference air making " white noise " fall asleep . i actually purchased it bed bath beyond ( not amazon ) $100 , so i'm not sure if there lower price out there somewhere . anyway , i wanted try it home see what i thought , thinking if i didn't like it i could return i t.t he fan incredibly easy put together , you make it two different heights ... short near-the-floor height , or " my bedroom so hot i need fan blowing right me i lay bed " height . low , you barely hear fan , however it moves much air big box fan high . when vornado high , it makes pleasing white-noise sound , really moves air around whole room . it easy adjust point it where you want air go . i point it upper corner my room so air bouces off travels everywhere else ... it really works ! grill extremely easy remove ( no screws all ... just four secure clips ) , fan blade slides right off shaft ( no screw there , either ) . this make it simple clean just under faucet sink or bathtub when it inevitably gets dusty dirty . if you looking whole room circulator or white-noise sleep aid , i couldn't recomment any fan higher ! good quality construction well-engineered thought went into every aspect this product . you won't go wrong	1

i am editing this review clarity . no , i am not talking carbon . this one best brita filter systems i've used . i also use large water cooler model offers hot cold dispensing , i've used several pitcher sizes over years . this large dispenser fits almost anywhere holds far more water than pitcher sizes . valve works perfectly closes securely . so , if capacity more important than portability , this great dispenser . because valve , kids use this much easier than they might full , large pitcher . my only problem it mould-like stuff grows mine . no , that not carbon all us brita users used ignoring . it fuzzy stuff grows clumps sticks plastic very hard remove . maybe that because large upper reservoir remains damp closed longer than smaller pitcher system would because it upstairs where my air conditioning doesn't reach . it hot up there most year . because relatively small , but convenient , filler opening , it not easy see into reservoir through it . so , it easier just keep filling without looking into it until filler time . i going discard this , but after realizing nobody household got sick , i decided keep it . i'm leaving one-star rating place because i can't edit it , because i'm tired household members who complain growths . hey , that what faucet . what they think grows there ?	-1

this powerful sylish blender replaced old 12 speed oster which me grumbling every use . two primary selection factors fact it not oster wide-based glass pitcher . i've used this blnder date whirr together protein breakfast smoothies , make soup , mix seasoning rub . it worked well , evenly distributing contents quickly , pureeing squash soup silky smoothness . i like pulse feature this model , feel two speeds all i need . i not used this blender chop ice , i use fresh or partially thawed fruit my smoothies , so i cannot speak feature . i especially like glass pitcher , which wider near blades , easing cleaning . this also seems help distribute protein powder better than old oster , although sort like saying gasoline lawn mower more effective than pruning shears mow lawn . plastic cover seems less wimpy than oster , yet warp out shape dishwasher . i also find pitcher much easier take apart reassemble cleaning . i like pitcher stability , it attractive enough serve . it heavy , but trade-off glass . so far , i am very happy only wish i not waited so long	1
i asked popcorn popper christmas , got this . i wanted air popper , but maybe i wasn't specific when i asked . anyway , cuisinart product , i thought it must good . also , my cousin oil popper ( different brand ) makes great popcorn , so i thought i'd try it . steam collects lid/bowl making wet popcorn . some popcorn burnt , even spinner device , because popcorn stayed heat plate too long after it popped - it can't all top pile . i still tried eat finished popcorn ( unburnt , less wet pieces ) it terrible texture sort too hard - stale maybe - but it fresh corn . plus , even lots butter salt , it sort strange taste - sort chemically maybe ? manual even said something chemicals needing burn off during first few uses ( i even washed it before i used it because possibility ) . lastly , even though it non-stick , it difficult clean cooked oil off heat plate . this worst product ever so many reasons : flawed design , lack ease cleaning , overall performace , terrible end product ! i ended up feeding popcorn my dog - least she seemed like it . i am seriously shocked poor quality this item . i cannot believe cuisinart let it market . how earth it pass their test kitchens ? i wanted popcorn maker so badly now i am stuck piece junk . compared batch popcorn , i'd rather eat raw kernals straight out bag	-1

nutshell : gold standard price tin openers go - there none better , but fact these available around $10 . last literally forever seems too good true . nevertheless , it true . like many other people , we tried lot different openers , some electric some hand held , but we always come back one always our kitchen -- ' swing-a-way ' . what makes ' swing-a-way opener ' superior other openers ? 3 components contribute synergistically swing-a-way success ; 1]- very durable tempered steel gears cutting edge stays sharp literally forever . 2]- ample leverage provided large chrome-plated steel turn-key assure enough torque into gears open any simply hand turning . 3]- plastic coated steel handles facilitate penetration cutting edges just ordinary hand pressure . why these long lasting super openers so inexpensive ? only several moving parts made easily manufactured components sold huge scale worldwide , it costs very little make this product despite its excellence . [ i am not affiliated any product or company but we used ' swing-a-way ' literally forever uniformly excellent result	1

pros : easy use , solid , makes good espressocons : noisy , single insert too smalli bought machine 2 months ago i'm very happy it . i don't use steamer so i can't tell you anything it . i use machine every day make espresso i'm drinking one right now . machine solid well built . it makes very good espresso although i use larger insert double espresso make single shot ( single insert too small me ) . i always get nice rich crema although results vary based brand coffee i use . some reviewers mention coffee comes out cold . i never coffee not warm enough . mine comes out always right temperature ( i use plastic cups usually i wait minute before drinking so i don't burn my tongue ) . make sure you wait orange light go out so right temperature reached . yes , machine somewhat noisy when it operates but i guess that inevitable . making shot takes minute or two subsequent ones made even faster . overall this great product . i use it every day i recommend xp4000	1

this my first waffle maker , so i can't really give good review , but i guess i'm pretty happy it . it beeps ( you kind get used siren-like beeps :)) when pan warmed up it beeps again when waffle . it makes good waffles , but my only complaint it hard spread batter whole entire pan , since batter rises you cook it . my first try i batter overflowing out pan ( pain clean ) , other times i didn't put enough batter ; it takes some practice . i guess if you buy rotating ones batter spread more evenly , but those too expensive my budget . overall i think it good deal money	-1

i read all reviews all dyson models before i decided buying dc 17 model . i 3 dogs i'm always fighting dog hair . much i love my canine buddies , i hate their constant shedding . those who say lab don't shed liars !! i just got my dyson today , like child christmas morning i could not get it out box fast enough . i wish instructions better laid out instead picture form-i like descriptions go pictures . but after while trial error i figured it out . i central canister vacuum system runs through house ( i've hated it beginning ) because my husband thinks that way go . canister out garage he thinks it healthier him not dust house when vacuum emptied . 25 ' hose you drag room room always gets way , i never thought it cleaned well 1st place . it always sore spot . so i decided put it ultimate test . i vacuumed my rugs carpet old relic then came behind dyson . man , [ ... ] came out my so-called " just vacuumed " rugs beyond belief !!! i expected get lot junk , but still amazed how much it actually picked up !!! what everyone else said before me true !!!! fact it hepa filter you clean every 6 months , it appears pretty easy clean pictured instructions , i take bin outside dump it out if he freaks out thinking dust run rampant house when it time empty it . i wanted dyson quite while . i've herd nothing but good things them reviews i read dc 17 model made me finally decide take plunge . i'm sure glad i . i now feel secure knowing when i vacuum floors now they actually clean when i'm !! dyson extended their warrenty 5 years-what other company their vacuum cleaners ? i recommend dyson everyone anyone who listen ! thank you dyson making such outstanding amazing product !!	1

i just received sharpener today henckels santoku . i sharpened half dozen old henckels home found sharpening process very quick . last time i sharpened knives whetstone this process definitely much faster . i get knives sharp manual process . i hoping ' razor ' sharp edge comes brand new knives , but it seems may not achievalble tool . i used new knife benchmark , it not possible me get same degree sharpness . machine provide edges , though , definitely usable , probably better than average person achieve whetstone . much faster . i first followed instructions came sharpener , it quite hard grasp . it asks user hold knife lightly let magnet align knife . what worked me look directly over machine so i see contact knife edge moving abrasive . looking angle trying keep angle consistent , working magnet becomes quite intuitive . trying keep angle constant , hand subconsciously lets magnet align knife . if you pull knife blindly , this process doesn't work quite well ... least beginning , i suppose , since i just started use product . overall i am happy sharpener , would use this over manual sharpening any day . if i sushi chef who whose life depended sharp edge , i would probably not use it , but keep set knives reasonable condition everyday cooking , machine definitely more than adequate	-1

ff x5 great , well built , makes good espresso good froth . however , ff exclusive service center sucks . it better buy appliance fixed locally . i sen't my x5 because it started trip my circuit breaker . their customer service sucks . after few weeks , i called see what diagnosis , first thing they said they didn't receive unit yet but doesn't mean it not their warehouse yet , sometimes warehouse not report them if machine arrived yet until they time process it . after 2 weeks , i called they said they trying call me but my phone not voice mail . i told them over over call me my office number , but they kept calling my home phone number which i don't answering machine . they my home number because number matches my credit card time original purchase . estimate $205.78 i asked them itemize it me , i called them twice this . they never mentioned part this charge $73.73 ups shipping ( it only $46.40 according ups ) . i approved estimate , machine arrived yesterday ... damaged . francis francis didn't want hear my complain , they just told me deal ups claims . ups pick up machine tomorrow inspection . ff declared value only $300 , go figure ? one more thing , i sent it ff original box , they returned it me box ( some sort warehouse box they use ff machines ) . i strong believe original box better , it heavy styrofoam inserts fitted protect machine shipping damage itself . styrofoam inserts original box supports heavy top x5 . x5 , shipped non-original box arrived collapsed top smashing base , disfiguring base 1 inch , it awefull see this heavy metal baby all sad like this . i think this common problem because part packing material non-original box thick cardboard insert says very descriptivelly this piece cardboard needs bee top base otherwise they won't responsible shipping damage . cardboard there , but it obvious me fitted styrofoam better . conclusion , this machine require periodic maintenance repaired factory , however if factory sucks , get brand instead . unless you willing buy new unit every time yours fail , don't get this machine	-1

this early christmas present my loving wife , i weigh dry ingredients our weekly batch belgian waffles , then perfectly time baking built-in repeatable timer . test scale accuracy , i set 2-cup measuring cup platform before switching it so it would zero out weight cup . i then slowly poured water into cup until display read 8 ounces ( every fan " good eats " food network knows " pint pound whole world ' round , " thus , cup liquid weighs 8 ounces ) . water just kissed 8 ounce marking measuring cup . that more accuracy than anyone needs kitchen . tare button lets you zero out scale after each ingredient so you don't add up total weigh t.t he platform looks small but handle 10 inch dinner plate without obscuring display . like my prized waring pro belgian waffle maker ( also christmas gift my darling cathy ) , scale handsome enough leave display all time	1

ceramic cooktop owner who loves cast iron , i invest some enameled cast iron . ( unenameled cast iron may scratch surface . ) i chose le creuset . i enjoy cooking all le creuset skillets pots i own . i noticed some comments here compelled me write this review . black seen pan not teflon , but black cast iron . cast iron skillets come either seasoned or unseasoned . i ones stick worse than others . i can't explain it , but if surface looks dull gray opposed shiny black , it probably needs some grease added it . i usually just spray cooking oil prior cooking easier cleanup . i'm just guessing . directions may found lodge cast iron website . lodge now offers enameled cast iron line nordic ware , but le creuset seems sale more often offered more places . also avoid cracking porcelain enamel , follow manufacturer instructions allowing pan cook down room temperature . extreme temperature changes may crack glaze . i say these really heavy pans i strategize which shelves they go .	1
tri-ply cookware necessity if you own gas stove . thick bottoms thin sides ( " simply calphalon " line , example ) work fine electric stove , but gas stove heat sides enough scorch your food circle above base , sometimes all way up lid . fully-clad tri-ply cookware heats evenly rim rim , so you not get scorching gas stove . ( personally , i think they cook better electric stoves , too . ) calphalon copper cookware enough copper make noticeable difference how evenly pan heats . pan thickness overall 2.8 mm , outside copper layer 0.8 mm -- respectable thickness . others may claim this copper outer layer " doesn't really " matter , but it * * matter . pans made copper tri-ply simply heat faster more evenly than equivalent pan stainless tri-ply . however , well-made stainless tri-ply pans very , very good , nothing scoff . ( ease cleanup stainless nice , too . ) calphalon tri-ply pans same performance league all-clad . i've used both , thickness overall , balance , design , handle lids calphalon pans excellent , fully all-clad level quality . check out price difference yourself . these pans designed more experienced cooks . you need know how preheat pan proper cooking , but when used good technique , stainless-lined saut� pan stick very little -- most cases , when you saut� , you want least * little * sticking , so you get some caramelized fond your food deglazing sauce reductions . soups , sauces more liquid-based cooking , stainless lining works like charm . this particular pan good size many cooking needs -- big enough cook up four people , but not unwieldy . it deep enough add whole bottle wine braising ( room spare ) but shallow enough use spatula without contortions . rounded corners deglazed whisk . all all , entire calphalon tri-ply line exhibits intelligent , traditional design , thoroughly modern " stay-cool " handles ( very comfortable well-balanced ) flared pouring rims . if you torn copper tri-ply pan very expensive stainless-lined solid copper 2.5 mm pan ( like mauviel , bourgeat or falk ) here quick way help you decide : go upscale kitchen store handle one those fancy french solid copper pans . they weigh ton -- they're least twice heavy tri-ply . they cost least twice much . ( they give you great bragging rights , though ... ) always , watch sales , also bogus mark-up/mark-down pricing ( very common here . ) calphalon company website clearly shows legitimate suggested retail price .	1
my husband i just purchased ceramic top stove . after finding out we could no longer use our old , much loved , revere copper-bottomed pots pans new stove , we began look new cookware . so much what out there terribly expensive i don't like stainless steel handles -- they too long store stuff easily pots pans too heavy . addition , " sets " cookware available left too much out - not enough sauce pans -- too many fry pans . thankfully , we found this 14-piece revere 2000 set here amazon . it absolutely eveything i want cookware set . i like " pistol grip " stay cool handles round lid knobs . everything set easy store ( nice , short handles ! ) , easy use stove top , easy clean . cookware heats up quickly efficiently - i able boil water short time medium heat - never turn stove knob " high " . food stays good hot stove lids stove turned off . i no problem cleaning anything - i just put drop dish detergent warm water let pan soak short while . using " tuffy " plastic scrub pad little bit " barkeepers friend " sponge keeps this cookware looking new . i am very pleased this set plan purchase more accessories this line . set practical , highly useable easy store . plus , it didn't cost fortune ! i'm delighted !	1

i bought this set petsmart $50 my long-haired rottweiler . let get one thing straight here - my rottweiler thick hair , 3 inches long , she completely covered dirt all time . these clippers cut through her hair ( i didn't give her bath , so they cut through her dusty fir ) no problems all ! i got 4 good uses out these , then blades finally went dull . i searched andis website which extremely helpful , they show you list blades fit your clippers you buy them or find store sells what you need . replacement blades $16 horse/dog type ... i admit , i contemplated buying sheep clippers my dog one time . motor runs same when i first bought it regardless all dirt hair gone through it . i say even spending $50 these clippers good deal , since taking dog get groomed $40 or more each time ! kit comes ton clipping guides all sizes , sheers , clipper lubricant , brush . it also comes video which i never watched , so i can't say if it would helpful or not . i definitely recommend this any size dog	1

i also own both salt ball pepper ball disagree previous reviewer ; i find both useful table but very unhelpful when cooking . balls both great when seasoning food , but not work all recipes require exact amounts . opening bottom ball extremely large , attempting direct what coming out into teaspoon or tablespoon worthless- you'll use up all pepper before you get whatever measurement you need . additionally , mine ( ordered amazon.com ) not come stand product claims . therefore , when ball sitting counter , it very susceptible picking up things around it- any sort spilt liquid go up into ball ( especially salt one ) ruin whatever inside . i also agree both balls produce very inconsistent salt pepper- even whole pepper balls come through mine . also , amount pepper inside beginning very limited ( mine only 1/4 full when i got it ) . however , if you able keep them dry don't mind refills , these balls give you freshly ground salt pepper , easy use , make cute addition table . i believe both overpriced what they , you wind up paying $30 set . you might want consider either paying extra $10 more durable effective set or sticking cheaper , non-mill varieties .	-1

we not fence , so petsafe wireless fence unit significantly improved quality life dog us . we adjusted base unit allow forest creatures escape . we weren't able put invisible fence where we planned because chain-link enclosure ( dog " sand box " ) beside our driveway interfered signal . collar uses up specialized batteries quickly , so keep supply hand . check collar daily before using . when battery replaced , collar must reset appropriate shock level . we left boundary flags up 10 days although dog figured it out first day . my dog only experienced one shock ( setting four ) first day ; since then , beep enough keep him within boundaries . petsafe retains control over selling price its products , so there no bargain basement prices any vendor .	1

i almost didn't buy this machine because i worried some negative reveiws i've read it users . however , it only machine its price range really caught our eye , so we went ahead purchased it using it six months . it hands down best machine i've ever owned . it great features , espresso best espresso i've made home , better than most espresso i buy american coffee shops . quick rundown great features . 1 . it looks great . it heats up quickly , it very simple use . 2 . size water resevoir pretty generous . it holds enough water 24 shots . you expect get little less if you steaming lot milk , but if you steaming recommended temperature , machine very water efficient , you shouldn't see dramatic drop . we use it every day make least two drinks ( leeast 4 shots ) , lot more weekends , we refill only once week , roughly . design also makes it quite easy refill , i've middle steaming or pulling shot when i realized reservoir low , refilled whiled pulling shot . this awfully convenient . 3 . machine comes disc you put inside porta filter make sort fake crema whipping coffee , which popular upper-end machines these days . however , if you using good coffee , grind your beans fresh , brew coffee recommended temperature , machine produces wonderful genuine crema without disc . i never get espresso coffee house crema good . ( crema more quality coffee than machine , but cheaper machines pull coffee way too hot never produce good cremas because crazy temperatures . ) 4 . steam wand great job genlty steaming frothing without scalding daylights out your milk . i've heard lot complaints steamer , but my experience it works perfectly , easily . 5 . it come adaption pods , if you're into pods ( blech . ) 6 , i love machine temperature gague allows you control temperature your steam coffee , not just indicator lights . it allows you lot more control over quality your espresso . few things so so , included tamp flimsy useless , get yourself nice heavy one . drip tray feel little light cheap compared rest machine , but it perfectly functional . cup warmer isn't very successful warming cups . but these minor quibbles i it . i'm sure if i willing pay 4 or 5 times much , i'd get better espresso , but price , i couldn't happier this machine . it beats any little starter machines you get , makes better espresso than machines cost twice price , my experience . i'm very happy this machine .	-1

i admit i spend lot money pet products , often no response my pets . i thought this , too , would waste $40 , so i thought long hard before purchasing unit . well , i am so glad i finally gave ! i 6 cats , all which loved water fountain ( i afraid some would not take it -- but they all ) . now , they all come running when i fill up resevoir or clean unit . my cats drinking more water than ever -- which we all know good their urinary tracts . some reviews say it requires too much cleaning -- well think all gunk your pets could ingesting ! i take unit apart once week give it thorough cleaning ( including pump which sometimes get blocked cat hair ) . i also change filter once week -- but remember , i 6 cats , so less pets , filter should last much longer . other than , i fill reservoir once day ( i since learned this thing goes through water really fast , probably due evaporation , so buy biggest one you get ) . it best investment i've ever made my pets	1

this insulated wine tote over top . excellent construction . two way zipper , nice shoulder strap , etc . picture not it justice . one side bottle wine other side contains two plastic wine glasses , bottle stopper even very corkscrew two small napkins . if you want take two bottles , just remove wine glasses . however , if you're taking white wine you want keep very cool , i suggest purchasing inserting some those small freezer paks starting out very cold bottle .	1
