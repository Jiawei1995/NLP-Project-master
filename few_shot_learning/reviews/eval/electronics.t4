this great card reader price . why pay more if this one reads all cards you ? personally , i only use compactflash sd cards . it reads these cards it it fast reliably . shape this card reader bit awkward but then again it help you grab unit while inserting removing cards , which you'll want bit carefully . it would bit more difficult unit lying flat desk . remember never force card remember label side faces towards sandisk logo card reader . it slightly tricky get cards into slots first , but once you get feel it , it beccomes quite easy routine . this sandisk led indicators helpful . one amber led tell you unit connected your usb , other green ones each card slot let you know either you card insert ( solid green ) , or it reading or writing ( blinking green ) . this card reader comes 1 year warranty i feel it represents good value . i would recommend it	1
i used 25 pack these doing dvd backups , last 5 or so failed . i thought it my software , so i got new software . guess what ? my first disc out new package 25 i bought failed , too . it not my burner ( reviewer suggested , implying people should learn read ) , it brand new doesn't require firmware upgrade they mention . they just suck high failure rate . so consensus seems tdk or sony best . i'm buying some now save myself frustration	-1

i ordered this television high hopes , knowing despite reports firmware problems other defects i would luck out save bundle . but you get what you pay . every sharp aquos lcd tv manufactured before april 1 , 2006 shipped bad firmware . what this mean you ? me , it meant 15 minutes after unpacking tv turning it , it turned itself off never turned back again . resets , system resets , power cycling , unplugging components didn't help . my tv completely bricked . search turned up threads websites like avs forum other owners sharp tvs d4u d6u series all reporting similar power management problems almost immediately after purchase . them , fix visit sharp authorized service center either firmware replaced or physical replacement boards inside tv . i say " visit " because sharp not cover in-house technician visits tvs under 32 " , fact they could informed me before letting me wait 1 week tech visit would ultimately canceled . so here i am , 10 days later hundreds dollars poorer no tv show it . instead , it sits authorized service center ( because sharp obviously not vet its service centers make sure you get good service them either ) . i'm willing bet all inventory d6us tigerdirect selling fire sale prices produced before 4/1/2006 . check serial number your tv if you order one . if it begins 501-512 , 601 , 602 or 603 , immediately demand firmware upgrade sharp ( 1-800-be-sharp ) , regardless whether or not you're experiencing these issues ; you eventually , hopefully while sharp warranty still effect you .	-1

i bought this alarm clock today ( april 7 , 2007 ) bed , bath beyond $10 . i wish i seen reviews first . i bought it because product name , small size variety options . unfortunately , i realized it wasn't great buy when i brought it home ... spent few hours trying keep battery certain position so clock would stay . connections appear very sensitive battery doesn't stay place . clock light pointless . it supposed help you see time dark , but unless you clock certain angle everything appear blurry . actually , screen blurry most positions even light off . alarm , it pretty quiet . if you're sound sleeper or live noisy environment , this not clock you . you'll only hear alarm if you sleep it under your ear . final note this product : clock almost hour without any problems ... but only battery cover slightly open . if i close cover all way , clock shuts off . if you want alarm clock last awhile , i suggest buying something else . you get less than you pay this model .	-1

this keyboard folds out well i liked feel keys . however , ir connector needs direct connection ir port pda . ipaq , this port bottom handheld . 210 degree arm not rotate this area . order proper connectivity , you turn handheld its side . this then requires software program download ( not freeware i find ) rotate your screen landscape view , unless you read sideways without getting headache . before buying this product , check your handheld see if your ir port 4-8 o'clock - if so , this may difficult keyboard use	-1

if you want budget home theater system under $200 there probably not many systems better then sony ht-ddw700 . this system ideal small rooms such bed room or tiny living room . considering price , sound quality actually better then expected me . tiny cube speakers presents pretty good clarity . they may look like cheap computer speakers but they aren't bit heavier then they look . center channel may little underpowered since dialog during dvd movies sound tad soft little too low . surround effects during movies dolby digital dts very good though . if set up properly speakers handle surround effects very well . some minor complaints speaker wire attached speakers very thin . they fixed can't replaced . also , if you want heart stopping bass then this system might not you . 8 " subwoofer okay considering price system . it currently better then any other sub included home theater system under $200 . it isn't powered , very light ( only 9 lbs ) you pretty close actually feel bass . volume would cranked up extremely high sub actually rattle your walls . receiver comes 1 optical 1 coxial digital input 4 rca analog inputs . it should enough most cases . extra digtal input or two wouldn't hurt but again system under $200 . setup couldn't easier . you just hook up included microphone , place it your listening postion press button remote . system automatically sets up speaker distance , delay volume levels . receiver comes basic pro logic ii music move modes upmix your stereo sources . it also other sound fields effects enhace sound but they don't really seem enhance sound much if all . basically , if you want home theater system small room under $200 then there isn't much better then sony ht-ddw70	1

after doing fair amount internet research mp3 players their features i under impression i would go ipod . computer industry almost 15 years i never fond mac always little biased towards pc . this added my reticence own mac product growing complaints service ipod ' bit ' over priced i forged . i started reading through all reviews i could find internet always , found wealth them here amazon . my dismay all reviews i could find product names i knew absolutely trashed products they reviewing which scared me immensely . thats , until i got iaudio line . reviews almost all positive complaints present things i could easily overlook . i love control , i am big guy big hands i rarely , if ever , pushed control not result i intending . i my iaudio x5 over month i nothing bad say least . i am avid linux user it works flawlessly linux , sound quality phenomenal , except ear buds came mine lot static them so get rid those . fm tuner great ( you wont get ipod ) . i travel lot i pipe my x5 through my car stereo using cassette tape converter plugged into stereo out port . what else i say , this great product great features it looks good too ! i also bought case zcover which fits purpose but i think time goes some better more versatile cases come market . satisfied custome	1

i researched tvs long time before i ended up buying this set . it helped costco offered coupon $300 off price ($1000 final price ) . i thought i may not like tv , so i decided buy person opposed online help potential return . however , there no way i am returning this tv ; it awesome . picture great , just sd . strech feature makes regular 4:3 picture fit screen not look distored . i worried buying 37 " tv then watch black bars sides avoid distortion . but there no need this tv since sharp figured out how strech picture without distortion . dvds look incredible this tv well . what even better built-in hd tuner . i debating upgrading my cable hd package , but i decide spend $13 " rabbit ears " target . oh my , once i plugged indoor antenna let tv track digital stations i amazed . analog station popped up like fierce snowstorm winter , but when i went up hd digital companion station , i couldn't believe my eyes . incredible hd picture rabbit ears set my desk ... indoors no less ! why would i upgrade my cable tv hd package when they can't offer local stations hd ? especially when they free simple antenna ! i told this possible , but quite frankly i skeptical . not anymore , i am so glad i got sharp built-in tuner . i seriously considered just buying hd ready tv monitor upgrade through my cable provider . boy am i glad i didn't . if you market very nice tv easy use provides great picture , i would highly recommend this set .	1

edge 305 provides wealth knowledge , easy install , well use . i would love given it 5 stars ( it deserves them ) , but one thing not work correctly , really bugs me calories expended . it couldn't more inaccurate if they tried make it way . first day i installed it , i took it quick 1 mile test ride . it indicated mile i burned 100+ calories . wish it true , but it not . unfortunetly next day i going take it out 100 mile ride , but crashed i started out not riden since ( 3 days ) . i wore chest strap office today test calories burned further . after 2 hours it read 0 burned . i just took it car ride 7 miles . those 7 miles driven car , it indicates i burned nearly 600 calories , again i wish , but no way . other than flaw , whioh i hope they fix software update , i highly recommend this product , it all other ways it great	1

so this controller looked pretty sweet me so i bought it over rumble pad . i liked idea fans wicking away sweat , i tend get pretty white knuckled my controllers . i bought this controller specifically star wars battlefront 2 pc , it works like dream . i also like x-box controller layout ( offset anolog sticks more ergonomic ) than ps2 style controller logitech rumble pad . it also better grips than ps2 controller . only things i think bad it following : 1 . it not modeled large xbox controller , but rather regular one , which ok most people , but i big hands i get bit cramped up if i play way too long . 2 . i slightly dissapointed lack custimization software available this pad . i saitek cyborg evo joystick you create custom profiles every game you want use it then set profile before launching game . this isn't issue battlefront 2 since it very excellent game control configurator , but i could see where if game didn't good interface ( or maybe older games ) this pad could suffer this regard . 3 . this isn't so much issue me , but i would assume lot game play turning off fan , fan motor likely die sooner than pad wear out . i don't care too much , because fan more novelty me than anything . i still use it even if it die . overall , great controller , i actually would give it 4.5 rating , but isn't option here	1

when i first got wireless network home i purchased kensington wifi finder . it worked fine . but time went i saw these smaller versions come out chrysalis development . i heard they more powerful more versatile . so i bought one . i not disappointed . since it same size my keyless entry remote my car , it fit perfectly my keychain . also it much longer range than others . but best all , it directional . meaning i simply turn my body while holding down button leds change instantly signal strength increases or decreases . what great product . i love it !	1
i purchased this gps back april 2006 very happy it since . it not perfect , but you remember this not dedicated street navigator or hicker gps , it hybrid two there compromises . car : it accurate maps routes quickly 90% time . other 10% time it either looses signal , outdated maps ( my update ordered it way i type ) , or just slow processing some reason . this 10% time i'd say only 2% time this actual problem me . rest time i able simply guess what i needed next or it didn't matter all . i not found perfect way fixing slow route calcuations , but vast majority time this hasn't issue . foot : one features sold me this fact it long lasting battery it waterproof . both qualities needed used hiking . only catch you turn off lock roads , otherwise you get some really confusing directions ! also it difficult program destinations coordinates opposed addresses , but it ( put address then change everything including coordinates confirmation screen before hitting route ! ) . boat : haven't tested this i don't boat , haven't purchased water based maps . overall i'm very happy this looking forward map update . i wish it little faster route calculating map drawing , it easier imput exact coordinate points . it still better than buying/lugging around 2 seperate gps systems me	1

i've held off reviewing this item until i actually got some alerts - i got plenty them over weekend , so here it .... there seem lot complaints this hard set-up - so many , after no problems setting it up myself , i'd worried i'd something wrong . over weekend , number thunderstorms tornados rolled thorough my area - using s.a.m.e alert system my county - i received notification each warning . i purchased this radio specifically s.a.m.e alert system , living central mississippi , we get tornado warnings all spring - i didn't want 2am alarm tornado 3 counties north me . my one beef unit radio reception - even included external antenna , it spotty - especially weather radio reception . i'm not sure how far i am nearest weather radio transmitter , but living suburbs madison , i can't too far . if you're rural area , i'd definitely look into getting external antenna ( it port better external antenna than telescoping antenna included )	1

although i prefer akg k701 most my listening , this competing entry beyer so close it almost coin toss . ( one recent comparison headphone artcle came up dead heat . ) this surprising , considering dt880 one most reasonably priced major mid-priced headphones . bass full but nicely textured - not touch bass bloat found here . highs detaied never seemed sharp me , overall sound offers huge soundstage . instead music top your , these beyers lend perceived distance few feet ; ths makes classical music sound doubly elegant , surprisingly makes rock music grandiose appealing kind way . these headphones don't require headphone amp , but certainly profit one . 30 ohm version makes more volume , though 250 ohm version standard , best most daily listening . dt880 sounds great , but lacks tad k701 high-end sparkle . conversely , beyer value , comfort , workmanship can't help but impress . this phone labored under shadow akgs senn 650s , but listeners always impressed dt880s sound . it may your best value mid-priced , all-purpose headphone	1

i purchased 2gb elite pro sd card but found out my older simpletech flashlink card reader not able recognize card under winxp sp2 without most recent simpletech drivers . i don't card reader my computer , but pictures recorded it my digital camera viewed my pda so i assume it card reader . shortly afterwards , i also discovered kingston makes combo kit includes their usb 2.0 sd/mmc reader bit less price than card alone . i also noticed atp line 60x 150x sd cards . i no experience their products , but their sd cards potted versus placed plastic shell . they tout their cards more rugged waterproof . i'm very careful not any flash cards fail me , but rising capacities smaller form factors , i consider atp cards future .	1
logitech scored big plus this item . important thing you really need processing power device run properly . first review really unfair . logitech not hide fact you really should using nulooq g5 processor . it says so right box . i'm using it g4 1.8 ghz i feel i'm behind bit power . review nulooq g4 800mhz ludicrous . course it won't perform rigid standards todays graphic professionals underpowered box . hook this thing up your updated mac you'll see it shine . my workflow streamlined i enjoy more tedious tasks more than i ever . good job this one . i recommend it highly	1

when i started looking mp3 player my main concern ability play songs very high quality level . ipod consideration , top rated sony mp3 player . however , i didn't want get what everyone else after bad experience unnamed sony game console , i thought i would try something new . if you asked ten people who cowon , i would say probably nine ten couldn't tell you . it very sturdy same general shape/dimensions ipod . clearly designed compete apple , iaudio x5 some very valuable aspects : -superb sound quality , especially something weighs under 8 oz . ( i am currently using full size stereo headphones because they more comfortable)-rugged all metal construction overall great feel-simple design intuitive joystick/buttons ( i found joystick quite easy use after 10 minutes ; converts ipod may take some getting used to)-a plethera options : mach3 bass , surround sound , pan , wallpaper , 5 band equalizer , fm radio , voice recorder , surround sound mp enhance-the ability play video-a 14 hour battery 3 hour charge time-very powerful , i normally listen level 20 or less 40 volume levels it-priced same equal or lesser mp3 players-extremely easy program use transferring any type file iaudio . it drag drop system ; it took me seven minutes transfer all my 3.5 gigs music . -everything you need included box - earphones , usb 2.0 transfer cable , cable , 4 port attachment bottom player , charger jetshell software-great storage space ( 20 gb ) which used store much more than mp3s there some negative attributes iaudio x5 however : -the most glaring problem i in-ear headphones ; they not fit all way more than uncomfortable . they also assymetrical length cord . i consider myself average size ear canals so i imagine this major problem other users . i suggest cowon completely redesigns these . -because brand widely unknown , price may scare some away even all features reviews . -no place online buy mp3s particulary this player ( however i read somewhere there would soon one just like itunes . ) this my first mp3 player i am extremely happy purchase even price , because i would rather pay more quality . iaudio x5 all around outstanding media player i believe start make name itself once word gets out . if i rate everything came box i would give it 9.5 out 10 because earphones . other than this mp3 player close perfect .	1

well , i ended up buying mine closeout radio shack $149 .. i love mine ... sound really great , price awesome ! i use mine dvd , my tv regular sound all tv i watch , also tuner listen radio/ cd surround sound . some buyers talked whine speakers ... i don't know if this helps or not , but i share- i extra wire bundled up speakers i not put all wire anywhere near speakers or head unit . i thought bundle wire near speaker might cause interference , so if you whine , make sure extra wire not near equipment . mine not make any noise standby , or skip all either . i am very happy mine .	1

okay , this not review product itself . but , i stronglyencourage you consider not getting n.e.w warranty . they arereally not business fix things but make money not fixing things . if you anything device not working ( e.g. you dropped it , forget it they aint gonna fix/replace it whatever . ) they very sparce network repair companies so if there no one who fix it your area you ship it them virginia(of course you pay shipping ! )lastly , they tend screw over their repair companies so some cases they refuse repair items covered under n.e.w warranty or they take forever repair it since they know n.e.w take months pay them work they . if you want nightmare warranty then all means go it	-1

i real excited when saitek came out black eclipse . it matches my blue copperhead pretty well , but tarantula perfect . it built gaming . it like they looked standard keyboard said , let make it look cool - so they made it black , gave it nice design , added backlight . ok , where saitek ended . razer goes make removable keys , 10 extra gaming keys swap out ( fps ) , macro functionality built , hypersensitive buttons give faster response time , far better multimedia button set than saitek . additionally , completely backlit keys like saitek contributed glowable keys stripping their paint . razer longer lasting regard . tarantula cons , price . buy it if it must fit your beautiful computer . it tough , innovative , well designed . gj razer	1

minor problems , but very good so far . zire71 , moved up little . this one should shrine built if it ever dies . syncing , use avantgo free service all news , sports , magazines like cnet , pcworld , rollingstone , yahoo , bloomberg , seattle pi much more . syncs addresses calendar using outlook its main database . patience bonus ; when putting videos it , it take up 15 minutes or more . music bit faster , real takes care all . camera very low quality , washed out , poor resolution , poor definition edges , blurred . hard shoot good one , but sometimes ( rarely ) it okay . expect lot touch up when you download pics onto your pc . videos washed out , sound quality okay , distorts badly high volume , like idling hotrod 20 ' sounds like pure static . but camera very handy if you left your digital camera home . i.e. car accidents . voicenotes hangs computer when syncing , i don't use vn anymore . realplayer works great , sound quality excellent sony earbuds . 150+ songs , 60+ pics 30+ vids 1mb sd card w/360mb still free . mediaplayer works great , just drop videos onto desktop converter into palm they go . longest video i it 10 minutes . wifi would nice but that available different model . maybe card coming . software little disjointed , would like databases calendar tie together better . it could benefit lot more automation . calendar invaluable , haven't missed birthday , anniversary or important biz meeting yet . contacts uses outlook its server . windows apps documents-to-go makes it completely win compatible . freezes crashes probably 10x 2 years , up running seconds after reset . far fewer problems than my buddy $500 win handheld . he often must redock reload all his software contacts . huge problem when you're not near your pc , totally cut him off one time , no contact info . see quirks below . age battery may pushing 2 yrs old , battery life down 5 days off charger . durability no glass screen break like old series . bounced off cement floor shirtpocket more times than remember . screen covers must . keep forgetting remove pocket while sandblasting , powerwashing , walking work rainy days . sand once wedged sd card inside , pulled it out needle nose pliers , surprised it still works . power washed entire side building it pocket , set it sun dry it out , still works fine . ( it dripped when held end ) often gets rained when walking work , set it pc monitor dry it . puppy chewed it once , after repeated freezes , hangs , weird buttons pressed during setup ( when i didn't press them ) , figured out front cover teeth marks pushing hard enough touchscreen palm thought i pressing entries . bluetooth , works advertised . setup little goofy , but got it . quirks watch out crumbs , crud dirt ( teethmarks ) screen front fascia , crud press touchscreen cause all kinds weird startup freeze problems . i buy one when this one dies	1

my wife came up idea placing all my dvds binders ... i rejected idea first , but then saw her point how our family room started look like video store . now our shelves more space doesn't look so awkwardly colorful -- binders actually match color scheme our house ! i know other review mentions binder doesn't stay closed , but that only if you fill each page two dvd discs -- meaning every dvd other reviewer two-disc set . if you fill binder up its capacity , i see happening -- but if you just your average stack dvds , this product you ! best thing these binders : it highly unlikely anyone ask borrow dvd -- especially those " never-bring-them-back " friends ! without covers , they can't!five star product ... all way	1
this product simply not work . i purchased this item month ago back up my software my old pc ( because i buy new pc ) . after backing up all my photos , music , files extra using trusted drag-n-drop method it seemed though files loaded successfully hard drive . i restarted my old computer verified files drive . everything seemed ok . i then went my new computer upload files but it said files didn't exist . it panic time ( because i already reformatted my old compuer ) so i just lost all my files . i went wd support i told only back my files up using their software called retrospect . if i used drag drop , then who knows what happen . i enraged . external hard drives supposed simple , like portable usb drives , but wd made simple process more difficult it needs . i never recommend or buy western digital product again	-1
it doesn't really work . i mean , unless you're call center lined side side . but if you're office setting , nope . doesn't work . i wanted use this so people passing wouldn't really see my screen . there screens this , but not this one ! while filter nice eyes , way it places screen beats those big clunky guys hang monitor ( plus it subtle ) , i'd trade all this it actually working	-1

i really enjoy idea this item it definitely save some careless people headaches . however , i two macbooks my home gone through six these adaptors eight months , which breaks down 1.33 month ! cords consistently separate connecter . i suppose if your laptop remained desk you didn't travel lot it'd last longer . they need reinforce wire where cord adaptor tip meet . i would not buy one these extra one , because it highly probable you'll issue if you buy them over counter you only get 14 day return policy . least macbook purchase it covers you one-three years depending if you bought applecare .	-1
i owned this tv few weeks very pleased it . only complaint i internal speakers not powerful . normal viewing it probably very good . groups or people watching sports , etc . or room higher noise levels .... you really need external amp speakers . output tv not volume controlled or amplified so external speakers aren't enough themselves . again , very happy picture , tuner , etc . actually , it auto-tuned/setup digital channels through my normal coax-cable without digital box my cable company . this pleasant surprise . i pay hd my cable company so signal sent my home but surprised i didn't need digital box them well .	1

this product works ok basic gigabit switch . it looks very nice home office , not get hot . however , i bought it not nice looks , but looking great functionality . unfortunately , it turned out nothing but trouble . gs608 advertised support jumbo frames ( packets size big 9kb - 6 times more than standard packet 1.5 kb ) . properly configured network clients jumbo network easily reach transfer speeds up 80mb/sec more . but standard packets network barely work up 20mb/sec . so , this switch certainly work faster than old 100mbit switch , but hardly 2 times fast , when jumbo frames it would 8-10 times faster . when i noticed gs608 supports jumbo , it huge factor me go ahead purchase it . i wish i knew it all marketing lie ! upon receiving product i so excited so i disposed packaging ( i know - stupid me ) , only find out day later jumbo not work ( i am senior network engineer , i use jumbo work great success more expensive switches ) . so i could not return or replace product , my multiple calls netgear support resolve this very frustrating led nowhere - they just could not ( or rather would not ) understand what i am talking . so i am stuck now basic gigabit switch , when similar model ( not even pretending support jumbo ) could bought much cheaper other vendor who not false advertising . you decide yourself	-1

microsoft wireless optical elite less than satisfactory purchase me . although i like feel keyboard , i am still trouble getting used layout , found it easy hit thumbwheel left side , causing screen scroll unexpectedly . i've found placement layout group buttons right main keys , containing delete , pageup pagedown buttons , particularly troublesome : i always seem hitting wrong key , sometmes brushed delete key while typing , usual unhappy results . driver constantly telling me i low signal strength , even though wireless receiver within 2 inches keyboard . replacing batteries not helped . i've also found it tends skip characters while typing . mouse bit better : it feels comfortable works expected , no surprises . all all , although better than keyboard my laptop , this not product i recommend , particularly given price . some lower priced wireless microsoft keyboards used friends family seem work better , laid-out better , than this " top line " model .	-1

i bought one these circuit city $99 . i live st. pete/tampa area . auto station find not very effective . i found clearer ones manually searching . when it connected your ipod , it definetly slows down menus . buttons icarplay 200 also very unresponsive . i would press change station button , nothing happened , then press it again , then it would jump twice . so my advice patience when navigating icarplay menus . sometimes i could get it work acceptable amount static , but then unit would randomly stop working , i get blasted noise my radio cranked up . you cannot adjust volume icarplay , only your radio . i returned unit , i am process getting pioneer head unit built auxillery input front panel . i cannot recommend this unit . it also looks cheap price point . it looks like it should cost $25 dollars . one postive note , it charge ipod fairly quickly . also my wifes car , where she factory stereo static wasn't quite annoying . i amplified tweeters which pick up everything , including static . i also thought putting unit closer stereo would improve sound , oddly it doesn't seem make difference . you could also look one wired ipod adapters such pioneer cd-ib100 ipod adapter .	-1

i waited until i finally received working model post my experience logitech . first , let me begin saying now i working audio station i really love it . product deserves excellent ilounge review it received . sound great . it audio port s-video out port back . i cannot life me understand why there $300 units made apple bose nothing more than some speakers . additionally , am/fm tuner works well . i really only use fm tuner but found it good - better than i expected but not perfect . however , once again , most units this price point not any sort am/fm tuner sacrifice i not willing make . all these reasons i really like audio station . however , if there even product market these characteristics ( am/fm , s-video out , audio ) i would taken my business elsewhere second . my experience logitech terrible . first , i brought home unit best buy early february found it one bad batch went out best buy stores ( see other reviews this page more details which units problem buttons not responding ) . after buttons front unit didn't respond i got online read reviews posted here amazon well logitech own website where they finally admitted this flawed product . i then contacted logitech see product sent me part warranty . representative logitech told me i would better off taking my unit back best buy . i realized i knew more problem audio station than customer service rep after only 20 minutes poking around online . i told him apparantly bad batch went out best buy stores last thing i going waste my time returning product best buy only bring faulty unit back home . i also told him i'd read audio stations coming directly factory reportedly working fine i wanted one those . after some time phone we arranged my unit picked up then i would receive new unit 10 days . 10 days later i called . this first time i found out unit out stock my order backorder . i furious i call find out item backorder . not only this first i heard problem but there nothing they could me . i told first week march they would recieve some warehouse . i waited . 8 days into march i called again . order hadn't made it warehouse . small order due arrive but it not guaranteed i would get one them . again , i very displeased but there nothing i could . this first time customer representative seemed know what he talking actually served advocate me . their credit , i recieve unit out first batch . it arrived relatively quickly works fine . however , it terrible , terrible experience way . if you buy one these , i guarantee buying directly factory . logitech not seem inclined recall their bad units appears content letting customers deal their problem . if you buy best buy or amazon , careful - you may receive one flawed units who knows how long it take replacement get you . it basically took logitech 7 weeks get me new model . i've never so much trouble giving company $300 my money . i plan never shop logitech again	-1

these speaker stands ok . they're solid seem well built . my only problem higher you extend them , more prone they leaning . not big deal , you just adjust center gravity your speaker . i would've given stands 3 stars but i gave them 4 because they're such good relative value . speaker stands so overpriced . that what i like these : you don't feel like you're getting ripped off . just don't expect super high quality .	1

hi there , i am writing this review after used product almost 2 months now . moment i bought my macbook , i looking case would protect my macbook without sacrificing it look . very reason many people buy mac it beautiful design who world would want spoil look how would you actually without hurting it day day use ? voila ! i came across this product . case pretty hard plastic some nice cuts gives good grip while holding/carrying macbook . it covers macbook completely top bottom openings sides different ports . there fin like openings bottom case heat dissipate . way you wouldn't worry macbook overheating . only thing bothers me this product once you put it your mac , it difficult remove it . i sometimes feel i might damage egdes when trying open . this may also because i am not doing it right way ;-) but anyways , i would recommend this product any macbook lover wants protect it scratched or damaged . lok	1

... system my computer pda ( dell ) because whenever i use " full base " preset mode my winamp listen pop songs ( just test bass ) such thongsong sisqo my hump black eyed pea bass became extremely gargled ruffled unclear . but when i sacrifice bass setting more flat setting it sounds great . my boyfriend computer , though , it worked fine ( gateway tablet pc ) so i am thinking it not headphone problem bass but rather , sound card my systems . nonetheless , after trying this one , shure e2c-g , etymotics er6i , i think sound system this set somewhere shure etymotics all levels ( lows , mid-range highs ) . shures , i found awesome bass , but lacking clarity mid higher notes ( i am no audio expert so please take this grain salt ) while etymotics almost no bass me ( i am not bass head either since i enjoy classical music , techno ( such taq ) video game/anime music ) when i tested bass thongsong sisqo my hump black eyed pea , but little too high pitched hurt my ears . this one seems smoother , in-between sound , but order give you guys better idea i'd probably need invest better sound system go it . i still wish it little more bass get " kick " my pop music when i listen hip hop rap . so far i think it keeper , though . i look forward wearing it airplane this summer way asia	1

before i bought this product i found it difficult find reviews nat . geographic topo state software well maptech terrain navigator software , so i am giving this input future customers . maptech provides demo . i'd say i prefer maptech 3d nat . geographic 3d version . nat . geographic provides more features such greater grid spacing options . but don't expect either print resolution regular 1:24 , 000 usgs maps ; both software brands default larger scale get kind resolution clarity least ink jet printers . national geographic topo 50% default setting results approximate print scale 1:31 , 000 which results very good clarity . however even 1:24 , 000 they legible ( although bit fuzzy ) . they both save you money verses buying regular topo maps ( after 20 or so store-bought maps considering your ink paper costs ) plus they give you advantages if you use gps unit especially overlaying grids , trail markers , etc ., printed-out maps . but don't forget it takes more than ( 4 ) 8 1/2 " 11 " printouts match one regular store bought 1:24 , 000 topo map	1

my epson printer finally broke down . physical damage not repairable . i wasn't particularly happy it nor price ink cartridges . i needed new printer fast . some searching internet came up canon ip4200 . i bought this printer amazon $62.00 including shipping . i thought it would cheap stop gap printer until i found good printer . well i don't continue looking . this printer it . it easy set up if you follow quick guide . i went ahead updated all drivers immediately , which simple easy canon web site . manual well written grammar correct , unlike many manuals printed overseas . first thing i print sample page . fast warm up , extremely quiet extremely fast printing . what beautiful copy . next i tried print couple photos using sample photo paper supplied printer . took minute print . prints look every bit good what i would get photo lab . very impressive . addition software very easy use . i not however install web print program , i felt i didn't need it . couple pluses- printer closes up when not use . this helps keep dust minimum . addition when printing it extremely quiet , particularly when compared my epson . big plus haveing paper cartridge which allows me keep letter size paper always ready use top auto feed open different size paper . ink comes 5 cartridges so you only replace one cartridge time . this may or may not cost savings . all all i am extremely impressed this printer . i owned computer printers since mid 1980 , everything dot matrix laser printers . i know technology changes but this printer far best i ever owned . i highly recommend this printer very small business , home based business or home use . you can't go wrong particularly inexpensive price . only fault , which i knew going into deal printer not come usb cable . i extras so it wasn't big deal me , hot swappable you probably one hanging around device . only other problem unlike my epson it not automatically tell me ink level . but minor nit pick . you tell i am highly impressed . lets just see how far ink goes . this printer a+ my book	1
previous model , 101 excellent pair headphones would only set you back ten dollars . sony replaced 101 110 . 110 same good quality sound previous model , but it smaller . even standing still , headphones slip off my ears causing me constantly adjust them . i don't know if it smaller size or angle headset , but fact it won't stay my head makes it totally worthless . i many other kinds headphones never run into this problem before , so it faulty design , not shape my head . i would stay away this model	-1
this seems great router ! it easy set up initially , enough bells whistles savvy people go ahead improve they're security later when they're ready . default setup quite secure , then , if you want poke hole through protection , you fine-tune it more , set it so someone could access specific port your system outside . speed-wise , it seems doing what it supposed , which arrange gaming packets pass through minimum time . vonage packets well routed , also . logs show how many attacks thwarted ... you won't believe how many " messenger " attacks there , plus attempts hacking into every port you imagine . this gives you good sense router doing its work admirably . add this pretty lights , you really great router ! ; -	1
i using canon i550 several years now printing calendars my family around xmas time . each calendar 13 pages i print 20 them ( 13 20 2 sides = 520 ) high resolution . i use lot ink canon cartridges easy refill . print head died i550 , so i searched new canon similar ink cartridges refill . several pixma series cartridges look same small difference they chip them . instead doing visual check cartridge determine if ink low , chip tells printer driver after so many prints . lame , but manageable ! i550 1200 nozzles ( if i remember correctly ) ip6210d 4800 ( again , if i remember correctly ) . anyway , i expecting prints much better than i550 . prints seemed same , so extra nozzles didn't seem make much difference . form factor same , but there lot more buttons features available . i don't ever print directly memory card , so lot features i don't use . i also hoping print speed borderless 8.5 11 prints i use calendar would faster . this printer doesn't seem print much faster than older canon . overall it good printer , but quality probably isn't much better than one lower end pixma printers	1
perennial favorite brother 1240hl works hard modest price fetches one these machines . one most important reasons i originally decided purchase this machine escape netherworld inkjet cartridges . rating 1.6 cents per sheet , not only you save money long run but you avoid scrubbing cleaning cursing every three months . some competitors cartridges fetch upwards 100$ this tidy component suits me fine often i get more than my 3000 sheet rating	1

short : don't buy pair these expecting use them next five years , they simply aren't engineered well ( details follow ) . buy them if you want cheap pair headphones easy carry around , comfortable , block outside noise , sound grea t.t he long : i've owned two pairs these headphones over past few years . my use consists primarily listening music . i'm not throwing them book bag every day , they usually stay home computer , except occasional road trip . second pair recently broke ( point where it not worth repairing ) , so i decided take it apart see if i should purchase third pair . said , here how they fail : 1 . ) volume control cord breaks , result , one or both speakers cuts out intermittently . eventually , there no sound all . this happens consistently . first pair , i tried soldering wires back -- this lasted few hours , until it broke again . problem weight cord pulls directly fragile solder joints -- they inevitably break off , no matter how gentle your daily headphone use . only solution cut volume control out cord tape wires back together ( i've this once each pair ) . unlike volume control , cord properly connected , requires great deal force remove it ( accidentally or intentionally ) . 2 . ) wiring headset breaks , right speaker works intermittently , then fails . this not yet happened my first pair , which i am still using ( albeit , taped-together state ) until i purchase new set headphones . i stopped folding/collapsing it try prevent it failing before i buy new pair ( not same ones , i've decided ) . headband , curved piece springy metal stuck two pieces foam-like material . this metal piece four holes drilled it ( very poorly ) , wire right speaker woven through these holes . result whenever you fold/collapse headphones , wire rubs against sharp metal edges , insulation wears away . eventually it cuts through wire ( which actually * taught * headphone extended-most position ) , it not possible remove replace wire without cutting re-sewing headband . wire i removed broken pair worn down bare metal all four locations where it woven . despite these engineering oversights ( failures ? ) , headphones last year before modifications/repairs required , sound above average ( bass actually pretty decent ) . they easy carry don't require very much power get loud . just don't expect miracles lt ; $30	1

our unit purchased replace 3+ year old garmin geko 201 geocaching . geko great , but tiny screen " shrinking " due my middle-aged eyesight . also , it getting very tiresome manually entering caches into unit . i considered cheaper garmin legend , but found display less readable than geko . also , it came serial cable , not usb , so i would buy adapter or expensive cable(s ) get it interfaced my notebook . word interfacing computer : prepared work bit accomplish this . usb cable came my sony digital camera worked fine . however , usb drivers garmin website not automatically install set things up . i run driver install executable , locate drivers , then manually run xp hardware install wizard point drivers . not too bad if you experienced , but might challenge if you aren't " techie . " i then setup configured " easygps " interface unit able load . loc files geocaching.com, we off races . this so much easier/faster than entering coords hand ! unit performed well our field tests . color screen bit harder read than geko bright sunlight . also , i found unit would " flip-flop " display when i standing still . no big deal , just start moving it settles down . many useful geocaching specific features . overall , i'm satisfied build quality features .	1

i bought this midi controller mainly playing virtual synthesizers , but uses it hardly limited . it works great so far , just plug it that pretty much it depending program . it very light slim , which makes it very portable . research i've , this seems new model replace oxygen8 , which very similar but lacks 8 programmable buttons slightly heavier . i would highly recommend this anyone who starting get into music production programs like reason , fruity loops , etc or anyone looking good little midi controller . this price you can't beat quality functionality	1
theory , you don't need this device . you've bought hdtv screen , it got input your existing dvd player , you'd think your swank screen electronics would good job dvd signal give you pretty good picture , but they don't . fact it looks worse than your old tv . ok , well , you've also got stylish new blu-ray or hd-dvd player . maybe problem interconnect your old dvd player . your new stylish hi-def dvd uses hdmi -- surely either screen itself or swank new dvd player make sure your dvd looks good your new screen -- but it doesn't , fact it still looks worse than your old tv . practice you really may not need this device . one scenarios painted above may true you . your display or your hi-def player good job taking dvd content upsampling it hi-def screen . perhaps there screens or hi-def players market today this , but i don't own one them . i state certainty base playstation 3 sony kdl46xbr2 not such products . play dvd straight xbr2 , or through playstation 3 xbr2 you want your old tv back . ( well , i . maybe anything looks better than your old tv . ) if , like me , you find your existing video library intolerable your new hi-def rig , then you should consider this player . like other reviewers , i am very pleased it . it makes content watchable . there two provisos . first , you read instructions . dv-981hd not automatically detect output your screen favorite format . read instructions , hit right buttons , or you not get any improvement because dv-981hd output 480p your screen it usual lousy job upconverting . second , no amount processing going take old 480p signal make it look good 1080p signal . you own casino royale dvd , you see it blu-ray store or buddy house , dv-981hd not going make up difference . reasonable expectations . this product good job making your existing dvds look pretty good your hd screen , but they still going look bad comparison right after you've finished watching some 1080p flick . that why you bought your swank new hi-def player first place . here net . if you existing dvd library you want view , not find your current gear produces good picture your dvds , you reasonable expectations what your dvds should look like -- then this player you	1

i work higher education within media services . i've contantly looking reasonable " clicker " control ppt . it easy find/replace aaa batteries first all . you use mouse function double click your file bring up powerpoint . once you're , you push side wheel start , flick it up or down navigate through your slides . then you just hold it down go back edit screen . i tested this laptops both xp 2000 , unit running under minute without me doing anything other than just plugging receiver . also , i wasn't sure when i purchased it but you reset ' id ' number avoid crosstalk units . i don't two yet , so i'm not sure if they retain their new ' id ' after unplugging ... most units i believe . only minor gripe you perform secret handshake activate laser pointer , but even pretty easy . great little device , nice carrying case , perfect price range	1
we spent 6 months trying decide if we would use portable player enough justify purchase , if so , which one buy . bittorrent user , i lot divx files already , so when i saw player capability this price , i pulled trigger . very good decision . we've using player heavily month now , we very satisfied , often wondering why we waited so long buy one . we got it before long roadtrip ( 7 hours each way ) , it made travel much more pleasant my 4-year-old . he actually looked forward getting back car so he could watch his shows ! i able fit 10 hours kids shows one dvd-r using free divx software player/burner windows . phillips portable played all dvds , dvd-rs , dvd-rws we've thrown it without slightest skip or freeze . i can't even say our full size home player . it feels very sturdy , held up perfectly so far even hands rather rugged 4-year-old . battery life very good , but i don't any specifics . longer than 5 hours , least , which seems good me . included adapters allow you use it plugged wall or cigarette lighter without battery attached if desired ( much lighter way ) . car adapter cord long enough reach dash back seat big vehicle , but probably not third row mini-van . screen not huge , especially when viewing 4:3 aspect content . 7 " diagonal measurement really only applies 16:9 ( widescreen ) content . built-in speakers ok sounding , suprizingly loud . there 2 headphone jacks , which outstanding feature so you don't use splitter . included av cable lets you hook it your composite inputs your tv or vcr , so you use this your home entertainment center . i considering buying both home divx player , car video system . this player satisfies both requirements much less than i planning spending either one . this qualifies best consumer electronics purchase i've made last 2 years -- very pleasant surprise	1

omg , i got these headphones they suck !!! i am not even kidding , they probably worst headphones world worst headphones i've my life ... first all , when you listen music there loud hissssss noise backround , second , these don't even fit over your freakin ears ... haha , also , they tooo bulky , you can't anything them ... sound quality ok ... but if your looking noise cancelling headphones , i dont recommend these , i recommend sony fontopia headphones or 120 dollar sony noise cancelling headphones ear buds not too bulky ( availible brookstones ) ... now those what you call great , these panasonic earfones just horrible compared these , it only takes out like little noise , but sony 120 dollar ones brookstone takes out 70% noise ! that amazing , it probably why they so expensive ... well i leave but this my advice you don't ever ever buy these headphones your life !!! they horrible !!! hope this helped	-1
this 32 " lcd aquos quite possibly best size/quality/price combination market . picture clearer than i could ever hoped , better than much more expensive ( heavy ) plasma screens . sharp also managed get close true black possible lcd , colors vivid true . setup couldn't easier , there more inputs ( 6 ) than most people devices input . importantly , there two hdmi inputs so digital cable dvd no longer make analog losses previous gold standard component inputs . hdmi , everything that digital stays digital , all one cable . plus your video games hooked up two component ( or two composite ) inputs . screen size , those tempted go larger should remember two things : 1 ) resolution 37 " screen same 32 " , resulting larger picture but one which more pixelated ; 2 ) picture so clear , you view screen quite clearly much farther distance than you would imagine . combine all this sharp emmy-winning pixel technology refresh rate only 6ms , opposed 8ms most lcds this range -- meaning virtually no lag even fastest action pics or sports events -- you tv virtually no flaws . two 10w speakers more than adequate until you get your optical dolby surround system set up	1

first rule microphones , " no one microphone perfect every purpose . " rule two , " experiment different mics different applications find your signature sound . " i've used shure sm58 their ancestors relatives back 1968 . i primarily used them broadcasting recording spoken word content but i used ( still use ) them singing some back up vocals . sm58 one thing well vocal performance when used very close mouth public address use . some people , me included , actually sound better more comfortable live performance setting when using mic , shure sm-57 . sm-58 very good vocal mic some people probably best choice . example , anyone who not resist putting mic right up against their lips while singing probably want sm-58 . people softer or weaker voices want sm-58 . sm-58 highly directional noticable yet manageable proximity effect ( which means bass increases closer you get . ) this mic not pick up well much over 8 inches away . reason so many singers think you supposed shove microphones practically inside your mouth because ball type shure vocal mics require you get them very close or they don't sound right . other hand , sm-57 sounds best several inches away user mouth works fine up 12 inches away . while sm-58 certainly number one professional pa vocal mic , there precious few other uses it because it colored sound prominent frequency response boost upper midrange plus sound source very close before it picked up clearly . it works ok conga drums like , but sm-58 last thing you'd want use mic sax or guitar . personally these mics not best my mic technique or basic nature my voice , but some people they sound great . live vocal mic works best me shure sm-57 windscreen . however other people sm-58 works better . it depends your voice what you want mic . if you very deep voice , sm-58 might second best choice after sm-57 which better low frequency response . one certain advantage sm-58 excellent gain before feedback capability . this mic turned up louder than almost any other mic without annoying pa squeal . advantage sm-58 it still available ( slight extra cost ) built-in on/off switch . sm-58 ball shaped grills very sturdy even if you should dent one you get replacement which screws right ten dollars . i've seen sm-58 dented , rusty , dusty , smoked up , spit into , pieces missing slammed into hardwood stage full weight boom stand adding mass fall yet i've never seen but one stop working malfunction due on/off switch got dirt it . all pro-line shure mics top quality . pro line shures also hold their value well . if you buy one decide you don't like it , you get what you paid it ebay . i would compare many mics possible before buying one . senneheiser evolution mics sound really good too worth look . sm-58 number one on-stage vocal mic forseeable future because most people follow crowd instead actually trying out different mics picking one works best their particular voice . these things so durable even if they stopped making them today they'd still around 20 years least	1

first off , i need let everyone know i ended up buying this tv local store not amazon . i'm writing this review because i used reviews amamzon help me make my buying decision am appreciative reviews other buyers during my research . bottom line , one other reviewer stated , you get what you pay . i took my three small children into local electronics store , while standing front wall tvs ( both plasma lcd ) , asked them pick tv best picture . not surprisingly , they all picked pioneer . anyone who kids tell you they really say what they think . tv best picture far . there no comparison lcd tvs either . don't let anyone try tell you lcd longevity or picture quality . i easily see pixelation fast moving images when i checking out 1080p lcds . there also alot talk concerning plasma burn-in issues . this may issue past but i've no problems all . during first 100 200 hours viewing , just go user-defined settings dial down brightness contrast . also , go power set " save2 " avoid stationary logos much possible . after this break-in period , you put settings whatever you like . absolutely five stars	1

i originally purchased 56 " samsung 1080p dlp ( hl-s5687w ) amazon . unfortunately , i one few who could see rainbow effect single chip dlp color wheel . rainbows very distracting i couldn't live set . amazon couldn't anything me such exchanging set different model . fortunately , samsung willing work me gave me option exchange/upgrade different set . i chose go hp-s6373 couldn't happier . i am really into picture quality , this set best i've seen anywhere . i 65 " crt rptv three half years , although it isf calibrated , samsung plasma looks much nicer . when i decided get new hdtv five months ago , i went through two sony 1080p sxrds ( kds-60a2000 ) , both ended up green blob problems . then i tried samsung dlp , which rainbow effect i mentioned earlier . i spent so much time researching hdtvs , sony samsung models i tried arguable two best sets available time ( i spent way too much time avs forum ) . anyhow , i am very happy samsung hp-s6373 . it minimizes two big concerns people plasmas - glare burn - using filterbright plus automatic pixel shift technology . you still see some reflection brightly lit room , but there no silk screen effect ( sse ) , which very noticeable sxrd dlp . i'd rather little glare instead sse . both sony sxrd samsung dlp 1080p sets . i understand why higher resolution important , especially 1080i/1080p material but i honestly tell you my 1366 768 plasma looks much nicer than either 1080p set . granted this may due my 12 foot viewing distance , but ultimately best picture up viewer 1080p sticker doesn't necessarily mean picture quality one set better than . i constantly found myself tweaking sony sxrd samsung dlp sets get best picture . i used service user menu tweaks recommended settings cnet avs forum , but never completely satisfied . hp-s6373 plasma didn't look so hot out box either , but after setting it movie mode ( no other adjustments ) , it looks amazing . it probably not completely fair compare rptvs plasma , but i am just providing my opinion based sets i've . reviewer mentions build quality leaves much desired . i haven't owned any other plasmas , but compared rptvs i've owned , this set pretty solid . tv level stand , so perhaps reviewer bad stand . only annoyance i set i hear slight buzzing noise when volume muted bright image displayed . i can't hear it where i sit haven't noticed it during normal viewing . i just read complaints buzzing some samsung 50 " sets , so i listening it . i get within couple feet set hear it , like i mentioned , it only audible bright images . compared much more significant green blob rainbow problems i previous sets - this non issue . sorry write so much , i just figured i would share my experience incase anybody else much trouble i've finding hdtv they happy . most people ( including my wife ) would completely happy sony sxrd or samsung dlp	1

this affordable microphone perfect complement my olympus ws-300 digital audio recorder . i took it me overseas reporting trip , it functioned very well . i used it settings both crowded noisy , quiet solitary . mike handled everything well . clip sturdy never caused problems during my two-week journey , which i used device nearly every day several hours day . wind guard ( small round styrofoam-type covering ) worked well dampening extraneous noise . it picked up primary speaker voice easily . when i worked translator , i clipped mike his lapel it able clearly record his voice . interview subject more difficult hear , but that expected . extremely long cord positive people using video equipment who want stand long distance away subject . otherwise , i suggest you keep wire tied up rubber band or provided twisty-ties . i can't comment battery life small watch-type battery that included . i also purchased cheaper lavalier mike ( no wind protection , short wire ) but i recommend paying little extra this higher-quality gear . it well worth your money , sound quality very noticeable compared my built-in olympus mike .

i bought this product my tivo it broke within few weeks . other reviewers said , rj45 connector incredibly fragile it really not question if it break but when . i recommend netgear fa120 instead . instead flimsy flip-up , you plug cat-5 directly into sturdy box , it puts less pressure tivo usb port . how big company like linksys , all it money brainpower , delivers such obviously inferior product beyond me	-1
lets face it , you're not buying nike + ipod its stopwatch feature , you're buying it all other wonderful calculations it . after couple weeks , system pretty much waste me . i wear sensor shoe pouch which designed sensor ( nike likely never make shoes fit my 10eeee feet ) . i read reviews shoe pouch system works fine . here some examples my results : 80 minute easy run , appx . 6 miles , system reported i run 1.26 miles . 25 minute easy run , appx . 2.5 miles , system reported i run . 21 miles . 2 times around same track , fast pace , system reported i run . 21 . 24 km ( same lane ) . nike admits system 10% off before calibration . i couldn't get it calibrate because it kept indicating i not gone far enough ( although i ) . nike + ipod forums , i've seen good deal complaining system often off 20 - 30% or more , even after calibration . my results seem much worse than average . i'm used good bit " odd behavior " electronics software , so i'm willing take good bit stride . nike + ipod , however , performed far worse than anticipated out box . me , nike + ipod essentially stopwatch linked my ipod nano ( which makes it good deal harder use than stopwatch my wrist ) , nice voice , give me feedback how much time i've running or how much time i left . since many nike + ipod website features distance sensor ( log your miles , challenge others , etc . ) those features worthless me . i'll still use it until battery runs out ; why not ? i'll glad update this review if it starts working better . but so far , i think two stars generous .	-1

excellent product , well worth money ! cons i've listed fact just minor irritations me , but certainly worth consideration anyone purchasing this product . pros : * faxing quality fast clear . * scanner quality very good . document scanning fast great clarity . * copy quality impressive . documents almost good original , document feeder you just walk away come back when job complete . cons : * i've hooked up my answering machine through mfc . due it answering every call check fax , it defeats caller-id function telephone which it connected . * power sucker ! this thing uses alot power it job . so whenever i send print-job mfc , lights dim momentarily . also , it draws too much power connected through my 1500-watt ups . * printed/copied documents come out recessed bay , which irritating trying fish out smaller paper sizes	1

i found really good deal [ ... ] this monitor , i say i no regrets buying this 22 " ' economical ' monitor ! i've looking large lcd screen while , but prices good 22 " monitors pretty steep , until i came across this one . monitor itself bright , crisp , clear option set it 1680 1050 ( looks ) fantastic ! i'm also gamer , so far games i played ( prey , rtcw , half life 2 , splinter cell ... etc . ) , all look great ! i notice " backlight bleeding " ( which everyone feels compelled mention ) , but that only when booting up or something requires dos mode , basically ... it really doesn't bother me all . bottom line , if you get this under $300 ( including taxes/shipping ) , then buy it !! it well worth it	1

i bought this cleaner replace old maxell manual cleaner served me very well . i doubtful it would work because price so reasonable . though it worked majority disks i've tried it , this cleaner lite users only . if you often encounter disks require more intensive cleaning , then skip this one . those lite users , i would recommend using spray glass cleaner rather than included spray . regular use this cleaner eventually required you purchase new cleaning pad . problem you'll buy entire accessory kit full things you most likely never need just get one little pad . i'm not fan hidden costs . honestly , i haven't found replacement pad pad yet i anticipate i'll eventually just throw whole thing away get cleaner . tadaaa ! now you're back where you started .	1

i purchased this clock replacement older timex travel alarm clock i lost . while this model functions basic level , it disappointing overall . reviewer mentioned , this clock gains time quickly . after just couple days it minutes ahead actual time . if you only use clock weekend trips this probably won't much inconvenience , but longer trips or regular use home , this bit nuisance . i honestly say my entire life i never any clock , watch , or other appliance so poor keeping correct time . i also disappointed quality indiglo backlight this clock . my last travel alarm , well my indiglo watch , indiglo backlight bright makes characters easy read dark . however , this clock indiglo backlight feeble comparison . it just bright enough qualify usable , but if your eyesight isn't great combination weak backlight fact you probably aren't wearing contacts or glasses middle night may make this clock difficult you read . far user interface concerned , time display very large , but other on-screen items , such " alarm " indicator , not necessarily obvious quick glance display . indiglo button , you see picture , middle face unit . my last travel alarm placed this button top unit . if you imagine trying illuminate your clock pitch dark room , you probably guess which location more convenient . fortunately , all buttons you need set clock easily located lower half face unit . setting time/alarm clock pair up/down buttons move time one ( if you press release ) or 15 ( if you hold ) minute increments . this particularly useful making small time adjustments backwards . overall i very disappointed this clock . it lacks some ease-of-use features i'm used , it suffers poor craftsmanship . it relatively inexpensive it hasn't technically broken , but if i could go back time i would most certainly purchase different travel alarm	-1
i just got cyberpad last week i used it few days . product just i expected , thin lightweight . software easy install although i agree earlier reviewer they could better job documentation ( fact they need correct major typos " manual " such change " lunch " " launch " ! ) . pen indeed bit bigger than what i'd like i hope they come up thinner replacement . notes captured very well eventhough my handwriting not very good ( specially fast paced meetings ) . me one biggest benefits evernotes software package which comes cyberpad . evernotes , i catalog organize all notes taken assign tags specific categories which makes it breeze find my notes later ( which problem i trying solve cyberpad ) . so , i would rank it 5-star except pen size	1

sonic impact t-amp amazing product , even more so considering selling price . it main selling point device enable portable music player play through small set speakers , but it also developed cult following among high-end audio crowd . more second . t-amp small , smaller than you would think looking photos , very lightweight even when loaded eight aa batteries it takes power it . two battery compartments actually take up most space inside t-amp case , amplifier itself so small if you placed it centered top standard business card you would still 3/8 inch border around all four edges ( yes , i this , measured ) . t-amp very simple operate . connect pair speakers terminals back , plug whichever music player you like into back using standard 1/8 inch stereo plug , turn it you listening music ! black circle front case t-amp only control , which both power switch volume " knob " . knob actually flush front case , which makes it easily operated your thumb , feel perfectly natural ipod owners . there also provision external power supply back used ac adapter . t-amp run long time battery power , most people skip ac adapter . couple potential drawbacks , which minor enough considered " nit-picky " , speaker terminals only accept bare wire , it needs fairly thin ( 18-gauge ' lamp cord ' would pushing it ) , people expecting t-amp very loud may disappointed . 15 watts rated maximum output , so expect it able deliver 8-10 watts real life . sound : better speakers you plug into it , within reason , more you expect blown away quality sound . if you efficient loudspeakers , 90db or higher , t-amp fill medium-sized room wonderfully clear , detailed , undistorted sound unless you try push it past it power limit . i said earlier , this little amp developed quite following audiophile crowd , group not impress easily , especially something sells this cheaply . understand , we talking people who won't bat eye spending hundreds dollars one set interconnect cables , not mention what kind money " good " ( their definition ) amplifier cost . yet , many these same people posted bulletin boards all over internet singing praises t-amp , comparing it favorably high-end amps selling over 100 times cost t-amp . yes , 100 times . i am musician training/trade , i also work repairing high-end audio equipment . i skeptical first all hype audio discussion boards , but i figured 30-or-so dollars wasn't too much spend satisfy my curiousity . i amazed what i heard first time i tried t-amp . it good enough people may want careful what signal they feed into it because , most part , what goes into this thing definitely going come out louder other end . if you never able tell difference sound high-bitrate mp3 low-bitrate mp3 same song before , you able t-amp . fact , you able tell difference high-quality cd player " normal " cd player playing same disc . it good . t-amp built tripath t-series amplifier chips , success t-amp caused higher-end audio equipment manufacturers take notice . it not uncommon now find higher powered versions t-amp chip selling stereo amplifiers costing well excess $4000.00 . if you decide try one , you won't disappointed , unless you wanting something insanely loud .	1

i've owned many supposed " universal " remotes over years - they all disappointed one way or several . my needs fairly simple ... device turn on/off amp , tv , cable , vcr , dvd cd players . also duplicate many their separate functions . this surprisingly inexpensive remote it all . functions it doesn't duplicate automatically , it learn other remotes . it also learn operate series commands push one button . instructions fairly easy understand , i am completely satisfied . i never would imagined such cheap device could operate so comprehensively . i'm very grateful other reviewers here rating this so highly . i probably never would considered this one my own , their recommendations saved me good bit money	1

first off let me tell you what equipment i'm running it . it basic set up :d lp tv , sony dvd player , directv dvr , pioneer receiver . hdmi only running dvd v.v ery basic . first all programming via web breeze really . no hangups so many mentioned . i 20 minutes . basically long you get names model numbers your equipment you ok . i called direct tv get exact model number my dvr . after programming , oh i dsl internet , so it wasn't slow , remote immediately took over my others . it worked right off . some mentioned syncing problems . if you don't leave remote facing devices long enough when you use activity selections(watch tv , watch dvd , listen radio etc . ) then sometimes it turn first couple components not other , but help function quickly takes care this . you also get it all back synch if you simply press device button turn off other equipment then start new activities button again . i haven't really problems reading screen many mentioned functions pretty easy come soon you get used layout remote . it turns itself off after two hours non use when you pick it up it turns itself back . reason behind this particular remote purchase me ease set up activities buttons layout . i wanted something would user friendly so when i someone watching my house they could easily perform basic functions system like watching dvd without hitting wrong buttons messing up presets such receiver or things like tha t.t he only reason i don't give this five stars remote feel bit fragile side if you kids i could see them dishes out some mean punishment this thing . instance if you press soft number buttons harshly they get stuck under casing . this happened once . not big deal but still . i would say this not child friendly remote let them use ones came devices instead . other than . great product so far so good	1

i tried this out slim out my collections which grown too unweildly , like many others here , i'm sure . :) what i really like these besides slimness how it locks . case lock really simple , two clicks corners slotted grooves edges . i'm fine this opposed those additional hinges which flip over edge . it not guvmint secrets locked away . i've dropped these accident , normal waist height , it didn't pop open . that all you really need . inside locking . i like this one very much well since it easy utilize . there ubiquitous circle middle , but right side , when you push down center , it like opening box center edge moved away , disc free removed . otherwise , it stays nicely . i've transfered my normal dvd sleeves into slim ones shaving off 1/4 off left right . full width 10.5 " , so you play around your own which side dvd sleeve content you want keep . bear mind though keep titles spine , you let spine b/w 5 " 5.25 " mark . if anyone wants get me some birthday gift , aug 13th , feel free click my wish list . :) clear ones though , i don't know why coloured or black ones more expensive . it doesn't matter , i've got sleeve artwork inserts them , ones i use my productions , clear ones allow additional space info artwork around disk edges	1

i use this xbox 360 gaming computer graphic work . first off , it 1 1 pixel mapping , which means , your picture complete down exact pixel . hardly any monitors this feature this screen size . ones nearly double price , even then there only 3 models i know , 2 them around $2000-$2500 , other around $1800 . back 12/06 . what this means under grand , i beautiful 37 lcd computer monitor , dwarfs my two samsung 20 inchers retail over $500 each ( because resolution ) . i deal colors fine image details , computer monitor , it unbelievably great . gaming ... i connect my 360 vga cable , set resolution tv 360 1080p voila . awesome . i just bought ghost recon 2 ( graw 2 ) , which supports 1080p . it beyond description . gears war beyond description even though it not 1080p game . if you wondering it affected my kills/death ratio graw ... they gone 10/10 15/5 . sometimes even 20/5 . you see enemies you would never able see regular screen . this only tv i know you get 1080p throug component cables . yes right . i've never tried it , but it supports it . ghosting ... i've yet notice it any game . speaking connections , this everything , vga , dvi , s-video , composite etc ., but only one hdmi . could problem when you get more than one hd device , but i wouldn't hold against this product . movies .. i not watched many it yet . not watched any hd movies it all . i can't comment , but i notice some motion blur close up man face when he interviewed during special feature " making star wars . " other words , it wasn't shot like normal moview would . i've never seen anything during normal scenes . picture quality nice , but i really can't compare it because i don't know what hd movies look like . put it this way , it plenty better than my previous tv movies . television ... it doesn't come tuner , but you get one your cable guy form cable box ( or satellite ) . i not watched any tv it . i can't give opinion . overall , this probably one best purchases i made long time . price , i don't think you go wrong . i am considering buying one so i dual 37 . screens , already would , but they jacked price up right after i bought it . bottom line if you looking gaming tv , this it hands down .	1

when you move significantly above $100 mark headphones , one naturally expects superior sound build quality - things found competing phones like grado sr125 , alessandro ms1 , or even sony mdr-v6 . one thing , body these headphones made relatively flimsy plastic , lends little way confidence product . sound - part matters - may impress neophyytes their strong bass , but balance richness tone sorely absent . perhaps that why may triport owners find themselves defecting other products . bose earned name through aggressive advertising name recognition , but if you're savvy shopper ( willing look some superb competing headphones ( sometimes half price ) , you your music better place	-1
listen up !!! these babies some best my experience , which rather limited . i say , though , i've heard some things songs i didn't realize there , instance : song , " downward spiral , bottom " , nine inch nails off , " further down spiral " amazing song anyway , when i heard it through these phones , i heard sounds coming , not only my right left , but underneath me , within my head , well undefined place away me . it weirdest thing . course those sounds came me right left , but headphones brought out those strange dimensions music . all frequencies superb , bass full . good metal , country , really anything not too soft , it open design , so real quiet music tends drowned out outside noise , like my vacuum . one caveat : cord substantial , 10 feet long . i would rather 4 foot cord or so , but that simply because i use it my portable , not my home stere o.o verall , very good comfortable headphones . get ' em !!!	1

sport bose bashing aside , keep mind these relatively small enclosures two 2.5 inch drivers crate rear sound stage much larger than their size might suggest , so without overly fussy placement . there always seems someone out there who sets their surround settings " large " , pumps up bass , then complains two 2.5 inch drivers small vented plastic enclosures " no lows " , sound distorted . neither vcs 10 center channel or 161s play ear-busting levels -- trade off small drivers small enclosures , theatre surround settings bass management must set accordingly . doing this , bose 161s ( especially when paired vcs 10 ) produce clear focused dialog convincing surround effects smaller rooms . you " better " ? sure , larger enclosures , bigger drivers play louder lower but doesn't mean bose don't deserve consideration basis good performance given their style size . if you throw little money issue want really exceptional performance relatively small speaker enclosures , consider legacy audio victoria speaker system very good multi channel theatre amp separate processor like those offered adcom or parasound .	1

last reviewer stated center channel speaker " barely audible " speakers " sounded horrible " . there nothing wrong these speakers . they made high-quality components probably your best bang your buck . first , first reviewer probably trying listen stereo sound through his surround sound system . reason there very little sound coming through center channel probably because receiver makes center channel phantom channel , where left right signals stereo sound combined put through center " filler " speaker . or ... if reviewer hooked up his dvd player receiver using just two rca inputs , he get stereo sound here well , even though dvd encoded dolby digital surround . receiver try make stereo sound into surround using dolby prologic surround when given stereo inputs , this less-than-digital performance , sometimes needing some extra tweaking receiver order get ample dialogue . bottom line : everything depends receiver connections you using your dvd player receiver . if receiver not quality , it may not put enough power into speakers , or it may put unclean power speakers causing them distort . if you not using digital coaxial cable or optical cable your dvd player your dolby digital receiver ( make sure it decoder ) , then sound most likely stereo sound synthesized into doly prologic surround , which simply mixes channels into center , where some dialogue could lost . if you right equipment you know how set it up correctly , you love these speakers	1
i bought 10-pack tdk tapes april , 2005 - boxes say : " tdk - superior quality - standard t-120 " - " vhs standard grade " - " videotape everyday repeated use recording " . tapes work so far , grainy blurry pictures colors not vivid sound quality horrible distorted . packaging not up amazon standards . video tapes not wrapped or protected inside box this probably why i least 1 broken tape ( plastic cassette broke off ) . they not protected box all . i'm very disappointed these video tapes . not sure if " tdk " going down hill or if all big name brand video suppliers lowering their standards . this first time few years i bought new vhs tapes they low quality i would expect generic no-name brand tape . since i need video tapes now , i forced order tapes other companies . i trying some other brands see if tdk standard tapes only brand name tapes lowering their standards . i'm going try some maxell rca standard tapes hope better luck	-1

truth , i'm cheapskate . this particular model happens cheapest they stock my local office depot , so i've kind loyal logitech customer years without particularly vested brand itself . first , good part : mouse very comfortable hand . while not ergonomic , it works perfectly if you mousepad built-in wrist support ( common freebie tech tradeshows -- testimony my cheapness ) . installation , there no installation -- plug it into usb port you're ! control good crisp . wheel gets job . it should also noted it doesn't come any bells whistles -- all . other mice multiple wheels , built-in scroll buttons special keys everything except fetch you coffee . this model only comes two buttons wheel , period , but if you're like me you'll just appreciate simplicity . bad news buttons wear out within 6-9 months . this especially notable left button , which gets most wear . 6 months , you start pushing only towards outer edge click register . 9 months , you press pretty hard . if you make it all way year , you're stuck hammering upper-left corner like madman every time you need click something . that only bad thing it though , price it easy enough up new one when old mouse starts showing signs wear	1

this tv incredible value ! i've owned it over 6 months never one problem . initially , i installed my subwoofer it , but sound speakers come set so good i rarely turn subwoofer . picture excellent all angles . people who see this always assume i paid much more it . yes , you'd probably get better paying 5 times this price ... but technology improves so quickly ( this one upgraded downloads ) , why pay more . i mine living room since i sit closer tv there . my bedroom , which larger i'm further tv , i'd probably go up next largest size . i love this one lightweight enough move ease ... myself . it world improvement if you still watching tv one those large square box , heavy weight tvs . price low enough when new technology requires me replace it , i'll feel if i've gotten great value money spent move next upgrade	1
we got this bedroom tv so we could watch dvds together after kids go sleep , it fantastic ! there essentially no setup , plugged it right directv receiver it looks great . we also got associated mounting arm easily mounted it wall giving us extra floor space . overall , this great deal -- this good size average bedroom . i think 37 " version this might overkill	1
i am using this my children cd-rom games . it also holds dvd cases nicely . my children 3 , 5 7 tend not put discs back when they them or can't find games they want play . this storage container makes discs easy find clean up . it also sturdy much nicer appearance than some other storage solutions . i leave them shelf it keeps things orderly while looking good	1

i like fact you could change fan speed . 2 available rpm choose , i use low browsing high gaming or when i'm defraging my hd . temp drop noticeable . some people mentioned fan noise bit loud . when you it high speed , fan noise noticeable but i don't think it bad . blue lights pretty nice too considering i white laptop it glows over my lid . definitely recommended people who would mind little fan noise not willing pay like $40+ cooler	1

i bought this memory my z610i sony-ericsson . when i first saw memory i could not believe how small it . it pretty small , less than finger nail it fast . i really like this memory it came all adaptors using it normal memory stick or sd . only thing not so cheap , i feel it could less expensive	1
i initially dismissed this product because it looked cheap , seemed priced accordingly . but after reading some reviews , i decided buy it risk whopping 24 bucks . it great buy . what it - it switches your vga monitor two computers , your usb keyboard usb mouse . it two buttons device control switching . it two usb ports go your keyboard your mouse . it three vga ports . one goes your monitor ( you use cable you already ) . two go your two computers . interestingly , kvm-to-computer cable , special cable included ( two them ) , also carries usb signal . cable splits computer end you connect vga connector usb connector their respective ports your computers . what it not - it not switch audio . it not designed switch additional usb devices , although it may work some devices not need high bus-power , if your keyboard acts unpowered hub . device itself powered computer usb bus it not separate power supply . this exactly what i needed . kvm stands keyboard , video , mouse . that all i wanted switch two computers ( mac linux pc laptop ) . i considered other kvm devices , they more features such audio switching special software , but they cost much more than this simple device . package comes software switching , but it windows only . docs say it hot key , scroll lock key hit twice succession , controls switch . however , it not work me , probably because my mac keyboard which not dedicated scroll lock key . however , device sitting next my keyboard , i just hit appropriate button ( 1 or 2 ) switch . it quite small . switching nearly instant . what could more simple than ? few things i tried ... it works fine 1600x1200 , 75 hz . my normally used mac resolution 1280x960 75 hz . my linux laptop old only externally output 1024x764 60 hz , which also works fine . i not see any degrading picture quality going through this kvm . my monitor 19-inch crt . summary , trendnet tk207k 2-port usb kvm switch works great great price . if simple two-way kvm vga/usb what you need , i recommend this one	1

i never give out 5 star reviews , because i never feel any product perfect , or complete . but i say , this definetely best ipod case out there . my first case agent 17 ( or it 18 ? ) ipod photo , which i " thought " i liked alot until i opened case found ipod screen all scratched . since i bought video ipod , i gone through least 3 cases , read extensive reviews least half dozen . what convinced me buy this these : ( 1 ) it currently top rated apple store , ( 2 ) myriad color options , ( 3 ) it belkin , which very respectable company , one first jump wagon ipod accessories since its revolution . i am glad i bought it , even though most reviews hint natural scratching outer case . well , i don't really care long ipod itself protected . that reason why i bought it first place . case comes ready both 30gb 80gb sizes ( they supply extra bigger back case 80gb , which what i ) . case fits perfectly , even protects wheel ( option not available most cases ) , there gaps every single outlet ( hold , earphones , dock ) so you needn't take ipod out unless necessary . color awesome , which tempting me go ahead buy case switch two . it sold via jr huge plus . their shipping time excellent . couple days latest . go get yours . you not disappointed .	1
i purchased my eton here amazon $99 received mine several weeks ago great anticipation . wait worth it , since digital tuning very good reception make radio well worth price paid . i own large collection shortwave radios feel this radio competes well some my classic 70s/80s era receivers which extremely selective cost more than eton/grundig hardware . only minor dig i cheap nature tuning knob desire venier tuning control . i fudge tuning bit fine touch , but it take some attention , especially some stations drift out . casual listening , this radio extremely stable very good field use trips . i fired mine up out box immediately impressed solid feel large high-quality antenna . leather grip heavy-duty feel more than compensate my tuning knob complaint i feel this unit competes well my smaller grundig radio sees active use when camping hiking . i am uncertain if am band tuned using ferrite internal antenna this model testing unit external antenna see if dxing am stations possible this model ... it probably standard ferrite antenna but it sure would nice find i extend function s350 this pleasant hobby dxing remote am stations . one other nice modification would eton evolve s350dl support simple circuit memory stations . it would logical thing would worth few extra dollars some more intelligence built into rig . overall , $99 i spent , very good deal radio i'll own very very long time . if this your first shortwave radio , it good purchase good introduction hobby	1

after jumping then off this system band wagon 40 times last month , my wife i finally decided get this system . when i decided i finally going break down get some speakers , cause ones my tv going out , i originally saw this system infomercial fell love it , just because it simplicity . after reading reviews online , i admit i leery it , since it didn't really shine some people . but after visiting factory store this last weekend las vegas getting hear this system , i realized what it , it outstanding . first all , if you wanting full 5.1 or 7.1 system , don't buy this . if you want run wires get true surround sound , this system isn't what you looking . know what you buying people . but if you looking adequate solution better sounding tv , games dvd , then this system you . these little speakers subwoofer able bounce sound off walls make you feel like you surrounded sound . we big living room this set up , it works great . 15 25 room vaulted ceilings , it still sounds great . we watch mission impossible ii our first full length movie it delivered like theater . we then put grand daddy tests me . jurassic park . t-rex scene clear loud scary ever . set up really easy too . took me 2 hours , but because i really careful keep my cords organized also really lazy not pulling tv out wall . dvd until runs well my direct tv xbox . i can't wait load up game see how sound . far regular tv viewing , we watched grammy last night , you could hear crowd noise like it around you , not just coming you . all all , this unit exceptional . what it , it great . true , it isn't same true surround sound system , but i don't think it claims . we bought this system starter , cause when we build new house we going run speaker wire true system them move this one our master bedroom future use . we used this 10 year old tv too , it like tv brand new . we plan adding 46 flat screen near future , so i only imagine experience get better . my recommendation , take these reviews ( even mine ) grain salt . try find factory store where you go hear them person , then come here buy if you want . they also great deals refurbished systems , which carry same warranty new systems . you save 300 bucks just buy one someone returned because they didn't like it get same warranty .	1

these great headphones . i am very picky sound but not want pay high prices . therefore there compromise , but not much . these sound great all types music go louder than many over head phones . i compared it 5 or 6 other headphones below $30 . i compared against jensen full size headphones i put aside comparing less than one minute . then i compared against phillips hsp2500 . [ phillips sounded louder but bass muddier . music vocal didn't separate clearly . ] again , i compared this sony mdr-xd200 . sony mdr-xd200 louder due its sensitivity but didn't give clear sound . only headphone i liked besides these koss ur21c but lacked loudness long cord . $7 above average sound quality , you never go wrong . oh yeah , it very comfortable . i wear these work long hours doesn't hurt even my glasses	1

i bought these speakers originally replacement pair weathered boston acoustics attached our overhead lattice back yard . these speakers very detailed i hear components music within tracks i would not expect able hear outdoors . said , bass extesion not great , but , given frequency range , i didn't expect it . i ended up reconditioning boston speakers also hooked these up . combination their bass extension ( must 40-50hz ) detailed polks extremely compelling , making outdoor listening surprisnigly good . even though one might pay more lower extension polks , it probably worth it if you like music . these good price , but limited . that not critisism , i knew this when i bought them ; i just hoping physics changed since last owner house bought bostons !	1

i've using this phone 2 years now ... fuming cheap nickel cadmium battery amount time well ! when i purchased it , this panasonic top-of-the-line phone . so naturally , i just assumed they used nickel hydride battery -like my last panasonic phone : kx-tg2550s . i didn't even notice battery right away . but when i finally got around opening up back handset , i * horrified * see nicd label ! since ' memory effect ' nickel cadmium batteries well known , using one something like cordless phone inexcusable ! this because it recharged frequently , usually never fully discharged -and unusable when it . [ ok , so you still use speakerphone base , gah ! might well just plug regular phone ! ] those haven't battery issues probably singing different tune after number months when nicd battery power output nosedives . since i've better battery performanace , there aint no going back ! there no other reason decision use such inferior technology , except save few bucks . or more likely , since panasonic replacement battery costs $20-25 , cash because they need replaced more often . [ absurd price because all battery consists -i took one apart- 3 aa size batteries ] fortunately , energizer now makes nickel hydride [ nimh ] replacement battery this phone , search amazon energizer er-p511	1

i bought tomtom go710 purely handsfree functionality ( which pretty bad ) ipod control . i viewed navigation part bonus . ipod control box pioneer bluetooth handsfree solution sony ericsson would cost me half not including installation . things looking good until i plugged ipod . it sounds like old turntable dusty record . i thought there something wrong so i contacted tomtom . they said it my windshield mount . they sent me new one . no help there . then they wanted it sent service . i . it took 5 weeks . no help there either . i am thinking it software fault operating system , or cpu unit just not up job . now second big let down . it doesn't charge ipod !!!!! so winter , if you forget bring your ipod car , it'll out juice very short time	-1

cd-rs much needed thing me . even if i still my music ipod , i still lot documents my computer . i definitely big enough hard drive store all my weird documents online-schooling such . but sometimes i go library or use different computer or so . i prefer using cd-rs rather than jumpdrive because they easy forget don't store very large amount -- which i believe it should price you paying those things . cd-rs less costly i don't need many , just few basically " just work " . these sony cd-rs just ! whenever i'm shopping cd-rs i look see what most inexpensive reliable brand . i most luck cd-rs sony , maxell , philips -- all three which decent manufacturers . tdk never seem burn speed they advertise . imation just seem coasters . memorex cd-rs paint always seem chip off just months after use . so i try searching those three brands . almost everytime sony always sale way below list price . i don't really need jewel cases either since i no desire keep my old documents -- least those date back months ago . jewel cases seem much more inexpensive when i don't buy them cd-rs . i suppose companies add them your cd-rs so you find them " value " . using sony cd-rs easy . i just like i any cd-r , burn my files through nero . i won't say these completely burn free , but even great maxell couple mess-ups every once awhile . but whether i'm burning music ( whatever reason since i now ipod ) or burning important documents , these cd-rs very trusty very little burn errors . maxell slightly more reliable than these , but price i can't see how you go wrong . these cd-rs also seem last fairly long me . i couple discs dating back early 2004 seeing some minor scratch top disc , but it certainly nothing unusable . some discs dating back then actually pretty good condition compared my tdk imaton discs . some reviewers complain data-loss after year or so after burning , but i yet notice this . all my cd-rs sony seem play fine any cd player i use my computer whatever age disc . bottom disc doesn't scratch easily other brands but collects fingerprints fairly well , which again why i like using jewel cases . also , cd-rs very clean-cut , meaning they lots room write . overall , these sony cd-rs work just fine me . they don't show many burn errors last good long time , plus sony name . they aren't quite good maxell cd-rs , but get job cheaper price . general , good " gets job without spending tons " cd-r . 4 stars	1

hdtv well packed worked just fine . picture fantastic over air hd stations , but not many true hd but merely digital low def ( most day ) . remote control very weak i rebuild it better performance . speakers put out such loud treble pops especially womens voices people cover their ears , so i reroute sound through headset jack my stereo . i could routed it differently through other rca jacks , but olevia their infinite wisdom made volume control not work such instance . i control ' headset ' volume remote however , though it dummied down nearly bass free sound . my last support letter olevia their abyssmal speakers received no reply . tv good value what it , but like any product , many shortcomings , tv stations even more it seems . they all abusing their hd bandwidth multiple copies 480i low def multicasting rarely use their bandwidth high definition . let hope us government demands they transmit least one hi def channel out their 5 or 6 broadcasting options . cable companies , beware , watch out missing dolby stereo jpg like image compression	1
great product , great price amazon ! i live malaysia , where local price 250% amazon list price . usd9$ ( shipment ) i it delivered singapore just few days , picked it up my friend place . first thing came out when i plugged it , my old monitor lived its useful life . althought colors still correct(able ) , overall luminosity so low i could only work dark room view full scale . i bought new lcd monitor , calibrated profiled it few minutes ( it wasn't quite right straight out box - too bright ) , now all my pictures come out beautifully ! i display 256 shades grey distinctively , which previously impossible . it not just photos , even dull windows interface suddenly comes life . highly recommended anyone dslr desire spend more than 5 minutes improving their pictures photoshop .	1

i've this lcd tv my house few weeks now i am very happy quality picture , size design . best way break this down into short review would list pros cons : pros : nice design ; wonderful picture hd signal dvds ; sturdy stand ; plenty inputscons : remote control terrible , shocks me panasonic would make such nice television then engineer remote just awful ; no pc inputbeing new new flat screen tvs i am little ignorant why/how analog signals fit this widescreen tv , but they picture doesn't seem stretched all . all all i am very happy this television don't miss my bulky cathode ray tube . this tv perfect bedroom , office or anywhere smaller tv used . only major downside atrocious remote control comes it , but that not enough take this down star . ***** highly recommende	1

i bought this keep up my college assignments work schedule . it isn't very useful because when you enter " " item day , it only show it you day . i either enter assignment every day which lot hassle or remember my 10 pg research paper due 12/5 ( isn't reason i bought it ? ) it could work people who tasks/appointments only require 1 day notice , but students who several long term projects , it waste money	-1
friend recently gave up his fathers old 78s which gems caruso spike jones . it quite find but who equipment play this stuff any more ?... who wants get up every 4 minutes turn it over ? well call me masochist but i decided give old treasures spin . i bought old thorens turntable ebay great sme tone arm . it plays all speeds including 16 rpm ... used sometimes braodcasters ... next thing i search cartridge . i surprised see good number available still made today . some quite expensive but i reasoned how much better could they justify price since old 78s rarely or never ! noise free . shure always made cartridges high quality good price range . so i chose m78s . it very compliant seems glide through grooves ease stability . it works very well my sme 3009 sii tonearm . results well worth modest cost cartridge . i would highly reccomend this cartridge anyone who wants give those oldies spin . you hear them better than ever !	1
this awesome scanner . compact , powerful , loaded features . easy use right out box . scans police frequencies , too ! crisp clear sound quality . this my 4th scanner i've ( i'm fire-medic)and it wonderful . but if you're so freaking inept you can't function without using computer find your front door or if you're so nieve you don't even know if your local pd scrambles their radio signals or if you think programming this unit more difficult than dialing cellphone or if you're so stuck yourself you can't miniature nascar logo your scanner ( which , way , every picture ever produce this unit ) , then this unit not one you ! ( i believe they still make play-doh . ) my guess your cousin your wife one same . but if you want quality product you'll happy you bought , this you . once you take it out box , just go [ ... ] click your state city you'll all frequencies you need . experiment different frequencies , well . enjoy	1
i love this mouse . small size makes it very easy pack into bag travel , also makes it easier me control . i've gone through many mice , this one my favorite so far . cord short , which good laptops , but would make it difficult use desktops	1

i looking small inexpensive pda ( windows pocket pc ) i would use reading books , playing few games , keep my contacts . there only few like available us . ipaq rx4200 just came out i decided give it try . my previous pda dell axim x3 . it smaller than most pdas , especially screen ( only 2.8 inches ) but it well build very comfortable hands . reading books rx4200 very comfortable ( i use haali reader - excellent free program reading books ) . screen bright - imho better quality then axim x3 - pda very comfortable hand , especially landscape mode . stylus good size , only issue it placed bottom left corner ( if you hold pda landscape mode ) it little difficult take out . overall i like it lot - due its size build quality . people who want play games it - there might issue - there no directional pad all this pda , so basically only games played it those stylus .	1

bought this device fell love it . screen great , audio excellent . it also bass boost which i think cool . only thing i found problem $40 extra software it need read mp4 . after putting my pictures it i noticed it kept freezing when i tried view them , but it because pictures too large . after changing size 1600x1200 it stopped gliching . far static i only notice it when i playback video i recorded , it so minute you won't really even notice it . i would probably change this 4 3/4 star	1
i picked up this guiatar because i interested playing electric well acoustic . first all guitar nice weight comes everything you need get started . if you don't know how tune guitar i suggest you buy electric tuner or search best method online tuning . guitar good sound it plays well right out box through amp . strings feel bit cheap , but if you get good cheap pair then would work well . overall money this good . especially if you buying it kid who wants it , but may out grow his desire play . guitars expensive long run good one set you back 500 - 1600 bucks . i'd get this see if you still interested it after set period time	1
so far no problems . western digital always one best hard disc manufacturers continues so . it working way it supposed . only reason i rate it 4 instead 5 ata drive always going better . otherwise , no complaints	1
while it appears i finally this switch mostly working , i say i'm very dissapointed it performance . iogear usb emulation keyboard mouse works very very poorly . keyboard mouse plugged into correct keyboard/mouse usb ports i would continually slow/stuck keyboard really poor mouse behaviour . i work around this plugging my keyboard/mouse into rear usb ports , thus bypassing keyboard emulation . this works although you wait all your usb devices re-enumerate every time you switch computers . while my mac powerbook works fine dvi switch , my pc quite often problems recognizing dvi monitor when switching back it . unplugging reconnecting lcd dvi connector into switch seems bring it back life . no idea where problem , but i dell 2001fp monitor , windows xp sp2 ati radeon 9800 ( everything running latest drivers/firmware ) . how iogear could shipped product this broken beyond me . unless they release firmware update fixes these problems i only recommend people stay well away this product	-1

nice solid construction . clever way folding up compactly so it same size my visor edge . i found two minor problems using it . until you get used it , attaching my pda keyboard tricky . this probably due way handspring designed connector not fault targus . other problem i most time when i connect keyboard my pda keyboard won't work unless i detach it , disable keyboard keyboard program , reattach keyboard , reattach keyboard , then reenable keyboard software . some experimentation i found if i just disable keyboard software before detaching keyboard , i didn't this problem . drawback remembering disable before detachment , enabling after attachment . aside these two minor problems , i still regard this excellent product	1

i bought different case first it wasn't what i wanted so instead i bought this one , contour design . i really like clear hard case large opening bottom where headphones go , i bought dlo one i open case recharge ipod which i find annoying . i also couldn't fit myh headphones because case too think , so this design works well me . i open close case number times before putting ipod still i can't get out ipod , i just stopped trying , im sure if i need ill able but design such it isn't really necessary . just sure you ready put it before you so . i think clip okay , it would nice if it could attached both ways , but im glad if it only one way they put it such you see screen . i like my case , i now slip nano my pocket not worry any scratches , etc	1

i only ever owned color ink jet printers such epson brother , but i must say , laser printing , hp takes cake . i own hp laserjet 4 plus ( monochrome b/w ) it worked great me 6 years plus . this new machine definitely major improvement . first off , it very easy set up you choose whether it run off usb port , or you network it through your system . i personally it connected my wireless d-link router i 2 windows pcs , 1 toshiba wireless laptop , 2 wireless macs networked all them able pick up hp provided hp software disk all able print it . it also prints so fast remarkably quiet . it monster machine size ( prepared nice big space it , both heighth , width length - it ( wxlxh ) 18.00 " 16.00 " 15.00 " but remember , you need room feed front it , you need room wires back ) . it takes 4 different cartridges ( cyan , magenta , yellow black - cmyk ) so this costly . cartridges run $80 each , so it costs $320 replace all them , however , they last whopping 2500 pages each color . it would take 5 ink cartridges each color last long . when toner low , you get warning . you even view printer network any connected computer see exactly how many pages left each cartridge ( based averages ) . bad : i'll try not leave bad comment this final thing say , however , it quite lousy paper feeder . i may doing something wrong , but i've found you only print one piece paper time . sometimes i print out lot stuff one-side paper , then , when i'm looking it , i turn paper over , place those manual feeder , then use paper again more printing other blank side . you can't really this . far printing business cards , or cardstock , it not best . you can't simply lay paper tray then printer print it . you insert paper special way , wait printer " suck " paper , then once it it , it able print . it print generic avery labels okay though . all all , it great . oh , there one astounding point i forgot make : it prints both sides without change paper around or anything , called duplexing ( sorry , i didn't know these terms before ) . example , i 14-page document print out , so i just went ' finishing ' tab selected ' print both sides ' wahlah , it printed 7 pieces paper , two-sided absolutely flawlessly , without touch or insert anything . i eventually printed 200 double-sided brochures shiny color magazine type paper , printing perfect . if you don't need this printer network , you don't need duplex ( double-sided ) printing , get much cheaper hp 1600 color laser . otherwise , color laser printer under $500 able networked duplex among other things , it really great deal all around , thus , it gets 4 stars . i deduct one star bad paper feeder , but aside , it superb . get yours now - cartridges already it full-sized ( not sample cartridges ) , so it ready go . you may need network cable , but it come usb 2.0 cable just case you don't one . enjoy thank you reading	1
i purchased this radio primarily shortwave use week ago radioshack $50 , it my first . other reviews consistent its performance am/fm bands - strong impressive . shortwave reception also good , but there limitations which may or may not reflect radio itself . it important read introduction shortwave featured instruction booklet , so you know where start . here some other lessons learned . i just returned business trip outside boston , where i unable tune any shortwave signals my hotel room second floor near window . i listening night tried all 7 bands . home , i only able tune two stations sw1 , also during night time period . this disappointing . however , last night i hit paydirt . i took radio bedroom , second floor our house , found many stations several bands . addition number us stations , i heard stations western europe , cuba , what i think korean station , also what sounded like russian or some eastern european language . since our neighborhood consists closely spaced houses , i guess i should not surprised poor first-floor performance . not sure what problem near boston . i like volume dial one side radio , tuning dial other . way , you scan different frequencies , you adjust volume background noise increases or fades . one thing i noticed digital display displays 0.5 incremental changes frequency , but i think it tunes more finely than this . i might hit . 5 mark , tune ever so slightly , hear something different even though digital readout not change . since it analog tuner , i suppose this makes sense . unfortunately , i already grown impatient radio before first positive experience described above . haste , i decided get different radio instead , just ordered kaito ka1103 . those considering several models , i digress share results search portable sw radio good sensitivity until $150 ( street prices ) . reviews radios found eham.net under " reviews " " receivers general " there select reviews other sites such radiointel.com . top contenders $80-$150 category ( street prices ) sony 7600 , sangean ats909 , grundig yb400 , kaito ka1103 . grundig s350 also popular , but i saw one radioshack it quite large . i read every review i could find , narrowed choices kaito sony based performance considerations . then i phoned universal-radio.com after talking sales person , settled kaito $90 ( they sell both finalist models ) . sony may slight edge holding signal , reportedly built like tank , but kaito significantly cheaper (...) . addition , kaito comes charger , rechargeable batteries , external antenna . sony features none these . univeral radio told me charge sony offer extra money junk , they sold there own custom built units . radio made shortlist kaito ka1101 . several reviewers commented they really liked model . (...) i also learned recently there book called passport world band radio considered indispensible learning what sw stations out there where when find them broadcasting . they also lots radio reviews . (...) . here some links you might want check out : reviews http://www.eham.net/reviews/products/8http://www.radiointel.com/reviews.htm (...) if you strapped cash , also consider grundig fr200 fr300 (...) . both offer am/fm . fr200 offers sw1 sw2 fr300 offers weather bands . tuners analog function well . these considered ' emergency radios ' such offer other things . addition radio functions , they charged using attached hand crank ( or run aa batteries ) . hand crank charge cells phones ( multiple adaptors included ) . fr200 white led flash light , red led flasher , siren , also weather alert . latter interesting . you radio silent , but set ' alert ' setting . if weather alert sent national weather service , radio beep . kind cool . however , we found they issue these alerts 1-2 times week , response what many people would not consider real emergency ( wind gusts up 25 mph emergency ? ) so , i turn off alert function unless i know there possibility serious weather conditions	1

i just received this tv today simply amazed . my opinion there four things make this excellent buy : 1 . easy setup . tv comes factory mounted stand . cable hook ups well located easy get . 2 . auto language channel set up . when you first turn tv , it prompts you your choice language . then it automatically selects all your cable channels . 3 . remote very high quality , not like other manufacterers who supply cheap remotes their sets . 4 . picture quality . right out box , picture amazing . bright colors , excellent blacks , very sharp picture ( this without using hd ) . almost unlimited viewing angles too ! i seen or bought several lcd tv , without question , this best bunch . i would definitely recommend this tv	1

i've my pepper pad 3 three weeks now am loving it ... i use it every morning read paper , fact i've cancelled my daily paper subscriptions because i prefer read news my pad ( change nearly covers cost pad ) . scroll wheel makes it super easy read even extended articles , i follow up any article . kitchen , it become my main recipe book . web hand 3 seconds , i'm never short ideas advice . splash-resistant design seems work well . i've not so careful keep it out harms way still . even after i've spilled water it , dropped it counter , bumped what not , pad still works great . my favorite use pad so far , though , play go ( game somewhat similar chess ) . i lay down couch tap screen play against players around world . it far best device playing on-line board games i've found . yes , there some bugs , but i've found software recovers gracefully what i'm doing , it not caused any real problems . i wouldn't use pad my work pc , but then again , i wouldn't use my work pc kitchen counter top . i'd highly recommend pepper pad 3 ( plus home wifi network ) anyone who wants web everywhere without computers all over house	1

all who interested mz-rh1 , i recently this item purchased japan silver . black model same , some ways better only due manual english . machine itself , there clear definition per sony maturity its years since inception minidisc . after purchasing 10th anniversary n10 model , then it stolen , i hesitant purchasing model fear there update better . mz-rh1 , i no fear this model define sound reputation minidisc rest its years . it clearly lit oled screen side player simply brilliant , conserving battery life while displaying necessary functions player . one downside lack group button . those familiar minidisc know sonicstage stores your music groups , pressing group button skip groups so you find album you looking . this missing player itself , but it handily found remote those who choose use it . those us who really take our sound quality seriously , this player/recorder most clear balanced sound i ever heard any minidisc , quite arguably any recorder . sony not hesitant create this model portable recording studio . i am impressed sound , which rivals compact disc quality , it levels line out never distort . not mention new version sonic stage much more user-friendly than before , compability apple's; finally ! i now record my brother dj mixes into my mz-rh1 , then copy into sonic stage , burn cd ( files recorded hi-md discs saved sonic stage wav . files ) , then share friends . it quite simply portable recording studio . thank you sony creating music recorder finally satisfy your demanding customers .	1

i thought lack querty keyboard would slow me down . it didn't . this excellent labeler only $20 . i figured out how make labels different fonts , boxes , 2 lines , etc ., 5 minutes , without reading manual . only small wish i might ask higher resolution print like brother labeler . my wife uses one . however , labels split backing really makes this labeler superior me . brother doesn't split backing i've spent two or three minutes per label trying peel back off brother labels . my son likes dymo alligator box outline . i like big fonts option . i'm off label some stuff probably doesn't need label , but i new toy	1
it work only until one year which there warranty after it all depends your luck . mine stopped working 14th month , took it local repair shop , low quality unavailable parts , so repair not possible except syntax . they ask arm leg fix it top shipping this heavy junk , you better off buying well known brand extended warranty	-1
this television hasn't worked right since i got it , support not so great . i simply cannot get it display full screen . comcast doesn't carry id# which makes setup complete guesswork . i really might well bought good 32 inch set . well , i get advantage taller screen 4:3 aspect , which nice . picture quality fine . i seen reviews clunky remote , but i don't any problems how it looks or feels . you aim it pretty close bottom set . right now i wish i spent $600	-1
this thing plays everything . it plays various formats mp3 , wma , wav , just name few . comes car kit so you play it through your car stereo tape player . doesn't sound right adapter came it though . ( sounds muffled through right speakers but good left speakers ) . if you record songs your computer use highest bitrate possible , it sound more clear when listening headphones . it comes other accessories like adapter plug cigarette lighter jack , ear-bud earphones , hardwire remote plugs into cd walkman play , pause , stop , rewind , fast forward through song tracks when using car adapter your car	1
i concerned keeping my new toy safe elements . this product fits performs perfectly . i am impressed fact it thin you really cant see it your mac book . i also like fact i put stickers other stuff my new laptop . reason i bought this product because i wanted some more structure my screen . i laptops before one screen break opening it up . i thought this product would give lcd more stiffness so far nothing broke . this product worth investment	1
this not range it states it . i even called their customer service person asked this agreed me . maybe useful people city near tower , other wise it pretty useless	-1
instructions vague hard understand because this machine china . after using machine few months , i got hang it use it little differently than instructions suggest . i get fantastic results using white pads 90% time . yellow pads only used if discs completely thrashed . liquid polish best stuff use . i also use creams white pads if disc very scratchy . i sell dvd/cd living this machine greatly improved my sales prices . must all sellers dvd/cd/games . it pay itself !	1

this really great product . it great features i am very happy it	1
just recently purchased this amazon , few hiccups shipping but these things happen , since price online great shipping free it doesn't hurt bad overlook mishap . it hard begin praise quality sound picture your going get amount money you pay this htib ( home theater box ) system . i am far no expert but i worked car audio industry 5 years now few friends expensive surround systems so i know difference quality sound , decent sound bad sound . there noticable difference quality this high end stuff which expected , but price your paying this sony system can't beat . set up breeze connecting everything very easy . sound crisp clear . i got my 42 lcd tv few weeks before this while i watching movies off xbox360 . picture great but sound really didn't add up . this system provided sound level quality equal picture . there few times when i jumped up while loungin couch cause sound so real . also if your gamer pick up optical cable 360 run it through this system it broadcast games 5.1 digital which change your life . if your gamer digital cable , you'll need pick up digital coaxial cable well otherwise you'll switch optical 360 cable if you want watch cable 5.1 picture wise dvds look great , i tell noticable difference quality upscaling vs watching dvd reg . player . bear mind it not going look like hd dvd or blu ray movie but its pretty close should satisfy most people . now addressing some critics out there . it load really slow it hard keeping track discs . my point why would you 5 dvds loaded first place you only watch one movie time , unless your marathoning sopranos or sergio leone movie night there no need . i've keeping slots one two open dvd leaving other 3 music which seems divide things up makes it more easy keep track things . sub way loud . i'm amazed sony didn't put control knob sub box , my previous cheaper phillips system well my computer speakers . this reason why its not five star system . contrary other claims you adjust sub . you go setup menu customize setup ( this after you auto cal . ) sound quality music isn't greatest , cds sound pretty good but if you hook laptop up digital music volume pretty low . when its all said , quality you get this system well beyond price tag . it few kinks doesn't sound like ultra high end system , but you really don't need something like your house unless you huge home theater room anyway . styling this system retro pretty cool speakers look great , picture sound awesome	1
i use it computer monitor , playing xbox , watching digital cable . it well worth its price highly recommend it anyone . excellent picture quality . only one problem ; one four holes used mounting tv wall stripped out very easily . makes you weary just thinking putting it up . if you , buy original manufacturer mount instead aftermarket .	1
very effective , soothing helpful back ache sciatica . great value	1
this dock waste me . it came home av pack . i wanted durable zune case would look good protect screen same time . toughskin case all three exactly what i looking protection . only down side toughskin case zune not fit this docking station while it case . i believe engineering problem docking station . this not bulky case , it fits zune perfectly , however , even removing insert docking station , zune not fit dock while case . why they didn't make docking station would accommodate zune fitted case , makes no sense . no one going want take trouble removing case each time they dock their zune . they should take these docking stations back customers who feel i replace them their expense something works ! toughskin case , i highly recommend it ; other cases just didn't seem offer this quality protection while also nice professional appearance .	-1
i read many reviews many customers variety headphones . i leary hi low-end products . i sought mid-range . its kinda unknown territory this on-line purchasing unseen , untested merchandise . i read some pretty good reviews this v-moda line . when product finally arrived i listened , well say i amazed would understatement . i love sound these earbuds produce . they amazing . i am very pleased sound quality highs especially bass - wow !. audio cable little thin , so careful them . earbuds stay my ear very well . i use adapters earbuds out box . noise cancelling feature outstanding . i work industrial environment very loud machines i think these work better than my ear plugs . music makes work more tolerable . i would highly recommend this product anyone everyone . enjoy them i . thanks reading my review	1

neoprene holder won't snap into clip any angle , like my cell phone holder . i thought it defective until i fiddled around it , rotating holder 90 degrees found out it snap . there rivet nearby maybe rivet preventing holder snapping upright position . otherwise , it fits my receiver well clear front cover makes it nice operate gps without open up or remove unit holder , like some i've seen	1
microphone works great . sound produced noticeable difference compared internal mic ( course ) . it makes video sound so much more professional . ps : visualdude- sounds like you didn't research what you buying . all interference incorrect specifications .	1
works feels just like laptop keyboard touchpad mouse . while touchpad little imprecise and/or touchy , it no more so than what you would find laptop . i use it conjunction my home theater pc which displays big screen tv , it works great set up . i give it only four stars due its high cost given its lack advanced features or technology . i mention i somewhat concerned confused when i received product box stated " mini keyboard " . you read elsewhere , there " mini " model many people trouble . after contacting amazon what i thought shipping mistake ( receiving identical item when quickly re-shipped ) i determined comparing model numbers dimensions adesso site i received correct model spite confusing " mini " designation box . all all , quite satisfied product amazon customer service , what essentially non-issue .	1
gaming , steelsound 5h usb v2 best i used date . they comfortable , cover entire ear ( but don't give you headache like other full-ear headsets ) , sound great ... after adjusting equalizer bit . straight out box , games sounded extremely " tinny " , microphone had/has very annoying high pitched noise sounds like electronic interference . after checking friends who also use this headset , after bypassing usb dongle , you see microphones poor quality comes usb attachment . after teammates ventrilo complain annoying feedback noise , i spent hour adjusting microphones volume usb soundcard drivers , ventrilo . those you also this problem , raise your microphones volume soundcard control , lower your volume ventrilo / teamspeak / whatever you use . even after tweaking it , there still buzz , but i'm told it isn't annoying . if it weren't , this headset would get 5 stars , but poor quality microphone input usb device drags it down bit . aside , amazing sound after you go mess equalizer . music , games , sound great	1

recent review i read pc magazine where they felt atracformat noisy , not case . disk i started ( using atrac ) sounds roughly good some disks i dubbed using md deck some time earlier . hence my decision go this technology opposed flash ram or hard drive based devices since i already md library . it sounds pretty good , not great it portable device my ears pretty good such things . i hope it lasts while because looks like sony getting ready bail md format i don't want return make any more sony electronics ( non-media ) purchases . don't get me started rootkit nonsense because i believe music execs all deserve jail creating new conduit spyware	1
after purchasing several other cordless phones not able hear clearly any them i finally hit winner this one . sound quality superb . my only complaints 1 ) both extensions cannot used same time ( security feature ? ) , 2 ) no hold or mute buttons . given sound quality far most important virtue i place telephone i would purchase this telephone again or without hold/mute buttons . later note : thanks reviewer i now know phone permit two-handsets used same time , muting , putting call hold . although none these functions intuitive , they available . thanks very much setting me straight	1

well , not much more i say new eton e1 ( hasn't already said my radio club friend ray ) other than i am grundig ( germany ) satellit " nut " i waiting satellit 900 come out ( 10 ) years nutshell .... it finally here !!! max grundig would proud !!! this great radio . i'm not " into " xm ... i like shortwave radio eton e1 * delivers " when it comes sw !!! ( am , fm xm aren't too bad either !!! ) best " lap size " portable sw radio introduced ( me ) since grundig satellit 700 . worth every penny ( 10 ) year wait !!!	1
i bought this scanner when my old faithful mustek gave up ghost . i like this one because it sleek turned it side if space problem . i also like it button functions , since it makes it very easy someone like my mother , who just basic computer user , scan . sometimes she make copy something instead getting her car going staples pay nickel copy , she now put it scanner glass push " copy " button . not speediest way make copy , but still faster than driving copy center . anyway , one reasons i bought this particular scanner negative/slide scanning . i pretty disappointed , like previous reviewer , find it not easily slide copies , yet functionality so . ( you scan positive transparancies ) . attachment filmstrips bulky , but easily attached , it wants you actual 35mm film strip . this problem if you only partial strips or non-35mm strips . however , i am happy say little manipulation , you actually all above plus slides . however , doing slides means you probably never again show them projector . you must remove slide it mat place it glass inside filmstrip attachment then scan positive . same goes partial strips non-35mm . scanning software actually each frame individually , so it doesnt matter if you only one shot or strip 6 . if you not intending sit down your whole slide or negative collection one sitting , you fine this . however , if your main intent slides easiest possible way , you should investigate other scanners	1
who doesn't love music their shower ? i originally purchased much pricier player sharper image , which stopped playing within first month . luckily , still under warranty , i got replacement . this one stopped after four months ... no longer under 90 day warranty . so then i research this one one . i love it . it much more compact than tsi model , significantly sturdier , hangs anywhere your shower well free stands unobtrusively anywhere else , less expensive , easy use program , latching door you know keeps water out . just all around nicely designed , user friendly cd player	1
i just got my player today , i haven't able put it down . it fairly easy install , well . you need get rechargable aaa batteries , this eats batteries up pretty quick . that really only gripe i player ; other than , it so much better than my previous mp3 player . if you're looking decent mp3 player , i highly recommend this product . it definitely worth money .	1

this worst purchase any type computer hardware i ever made . it felt very light flimsy , definition cheap plastic . not just construction but performance terrible . it would work perfectly half hour then go break nothing 10 minutes . this very very frustrating . maybe i just unlucky received defective one , but i wouldn't take chance again . i wish i could give this device worse rating , somewhere around -4 would much more appropriate .	-1
luckily , i didn't pay penny motorized skipdr . it given us " prize .

player stopped working after only few months - it would accept dvds but not play them refuse eject them . behavior started out intermittent , but it finally gave up ghost swallowed dvd never let go . we take player apart just get dvd out before throwing player away trash . our previous dvd player lasted over 5 years before it started skipping . this one lasted less than year before it stopped working altogether - what waste . save your time money buy machine	-1

ok .... i bought one these refurb thinking it great bargain ... hey 5gb less than $100 what deal . once you get hang loading working windows media player its not big deal load . unfortunately after it begins locking up not recognizing songs ( which requires drive reformat reinstallation songs ) you get really good it . it 4 months before it stopped even recognizing hd no longer worked all . i thought maybe reason i bought refurb so new one better ... right ? so i stupidly bought brand new one .. again less than $100 . this one now begun lock up reload problem within 2 months reciept i just recently got " not recognizing hd " message . i am hopes getting it work but right now its just expensive paperweight . i am 0/2 these players so i don't believe they worth shipping it takes send them back . beware this product	-1

i purchased this because i lot math online hoping i could use this purpose . also i hoping able use it taking notes . so far , i'm not impressed . pen crummy little plastic thing not very satisfying use . it actually very uncomfortable -- particularly when you consider you press very hard get your entire note set recorded . talk writer cramp!i'm also disappointed you can't write it it instantly displayed computer interactively . my fault not understanding functionality better but i thought this could double writing tablet . i can't speak size paper since i haven't tried any other size . general , big disappointment 90 dollars i would better off just setting fire ! item destined craigslis t.p.s. -- reviewer who wanting handwriting recognition -- my pad come trial version package would convert text . course , very limited use since stooopid thing failed capture my handwriting accurately first place . but capability there ..	-1
product shipped me moscow . after first charge , i took it university where it powered my notebook two hours . upon returning home recharging device , i discover it not turn anymore . i suspect battery charging led indicates this it connected ac power . however , disconnecting it any power source , it appears ac outlet usb ports no longer function . device gives no auditory signal or led message , so i don't know if built inverter out or something else wrong it . either way , i'm left dead device never supported charging 45 watt solar panel anyway . i strongly suggest getting battery tekkeon . sorry bad review , but i my hopes this device well .	-1

this terrible . i returned after hours tech support days email exchanges apple support desk . product probably better future software updates , but my experience , it fairly unreliable its current state . examples problems : wouldn't download drm managed content online , problems when downloading itunes purchased music ( first time i've problem 4 years ipods itunes ) , couldn't connect my corporate vpn , finally , just evidence lack qa this device , included instruction manuals previous version apple extreme . images previous white , button-shaped device . this genuine disappointment , it seemed stem bad software bad qa . others seem more success , but i'm back my 802.11 airport extreme all problems magically disappeared	-1
i cannot speak all devices , but this total failure my case . i am fast typist , it seemed 20% keystrokes not picked up my treo 270 . this simply unacceptable , so i immediately returned it . i cannot determine whether problem due keyboard , software , or my old pda . newer , faster pdas might better success rate , but potential problems still there . my suggestion buy this somewhere generous return policy so you return it if it mismatch your pda	-1
when i first got this camera , i satisfied . it complicated use ( definitely not intuitive ) because it so much so few buttons you need scroll through endless screens time sto what you want . however , it took pretty good pictures . however , soon after warranty expired , it began overexpose pictures we couldn't stop it doing . we tried contact fuji but gotten no response . my wife found this common problem ( overeposure lack response fuji ) , which probably why they lot refurbished ones sell . hopefully , they fixed problem but i wouldn't bet my money it . this camera given us more frustration than it worth	-1

usually i discount negative reviews . i think people may sour grapes against company , or not understand how install or work something . i somewhat tech savvy - i installed our wireless network took little doing . i work technical recruiter , so technology doesn't intimidate me . i like technology . so i nudging my husband print server so i could print without going printer plugging . he came home this belkin product went installing it . usually i like research before i purchase product , but he wanted handle this . so , he installed it , i went back checked his work , he followed instructions exactly . i know he some trouble , called tech support my suggestion - i would never gotten wireless router hooked up without tech support . only problem , printserver doesn't work . so , i tried installing software my pc , trying problem solve there . i called tech support hotline back , got operator who promised technician call me back short period time . i waited 2 hours , then went out run some errands . there still no message technician when i returned . this morning my husband needed get some work home . he created document , knowing print server not work , he wired up printer print way . but now , printer won't respond signal , so he can't print way either . so we deleted belkin software rebooted computer . he still can't print . so , i went back my pc , tried delete software through control panel . it won't delete . i am getting error message . i can't print either . so now i am hold belkin customer assistance . maybe it coincidence but good english person who refers himself operator , i swear i hear little indian accent . doesn't mean customer support outsourced india , even if it , doesn't mean customer support bad . but my experience this while i get real live person phone , he can't thing help me except promise me someone call back . when i tried get my problem escalated , i overwhelmed him he put me hold . i am still hold . i hold 35 minutes no help sight . i called back my cell phone , someone who sounded so much like first operator i spoke said he would escalate my call level 2 technician , someone would call back 1-2 hours . when i strongly protested , asked his name , asked number i could call directly , he offered transfer me immediately , now , i hold additional 10 minutes my cell phone . i am starting sense trend here . my husband - boiling over his inability print important document , gone off work print it there . i am sitting my sofa phones going stereo , waiting see if anyone cyberspace going pick up my call . i usually discount negative reviews , but this really my experience this product , if you considering purchasing it , i would encourage you think through little further .	-1

( or medium wave ) dx'ing shortwave listening . it performance a.m. par highly regarded kaito ka-1103 which i received christmas this year . shortwave performance very close , however , kaito superior this area ( features ssb tuning well) f.m. ? e-10 well above average but falls short kaito ka-1103 . i've yet see radio equal kaitos performance this area , but e-10 closer than most . build quality , ergonomics , appearance second none better than most . slightly rubberized texture this set just plain feels good when handling adds overall impression this " top line " portable multi band receiver even though it moderately priced . it lcd digital display one largest nicest i've seen , very easy see well lit pleasant orange backlight . other amenities such 500 plus memories , 12/24 hour clock , i.f. shift antennae trim which both useful shortwave reception , local/dx switch internal battery charger nicad or nimh batteries all add up make this radio i'm glad i purchased often recommend those needing radio this type . even accessories included this radio such carrying satchel , earbuds , reel-up shortwave antennae top notch ! now , if you're wondering why , after all this praise i only gave it four star rating , not five it because eton not provide ssb tuning capability this receiver . it shame because it shortwave performance good enough utilize it . my opinion they shortchanged this otherwise exceptional radio . hence they only " hit triple " (which way more exciting nonetheless , i'm baseball nut too ) not home run	1
he estado disfrutando de este tv por alredeor de 5 dias , la imagen es muy buena , facil de instalar , lo unico que se deberia mejorar es el sonido .	1

i use print works cd/dvd envelopes worried when i ordered this product envelopes wouldn't fit top-up which important me because i label tops my envelops make looking through them easier . envelopes just hair over 5 " wide they fit into these storage boxes perfectly . there just enough room either side make flipping through dvds easy . i ordered four these am glad i . i keep them shelf side-by-seide make perfect card-catalog-type filing systemfor all my dvds . i most definately ordering up more these when i need more room ; these boxes great . if you use 5 " wide envelope , rest assured these boxes just right size fit all your dvds .	1

i just bought my first laptop computer really , really hated touchpad . i found it unresponsive times found whole right clicking using pad same time pain . i spent while browsing different mice available this other sites end decided upon this little number . i am very happy i too . its pretty small very lightweight but same time it doesnt feel all fragile - definately well made . im 5'11 fairly big hands - i find this mouse comfortable use . it looks pretty cool too , red panels side light up , which always good night work . all buttons very responsive middle button godsend after using touchpad past month . i couldnt ask better all round performance . $20 you really cant go wrong , it really great price microsoft mouse . only reason i dont give it five stars ?? well this technology - although it awesome piece kit , there always other things or features they could added	1

this cable really cleaned up display image . i running monster cable - 6 meter version . i needed length before because way my system configured . i review under cable how quality matter . so length . time i wrote review i just ordering cable posting what i found out researching digital video signals . everything there stands true . i changed my setup decided invest shorter version cable - 1 meter version - because i could now get away much shorter cable . i installed it this morning difference , while not earth shattering , definitely visible . i use this cable connect video card media pc my tv ( sony rear-projection lcd ) . image used swim little edges some windows , text , etc ., image wasn't clear i hoped . while image looked good , it didn't look great . that why i decided take plunge spend extra $79 bucks . difference somethine like going regular rf feed your tv component video cables . now image crisp clear there no swimming . it actually brings out detail i couldn't even see before - point deciding turn fsaa filtering so video games more realistic look . they . i don't know how other brands compare monster cables i haven't tried them . what i know signal integrity very important good looking display . you get high quality cables keeping length absolute minimum required there very perceptible difference just 1 meter 6 meter versions exact same thing . one more thing while i'm here . i want thank amazon going extra mile customer service . i dvd disappear somehow during shipping . ups said they delivered it but i never received it . i asked amazon if they filed report ups or i file claim . what i got reply telling me replacement already its way . service . thanks amazon	1
mine over half year now , after outstanding abuse it performs well day i bought it . i fill it empty it every month , rarely ever defragging it , back up my pc files play movies right off it my laptop . throw it my backpack , plug unplug it all day(hotswaping ) , still rarely sign slowdown , it barely gets cool warm ever(even when its running inside my backpack ) . some reason requires two usb ports my new pc ( high speed usb 2.0 ports ) when it shouldn't . it runs one port school just fine i switched cable regular usb cable 50% success . i'd buy one these heartbeat if i ever thought one i would run itself out . fact it doesn't need external ac adapter run my usb 1.1 laptop ports(though it hole non-included ac adapter)is blessing . i've even used its double usb cord run my power hog external cd-rom drive(my cd-rom ac doesnt work both sadly ) . might luck draw , hd related items seem sometimes , i've yet try out their customer service . but overall worth every cent spent(especially since i looking 4gb external $40 before i saw this ) . nearly $1 gig great deal .	1

i would give high recommendation this tv . it perfect size bedroom especially if you're not looking overwhelm room but you just want something watch late night movie , morning or evening news , or late shows high def . dvd player works great really completes package it seems not increase size tv all . picture outstanding isn't what really matters end ??!! only little annoying thing concerns what would great feature but big limitation - tv aut o-o feature so you use it like alarm clock but it requires you select channel which tune tv once it goes . it you use hdmi i am get signal your cable box , you must tv input mode set hdmi but you can't set aut o-o hdmi input ( it must channel number ) . engineers just didn't think one through all way . oh well , still great tv	1

i'm afraid i agree other previously happy memorex users noting memorex quality/success rate gone downhill . i skeptical when i read other reviews i stuck memorex , but i seen light now . year i very successful dvd+r memorex disks . 25 pack spindles i would buy , they would all work .... so aug ' 04 i bought 2 25 packs circuit city ( mistake ? ) . appears waste money . i just tried burn copy something i ended up trashing 4 disks row . i convincing myself it my hardware or program or something else . then i remembered someone given me blank sony dvd-r disk , so i thought what heck , let me try one . into sony drive it went it copied without hitch . final straw my memorex loyalty . out pack 25 , i 10 left , but trash 6 15 i used . not good success ratio . bye memorex	-1

i shopping pair headphones ability block out background noise sometime now since i work loud environment . i really shy buying this pair or any matter because some reviews weren't favorable . i nervous . however , i bought these because name altec lansing audio . i shocked when i first listened them . i replace rubber tips use foam ones because rubber ones just not comfortable . but wow ! clarity these phones incredible . no matter what others said these , i found bass tight , but not booming . if someone wants booming bass like what would heard nightclubs , then they need stay away headphones period . if you searching pair iems , then if i you , i would seriously consider this pair . just make sure seal tight they all way , which i never really found issue . i don't really understand what others doing wrong . if you bought these , i highly recommend it , you would not sorry . i am thouroughly impressed mine	1

i purchased this product after quite bit research after finding it finally available windows i couldn't wait get my hands one . why wouldn't i ? it supposed best thing since sliced bread . first it looked like really cool product , , if your system mac . logitech great job selling nulooq windows system users but only give you half software operate it . there no tooldial windows version ( fact they don't disclose ) which probably most powerful feature this product . i now feel though i wasted my money what useless tool ( if you windows ) totally conned logitech . what even worse fact logitech don't any future plans include tooldial driver window users . so if all you want able zoom scroll then this product you .... i know where there one sale !!!	-1

this everything i looked mp3 player , but only first 6 months . half year getting it headphone input went , making audio staticy constantly going mono . send it repairs . after 5-6 months light use ( mostly car , so it not like it bumped around bags pockets ) problem reoccurred . send it repairs again . couple months later , after 1 year warranty expired , i noticed battery life started decrease . few weeks it got point lasting only hour after fully charged . i nevertheless continued using unit , extra careful damn headphone jack making sure i charge it every night . so couple weeks ago ( 15 months after purchase ) it stopped working completely . when turned it gives " hdd error " message . resetting not work . computer no longer " sees " it when it plugged . i emailed tech support got they said it looks like hard drive needs replaced possible cost $195 . needless say i won't investing two hundred bucks into clearly faulty unit . i really liked it before problems started eventually planning upgrade 60gb model , but i doubt i'll trust this manufacturer again	-1
i bought this tv march this year ( 2006 ) it worked perfectly until sony techs came out " updated " my firmware . i not any problems tv but thought it should updated or possibly affect warranty . soon tech left i turned tv , fan running " high " loud . this not happen until software updated . i went into functions tried use high alt function turn fan low ( off ) but would work . good news i bought extended warranty get it fixed , or replaced ......... word caution , you may consider not updating firmware if tv working , buy extended warranty . i paid $300 4 years figure i'll get least one $250 bulb out deal ( yes , it covered ) . otherwise , tv perfect	1
i purchased sony dav-fx100w system over internet . it surprisingly arrived only few days . assembly wiring instructions well . it looks good matches well my sony hdtv . sound quality just fine movies tv programs but fair best listening music cd or fm tuner compares inexpensive stereo . base not tight kind whoompy , although there plenty it . i actually decrease it 3 db . many sound stages remarkably different true sense there such " sport " which sound like stadium . most time it best " auto " performing method audio recorded . ir transmitter/receiver works well but there still plenty wires rear speakers such ac power amp , wire ir receive amp , wires amp both rear speakers . not clean one might imagine product description . mentioned previous reviews , 5 disk changer very slow rather tricky insert disk until you get knack . 5 disk change not necessary system would probably used dvd watching movies opposed inserting multiple cd listen music . i certainly would prefer my stereo ! over all i am satisfied it recommend it . it performs well what it intended , reproduce sound movies tv . again it good looking system .	1
while i am pleased quality sound this system gives me , i am little disappointed . i've this thing couple years now , 9 months it stopped giving me sound . so i went back replaced it . they didn't even ask what problem , they gave no arguement because they so many returns replacements . then over past few months dvd player making pretty loud noise whenever i use it , i turn volume up pretty high just not hear it . now player stopped working completely . i dvd there i can't get out ( which record part sopranos season , they dont sell discs seperatly their seasons expensive which pretty annoying replace ) . bose failed me once , shame them . they failed me twice , shame me . i'm gonna go something else	-1
2.0 gb sandisk cruzer micro flash drive looked like good deal when i saw it display office depot . it roomy enough all my data configuration files , rated usb 2.0 , reasonably priced . my first choice would larger version 1.0 gb iomega i use work , but , alas , such wasn't available . unfortunately , i waited too long put sandisk through its paces , or i would tried get refund . many others remarked , it horribly slow . while backing up my roughly 10,000 files , i found it taking second per file -- longer big ones . this translated around four hours complete whole operation . bulk deletes take just long carry out . using my beyond compare file synchronization software * read * sandisk compare its contents what my hard drive went reasonably fast -- until , no obvious reason , it hung one particular word document this evening . i couldn't even get my windows xp machine shut down without yanking sandisk its slot : usual " safely remove hardware " operation wouldn't work . after three attempts read same file , three reboots , i tried delete it windows explorer -- this operation hung too . finally i able deletion dos prompt . just like 1985 ! i then recopied file , now beyond compare finish its work without hitch . but i trust sandisk deliver up my precious files when i really need them ? i dunno .... so , it back drawing board . maybe now iomega come out 2.0 gb model . sandisk , i'm reminded painful adage : you get what you pay . ugh	-1

i trying find way easily carry lot camera equipment quite some time . i tried backpacks , shoulder bags , duffel bags , but none them really worked all well . then i saw lowepro street field system completely customizable pouches , vests , belts , accessories . it works great , you only get pouches you need so there no waisted space you organize them however you want according how often they used ( put frequently used items easier access places . ) variety alone this system worth investment , but quality ease use also very high which big plus . you get case any lens , camera body , or accessory you . i even cases my cell phone water bottle . one word caution , sure measure your lens lens hood backwards if you use them make sure entire thing fit into pouch , because sometimes lens fit , but then lens lens hood not . i often carry 5-6 lenses , extension tubes , teleconverters , extra memory cards batteries , bunch cleaning supplies other gadgets , which weights ton . but when they evenly distributed this vest/belt lowepro system it actually very manageable . only down side everyone staring you because you thousands dollars camera equipment strapped your body . but if you overlook , this way go . i used this system many zoos without ever problems , fact just unzipping single lens switching seems safer me than opening entire bag equipment every time you want switch lenses . many cases also come built rain/snow cover so if weather changes all your equipment not destroyed . you also put just few pouches normal belt when you just going take photos back yard or don't need take all your equipment , which nice . i really can't say enough how much easier this makes traveling lot equipment , if you hopelessly searching better solution , consider this , you won't regret it .	1

best ever , i tell ... my choice 9x12 format decision taken based my traditional arts background , since i make oil paintings traditional lineart drawing concept arts , i use very much wide strokes combination " wrist arm wide motion " . so this tablet well suited this task not too much exagerated size not too small wide movements . 6x8 wacom tablet would more restricted me , but those who like small area usage drawing painting this 9x12 digital adjust so you work it 6x8 , but remember space your desk , it not ' mouse pad ' definitively , get 19 " monitor screen - flat it down table , that almost same space you gonna need . way ... those thinking something different wacom tablets ... don't think ! wacom only one you trust 100% , no doubts , i've tried many ... if you don't know wich wacom suits best you , i suggest you go www.wacom.com , they questionaire there help you out , but it simple : if you pro ... get this intuos3 or better intuos available , that hardcore professional choice , if don't need much pressure sensitivity , make ' lighter ' work , go graphire , if you pro want something work milimetrical accuracy like architecture or technical design get cintiq ( this one top expesive one ) . other application work perfect it too , like 3d software , i use xsi , max , maya , zbrush(this one only wacom please ! ) , modo many other applications composing editing like combustion premiere , it changes way you work better productivity , believe-me . pen tilt great " painter " software , what you maybe would take day finish you seconds literally , wrist sweep tilting pen you create amazing effects one second . also reduce stress your hand arm caused mouse , it improve your life quality not harming you like mouse when you get many our computer . besides it programmable buttons it smart scroll , so you may use you mouse only games after . important point - usb cable huge enough so you work confortably away your monitor screen tablet your lap if wish so . finish : i love my 9x12 wacom , if you buy it you love it too , give it accessories so this babe get happier * lol*a travel bag , replacement tips ( nibs ) kit , sure if you or need ... buy other pen like 6d art pen airbrush so you make extraordinary artworks . hope this helps your choice . best regards ! eduardo . janiszewskicg artist animato	1

first all , these good speakers , nice design but it one flaw . batteries ... . it eats them up ... fastb . if you use batteries instead wall plug it comes , it wont go loud , if it thinks your playing it loud , it start .. skipping .. or something sort . but , it good sound quality , honeslty when your go , when you really need it blasting ? also they just .. barley large enough you cant put them large jean pockets sadly , but it doesnt weigh much all . i really like how if i ever say .. lost my ipod somehow , it cd player ( walkman ) hook-up so they wont become useless if i lose ipod . ( wall hook up also comes many different adapters )	1

i bought these use my samsung z5 mp3 player . while packaged earbuds good , sound just drowning bass . i like good bass , but not when it completely overpowers everything else . i given sony 51 try promptly returned them ; they sounded ok , but kind made my ears hurt , $40 , they weren't worth it . i read some reviews these 828 , so i decided go these . sound incredible . bass well defined , but balanced nicely midrange treble . i literally hearing nuances music i didn't other buds . they fit very well ( though any earbuds start feel uncomfortable after period extended use , which discouraged anyway ) . set black foam earbud pads included . i always prefer use pads , but it course your own call whether or not you use them . pads wear out , but you buy exact replacements radio shack ( pack 4 $4 ) fit perfectly . personally , i usually end up replacing pads every few months or so . my only gripe 828 ( only reason 4 instead 5 stars ) cord too short my taste . foot or so would nice . otherwise , this great product around $10 steal	1

i've looking way fix dvds our toddler " enjoys " . obviously he shouldn't handle them , but he loves " helping " so how i resist . unfortunately he scratched up his favorite dvd point it won't play most sections . so this device arrives i run repair , buffer then repair , repair clean . my disappointment disc wasn't playable ... until , i tried using more than few ( small ) drops repair paste . using three big drops his dvd playable once again . i'm repairing cleaning dvds library too . if we still netflix this would indispensable . instructions clear device works quickly . its pretty noisy though	1
i received this unit via my home insurance after my rca 5-disc changer stolen . unit itself solidly built , i don't any issues playback performance or picture quality . i think if you get this unit , you'll pretty happy it . what stinks documentation , remote , setup . manual your typical poorly-translated engrish guide most people come expect inexpensive electronics . fortunately , if you've any experience setting up dvd player , there not much different here . unless you want progressive scan . here what you if you want use progressive scan mode : 1 . connect both component cables s-video ( or composite ) cable your tv . hopefully it both inputs ( most hdtvs ) . 2 . put your tv s-video ( or composite ) input . 3 . enter setup menu ( not confused options menu ! ) choose progressive output . 4 . now you unhook s-video ( or composite ) cable put your tv component input mode . thankfully this one-time hassle , but it still assinine panasonic couldn't either designed autodetect or used physical switch like my old rca . rca , i just hooked up component cables , flipped switch , set up dvd player 16:9 aspect ratio i . lastly , dreaded h07 error . i think i figured out what probably causing majority them : when you eject tray , currently playing cd/dvd still motor continues play . neat feature swapping other discs without interrupting your music , but upshot ejected tray empty slot it . you guess what happens if you accidently put cd/dvd into seemingly empty slot mistake ? avoid this , instead using eject function , use swap function . this stop playback make sure all discs out drive avoid damage . overall , great player price . just careful it bear tricky setup	1
i use it outside my deck watching dvds summer . it sturdy , easy move around , quality excellent . i would highly recommend it	1
while sports kit very reliable fun use , i found it still more mp3 player than training tool . better more casual mid-week run than speed work or keeping track details long training run . this not say it not great running tool . website great offers lot motivation . , you don't need wearing nike shoes use this . there many options ebay sports stores attach pode your current running shoe .... but i still like my garmin forerunner better ..	1

i bought this dvd player after my sony player died prematurely . it just me , or dvd players supposed longer life ?? this dvd player looks nice works fine when it working . player bit noisy when reading discs , though . but bottom line it just stopped working after only 1 year use . i expected improvement over my sony player i am sorely disappointed	-1
i recently bought this stereo my living room . i'm very very satisfied . it pretty easy set up . sound also very wonderful . bass treble features great too . 5 disc changer plus . i recommend this product anyone who looking good stereo . * note- ipod users need buy line-in order plug their ipod into music port .	1
this perfect my ipod keeps it totally secure while driving . great price you get different sizes match your car perfectly .	1
i read some other reviews stating this home theater system makes buzzing noise . however , i my doubts so i ordered it anyway it great . no buzzing noise mine all . i apartment didn't really want spend whole lot coin major system i couldn't really use anyway because noise restrictions . this system nice clear gives me home theater experience i looking . they give you plenty wire run edge room still enough slack hang rear speakers up behind couch wall . granted speaker wire isn't all thick , proprietary male/female connector into unit which would make upgrading monster cable pain . it still sounds great under $200 bucks why would you care anyway .	1
i bought 5 these computers house . i would got better ones but house auto generator so all i need 30 seconds power . i noticed review person saying there unit going battery mode even when power still ... my understanding this unit detects ( dirty power ) when it detects it , it then stop accepting ac power . i think software it comes allows you turn feature off or even turn sensitivity up	1
i trying find way easily carry lot camera equipment quite some time . i tried backpacks , shoulder bags , duffel bags , but none them really worked all well . then i saw lowepro street field system completely customizable pouches , vests , belts , accessories . it works great , you only get pouches you need so there no waisted space you organize them however you want according how often they used ( put frequently used items easier access places . ) variety alone this system worth investment , but quality ease use also very high which big plus . you get case any lens , camera body , or accessory you . i even cases my cell phone water bottle . one word caution , sure measure your lens lens hood backwards if you use them make sure entire thing fit into pouch , because sometimes lens fit , but then lens lens hood not . i often carry 5-6 lenses , extension tubes , teleconverters , extra memory cards batteries , bunch cleaning supplies other gadgets , which weights ton . but when they evenly distributed this vest/belt lowepro system it actually very manageable . only down side everyone staring you because you thousands dollars camera equipment strapped your body . but if you overlook , this way go . i used this system many zoos without ever problems , fact just unzipping single lens switching seems safer me than opening entire bag equipment every time you want switch lenses . many cases also come built rain/snow cover so if weather changes all your equipment not destroyed . you also put just few pouches normal belt when you just going take photos back yard or don't need take all your equipment , which nice . i really can't say enough how much easier this makes traveling lot equipment , if you hopelessly searching better solution , consider this , you won't regret it .	1
i two unworking disks ( one ps2 game other psx game ) so i picked this up both work fine now ! only thing you'll run it through couple times . if you run it through once you'll see little difference ... but price since it work ... eventually , i still give it 5 out 5 .	1

i started searching wireless surround speakers due configuration my apartment . wired solution simply would not work due location my couch distance my tv . after searching while , there only couple options available : sony dav-fx100w , system panasonic optional wireless option , wireless receiver kit made kenwood . after looking reviews all different options , sony dav-fx100w appeared like best choice . i'm very happy decision . dvds look great my hdtv 1080i upscaling feature . forewarned , if you wish use this feature you need purchase very expensive hdmi cable your tv need support it . i bought 3ft belkin cable ( instead monster ) it still over $100 . dvds also sound terrific ; surround impressive wireless solution . like any stereo , it important adjust levels each speaker , i pumped up surround speakers little well center channel . subwoofer , others stated , pretty powerful passive speaker . there could more depth sound , however , it out box solution i think it sounds good enough long standard output kept it default sound level . others complained cds don't sound good ; i disagree . i've played several cds i think they sound great . i also input my ipod through video1 audio inputs , sounds pretty great too . again , like any receive , you'll need play settings audio fields enhance sound your liking . overall , i'm very happy this system	1
sound this system really fantastic price , but i've same experience other reviewer . dvd skips constantly , phillips absolutely no help fixing problem . amazon great offered give 50% credit , but phillips insists i send ( my own expense ) machine them then wait 4+ weeks ' possibly ' refurbished unit . i'm quite disappointed phillips its lack customer service	-1
recieved present my wife , poor girl got sold this thing circuit city . anyway , it alright ... pretty average transmitter . thing broke immediately after it 3 month warranty expired . i contacted dlo customer service they rude heck . i understand thing off warranty but they no help all , wouldn't even offer fix it if i covered costs . so basically i useless piece plastic electronics . i bought monster icarplay loved it . it put together much better , better sound , no annoying little issues , more reputable company . don't spend your hard earned money dlo ... get something last .	-1

i've using neato ' mediaface ' software years . i love ability calibrate output so i create 2 sided cd booklets line up perfectly ! sure you little test printing but that what gives you control . this definitely not dumb dumber set . if you want software label materials ' designed your mind mind ' don't want creative control , then this not you . i use it cd booklets , cd labels , jewel case inserts all glossy paper folks think results professionally . if you don't want put effort , get something else . but if you like freedom express your creativity , this give you room you need	1

they okay eight or so dollars , but they don't last very long . then again , i used these digital camera so maybe that why they get drained so quickly . however , price i still would buy them again	1

i purchased this card canon a95 digital camera , primarily because canon sells this card their website because i read somewhere simpletech makes cards come ( some ? ) canon digital cameras . you read card specifications elsewhere , just let me say this my second simpletech card ( i also 256 mb sd card i use hp 49g+ calculator ) , both cards work well advertised . i definitely buy simpletech again .	1

we bought this device express intent capturing old vhs tapes putting them into dvd format . , it works bundled software meets need . however ! this ( vhs dvd ) long slow process , so don't kid yourself into thinking mpeg4 hw decoding this box going make super-fast process . actual " making " dvd movie still very time consuming , editing . i'm not so impressed windvd , but my son ( who most editing ) preferred its ease use over ulead product , which also included . we trouble one usb ports , even though all ports pc ( purchased less than year ago ) supposed high speed 2.0 usb . but using port allowed device found connected . i wish there some way tell if frames getting dropped . some video pretty choppy ( didn't look way vhs ) but i couldn't quite figure out what causing problem , it didn't repeat later uses . so far , we're happy we got it . if [ ... ] arrives w/o too much struggle , i'll even happier	1

i think this very good receiver . number people complained issues wireless fm modulator static causes . i would say there some static times , but most time i not this issue . however , i clarify statement , noting if you traveling long distances , you most likely switch fm frequency few times during trip ( my case it two hour trip sacramento bay area ) station you set likely not free entire time . however , it very easy switch frequency , so i able adjust it without any difficulties . receiver itself , i like compactness it it not take long figure out how go through various menus , save stations , etc . i not care much suction cup part car kit . although it worked fine my car window , i really didn't want it there , so i actually just use cradle place it one my cupholders , but this personal preference . i would definitely recommend this receiver my friends .	1
prossmallcuteself-powered - comes power adaptor . i 6 devices hooked up it , including 2 usb hard drives , it works fine without adapter - big plus me . most hubs would not work this setup . usb 2.0 1.1 - 6 devices hooked up , 3 low speed 3 high speed , all work very well . runs cool . consnot sure why , but they put 7 ports one side hub power/uplink ports other . this dumb . if you hub desk it looks awkward . all ports should back leds front . here , leds next each port which makes them completely useless you don't see them . hub very light so when you lots devices hooked up font gets elevated . overall , best hub i've ever i tried many	1

beware kingston rebates ! course , i hope your experience would differ , if you buy kingston product(s ) , but mine terrible . i bought kingston compactflash card offered $50 mail-in rebate . i promptly ( , day after i received item delivery ) went photocopy my rebate certificate upc code sales receipt ; then sent it all its merry way . yes , i well within rebate period , both purchase postmark date . my purchase valid retailer ( think huge online e-tailer ) . rebate required sending entire original upc label , which like entire outside package my cf card , size 1 business cards when flattened . no problem . two months later , i get letter saying " your rebate request denied because you failed furnish appropriate original upc code required rebate offer . " well , now what ? i can't re-send original ( it already their possession ) . i called , they insisted repeating what letter said . i re-sent my photocopies they said photocopy invalid proof purchase . after 6 weeks pursuing this , i figured this their scam . they simply wouldn't honor rebate . without original upc my possession , i couldn't really submit their requirements . if you're looking ram upgrade , i'd suggest you look quality company like ocz ( best ! ) , or patriot , geil , or corsair . if you're looking value flash memory card , i might suggest sandisk . one , kingston not make best products , they value-driven products . two , there competitors kingston just good or better value-to-performance ratios same prices . three , kingston not stand behind their customer i experienced . i urge you , please , cautious kingston their rebate scams	-1
less than dollar per sparkly frisbee , this best price i find frisbees . they don't fly very well they break relatively easily , but this best value i find 100 frisbees one place . lot people disappointed because they expect able use these discs writable cd media . problem , they don't work very well either . i , too , tested this myself . using nero burning rom , i tried many times burn different kinds data onto several discs - = 4x = - , just like you're supposed . it worked ! it burned fine . then it took 5 minutes open simple html document burned disc . subsequent trials run " verify written data " checkbox checked revealed every other sector or so unreadable after burning . it like writing white crayon , except this white paper . this persisted several other computers different cd burner drives even different software . i finally realized what great frisbees these things . cheer up people : they great fun ! so grab your spindle , go outside , start chucking these things your neighbor annoying dog . ps . i need sue memorex selling this junk . these disc just form abuse	-1

buttkicker adds bit shake your home theatre . it doesn't replace subwoofer , but sort-of turns floor into lower subwoofer . i love it . but there some things you should know . first , lfe kit ( amp ) probably best choice start because you can't drive it your receiver - not enough power . so getting game cost you around $500 . which more than aura bass shakers , but far better . second , one lfe kit sofa nicely , but if you , like me , mount it under your floor , you're gonna need two . possibly more , but probably two . because that lot more mass shake , otherwise they'll maxxing out making loud knocking noise . third , it not like riding rollercoaster . you'll feel floor shake loud sound effects , bombs , etc ., but don't expect magic . it makes movie more real , but it doesn't toss you around . all said , it great addition . if you afford cost-of-entry , you'll amazed how shallow system feels it off	1

i took time line read what other reviewers wrote this particular radio some other brands . i chose this over product even though they seemed same . this radios only one complaint , blue light . other radio , people complained setting up clock times . blue light not problem b/c we placed this our bathroom where it could listened while getting ready work , etc . we difficult time reception our house due signal towers foothill near us some products , like cell phones , some television cable companies , they not always work well here . so i concerned may issue this radio . it not only works great but i agree other reviewers sound wonderful . it holds up our other more expensive radio . i would definately recommend this product others who looking great sound	1

i owned forerunner 305 3 weeks . mine performed exactly advertised . gps rapidly acquires satellites i not problem it losing connection . i live hawaii gps no problem finding satellites ( updating almanac data ) providing fix while i sat my living room initial start . since then it occasionally seems take longer find satellites , but while i input my planned workout it continues find satellites time i am , it ready track my progress . heart rate monitor worked perfectly . it not once failed immediately display my hr . so far it worked better than my polar dedicated hr monitors . display feature allows you customize different displays up four attributes each out list over twenty different parameters . example , if you want know how long you left , how far you gone , your current heart rate , sunset while you exercising you make display just ! display illuminates well night . i found pace information very useful not all jerky . since gps not provide speed directly , 305 like any other receiver calculates speed based measured position changes over time . since those calculations tend provide pace information naturally jerky , 305 allows you smooth data varying degrees . it records raw speed information , but pace it displays " high " smoothing very steady useful . i not tried other pace settings because i am getting useful information . bottom line , pace information useful , but may require you adjust settings your personal preference . best part 305 how it effortlessly provides useful summaries your workouts , tracks lap lap performance , allows you transfer information computer . i update software watch ( firmware ) , usb connection , computer program so i may avoided problems plagued earlier versions . i very impressed how fast easy moving training plans routes watch historical workout watch computer . entire process took no more than 3 minutes didn't require any complex setup . once your training records computer , they displayed garmin software or number different third party web based software solutions provide different analysis tools , workout plans , trails explore . most features available online free . even if you don't use computer , watch stores long history previous workouts displays your previous workouts useful summaries . summary , 305 great tool runners who want monitor their workouts or keep accurate record their training very little effort !	1

this very well made cooling fan your laptop . however , if you 15.4 " screen your laptop hang off it inch both sides , 17 " inch half both sides . problem ? no , not really . you want air circulation underneath cool . 3 fans great . most cooling boards only 2 . earlier reviewer said he didnt like it because back " open " . well reduces weight increases air circulation . it well designed my opinion . on/off switch nice . it only work course if laptop running . you never forget turn it off . it runs amazingly quiet . you cant hear it but you feel it . it really meant keep battery cool help heatsink fan . cooler working battery last longer . it good angle work . i really havent found anything wrong it . i highly recommend this item , however , if i make suggestion improve it , it would add couple usb ports it .	1

this thing makes great photo prints , acceptable job black-and-white plain-paper output . but it costs arm leg operate . after i made 20 or so 8/12 11 photo prints ( standard-quality option ) it needed four six ink cartridges replaced . it also eats up eighth each cartridge priming pumps each time you turn it . so , this thing costs $10.00 turn . it costs $3.00 per print . you could take your prints kinko , tip counter gal buck , still make out . i'm going throw it out when my current supply ink cartridges gone .	-1

sound quality good but i really don't like style ... it smaller than you'd expect it , because image shown not actual size mp3 player . reaction time when you press buttons display screen ehh bit slow i'd say ... i just always happen pass song . i'd much rather buy ipod but heard it not most reliable thing ever . but i know fact ipods very quick , unlike this mp3 player . i'm shopping new mp3 player around $50 but found no luck getting sleek styled reliable one . i guess i'll just wait prices ipods lower . i not trust pre-owned ipods or any electronic pre-owned items , you never know how previous owner treated item before selling it online . also , this mp3 player only two colors really , silver white . earphones gave too much loud surround sound which i really disliked , so i used earphones my previous sandisk mp3 player . okay ... so maybe this mp3 player doesn't really many problems , but these just my preferences i just don't like overall appearance it . many my friends ipods they work well ... no problems yet , so i guess they're pretty reliable . also , battery mp3 goes quickly ... if you going long trip , i suggest you extra one or two batteries you . i constantly check see how much battery life left my mp3 display screen . i really not recommend buying this mp3 player if you teen like me , because you regret it . i found style this mp3 extremely unappealing while after i bought it ... time went i started dislike it more more . soon prices ipods lower , i'm definitely buying one . i ... like many teens look mostly sleek style ipods offer course reliablility ... after all , it very fustrating time after time buy new mp3 player because how unreliable it	-1

this great solution people who want always-on file server shared multiple computers . i think performance average this kind device , but if you only want access disk single computer , you'd better esata or usb drive which much better performance . performance especialy slow when you first access files , but i think might due power savings features ( server rated consume only . 6 amps ) . configuration extremely easy or without supplied configuratin utility through really simple web interface . documentation minimal , but you don't really need it long you know default admin account admin no password ( which i lookup online ) . one note , if i make this purchase again , i'd probably get 250 gb instead 500 gb drive i didn't realise how long it takes copy backup 500 gb data onto relatively slow server	1

i really like this printer ! very glad i dumped my hp favor this . most other reviewers covered everything , but i wanted mention ink refilling . this printer uses opaque cartridges , so you actually see ink level inside . this important because this printer set up recognize when you refill cartridges : if you refill cartridges , you disable ink level detector , machine records fact you bypassing their outrageous ink prices ( this applies non-oem cartridge replacements well ) . once cartridge used , chip not reset ( you epson chips proper resetter ) . therefore , ink level never known again , other than pulling cartridge out every now then checking it visually . pre-filled non-cannon cartridges : they don't come ink level chips . you remove one your spent cannon cartridge attach it non-oem cartridge . this doesn't allow printer tell you level ink non-oem cartridge -- it merely allows catridge used . i managed deal these annoyances , i lot high-volume printing , i am very careful refilling cartridges so they don't leak out into printer ( i.e. , i two sets cartridges , i leave newly-refilled one out machine least day make sure it isn't leaking once refilled , i use rubber plugs come most refill kits instead flimsy " tape dots " supposed seal refill hole -- they don't work ! ) . all said , this great little printer . it no fax , i haven't tried scanning function , but strictly printer , it suits my needs perfectly . i run printouts online business , so this thing gotten major workout already 6 months or so i've owned it -- much more than many you may ever print , print quality very good . it , however , require 5 different ink tanks , each which replaced/refilled separately ( no more wasted ink ! bonus , course this always good us ink refillers ! ) : 1 . ) black2 . ) black pigment3 . ) magenta4 . ) cyan5 . ) yello	1

i strong preference trackball over mouse ever since trackballs first became available because , unlike mouse , trackball requires very little space no physical movement other than rotation ball . i owned several mechanical trackballs various manufacturers over years but all eventually became difficult use because build up dirt their internal mechanisms . but this kensington optical trackball which operates very smoothly -- , optical , rather than mechanical -- should continue so . it smoothest operating most convenient trackball i've ever owned . i not any sticking problems commented previous reviewer ; mine operates flawlessly . if you've never used trackball before , please consider trying this one . you may quickly become trackball fan	1
pros : gigabeat considerably cheaper more capacity than ipod . it compatible plays sure vongo ( movie download service ) . nice screen , although suited more watching short recordings than full length movies . pretty easy transfer almost any video mpg or wmv player ( although mpg require conversion wmv through mediaplayer ) . cons : battery life not very good , i average maybe 7 hours . interface player much sloppier than ipod ( play/pause , forward track , back track side player pretty easy accidentally bump ) . mediaplayer very buggy program , when you set it up auto-sync there often duplicate albums other weird problems . i recommend using something else transfer your music videos ( even just drag drop ) . player slow response times when advancing tracks sometimes ( couple seconds or more ) . overall : though i listed lot cons , i really like player . it very nice not tied down itunes only major source legal downloadable music , battery life issue isn't all important me - it made it pittsburgh paris playing almost entire flight .	1
i talk landline or treo 650 all day my home office . i've using palm treo headset treo calls , my treo wired headset landline calls 5.8 ghz panasonic cordless phone , surrounded 2.4 ghz wireless internet signals . while this setup works , issues ( ) i am tethered desk ( often tangled dropping cordless handset ) , ( ) switching headsets hassle ( i not try wearing both headsets separate ears -- too confusing i want one ear available local environment ) , ( ) landline callers often complain they hear " echo " their voice treo wired headset , ( ) extra step plug my palm headset into its charger ( its lack low battery indicator ) results recharge it when i need using it . my ideal solution would enable me answer calls either phone single headset , keeping my hands free working my computer , un-tether/untangle me so i move around my office home , provide convenient recharging stand headset ( like jabra jx10 ) . my functional priorities : ( 1 ) 2-way voice clarity , ( 2 ) wearing comfort stability stay my ear , ( 3 ) range . cool style/design not significant factor . i stumbled plantronics 510 headset , which seemingly unique " multi-point " technology enabling it pair two phones same time . on-line research revealed seemingly well-designed desk phone adapter integrated headset holder/charger . value optional " handset lifter " hard assess without seeing it working . but entire system expensive ($399 list plantronics site , $300 other retailers ) , it requires wired desk phone--it not compatible cordless , due way it connects wired handset . however , i know plantronics manufacturer serious office headset solutions , so i figure you get what you pay . i read some reviews ( few available , not even listed treonauts site ) , found it web $210 , ordered it test it out . well , i've only using it 3 days , but it superb ! i dusted off old wired desk phone ( keeping cordless programmed numbers place calls ) , plugged everything together , paired my treo easily , kept all default hear/talk volume settings , charged headset - started placing/answering calls -- flawlessly ! talk quality , even my critical , hard-of-hearing friend no complaints . listen quality , i raised hear volume switch base one notch , now it perfect . handset lifter awesome ! i dial call cordless , then press call button headset ; handset lifts you hear call going through ; i hang up cordless . range-wise , i walk upstairs kitchen refill my coffee , step outside greet fedex man , * almost * get mail - which 70 feet base station ! conservatively it looks like i get good solid 30 feet , through walls , no quality loss ( though still only 10 feet if i'm talking treo ) . nice feature : if i * * go out range , low tone indicates this -- without dropping call -- high tone let me know i am back range resumes call ! receive call either treo landline , i just touch call button headset , which conveniently centered my ear . once you set listen volume good level , this only button you really need touch , it easy " find " . comfort-wise : very comfortable ! over-the-ear design keeps headset feeling solidly place ; smallest earpiece fits snugly my ear , but absent pressure other earpieces i've used ( gels ' hard ' earbuds ) . i hardly feel its weight my ear , there * no * pressure inside my ear ; i easily wear it all day . when i take it off , i stick it right into its holder/charge - so it always charged up ! packaging could use one very small improvement : headset eartip guide could use some verbal description , complement diagrams , selecting/fitting right eartips , removing them headset you try 3 different sizes . i am careful , discerning technology consumer , am aware real proof satisfaction comes after weeks use -- not hours or even days . i save all packaging return product not perform expectations . i tell you i am already confident 510sl keeper ! i post updates this initial review couple weeks	1

this works well , but few minor issues . i thought audio quality quite good . it also fairly good avoiding interference . however , if you stop playing button or turn off your car , it continues beginning file , not where you . music , that fine . audio books , problem , especially if each mp3 audio file 45 minutes long ! power connector end sometimes doesn't connect well you lose power .	1

i recieved this dvd player christmas gift . i know it cheap dvd player got it gift , so can't really complain . but i'll point out some stuff just case you're considering this one . screen : screen resolution isn't great can't really see much change adjustments , but dvd watchable it . compatabilityit plays dvd-r i've burned most factory bootlegs i've tried . some bootlegs audio off . don't know if it player or disk since some bootleg disks don't even play my panasonic or samsung dvd players , but disk works fine computer dvd drive . haven't tried any original disks since i don't any here . it also plays mp3 pictures . resolution pictures don't show up clear screen . battery:haven't really chance watch full movie it , but battery seems last long . i only charged 3000mah battery once since i got it . battery charged while use . cables : i like it comes ac adapter car adapter . i don't know why it doesn't come video audio out cable . it ports video audio out , but no video . :( i hoping able connect my ipod video it bigger screen when watching videos . bottom line . if you're looking cheap dvd player don't want spend money more expensive one , this one not so terrible . it light enough , screen size good enough . if you laptop dvd drive , you'll probably enjoy watching dvd more since it bigger better screen . i give it 4 stars out 5 , it cheap price it what it supposed even if it not exceptionally well	1

if you're like me , you probably wondering if these little cables actually worth money . i using cheap thin wired connections before , my receiver would lots background noise buzzing , so i thought i'd go ahead give these things shot . afterall , i listen mp3 all time my computer through my high end receiver . i'll tell you what , these things work great , worth extra money . now keep mind , i'm audiophile who very picky sounds . so casual listener who doesn't mind occasional background hissing or lack crystal clear sound transfer your computer your receiver , you might able find cheaper connection . but once again , i think extra $$ well worth it i highly recomend these . your only concern here economical one . far product concerned , these things top notch	1

dinovo cordless media bluetooth desktop , logitech produced product sleek appearance . product looks sharp mouse nice hand-feel . mouse rechargeable battery comes recharging cradle , so disappointment finding dead battery your cordless mouse relegated " old days . " when product works , there noticeable lag keyboard entry or mouse movement response screen . surprisingly , lag time seems greater this bluetooth device than my older non-bluetooth cordless desktop , but it not so long make product unusable . however , this product two fatal flaws . first , other reviewers found , my experience dinovo it crashes constantly . secondly , logitech no help whatsoever this product . keyboard mouse work less than 50% time simply not acceptable my needs . bottom line this product didn't even help my clutter problem my desk , because my corded keyboard corded mouse sit right next computer , rapid access whenever this product decides stop working . this product troublesome , unreliable decidedly not recommended	-1

i initially disappointed yellowness whites produced huey , but then i realized my eyes need calibration . i figured out after while , you go back " uncorrected " pre-calibration view then looks too blue . really test this , i got some test pattern prints web printed them good lab compared them my monitor . yup , thing works : colors matched . i don't know why so many folks giving it 1 star -- they defective unit or they possibly doing something wrong ? any rate , you get over initial shock because you've using uncalibrated display so long . extremely small size , quick calibration ( much faster than spyder ) nifty ambient light measurement capabilities , there no better product under hundred bucks . i've mine six months take it back forth work home -- it barely takes up any room my bag . calibration routine so quick i edit images my lunch hour setup doesn't take big chunk time . if i go through lengthy calibration routine , this would deal breaker	1

great little gps unit -- good bang buck , especially linux user . i surfed checked out number usb gps receivers , most not specifically mention linux supported . not only , but many support multiple data formats apparently require driver software change data modes . according holux web site , this unit worked linux they even offered drivers . i late model low-end dell laptop running simply mepis i use car , it got hassle use my old hand-held gps because i change batteries , stick mount windshield use serial usb adapter , not mention changing data format nmea mapping software i . ordered received this unit , plugged it into usb port , power light came , after minute or two started blinking indicate it good position lock . fired up my gps software laptop , position indicator right my house . took laptop out van , stuck gps receiver out sunroof , ran computer 36 hours straight while mapping various trips -- receiver worked flawlessly . if you run fairly recent linux kernel this unit should work just fine you also . well worth price	1

like everyone else i researched portable dvd players quite extensively before buying . i settled this model because 1-panasonic reputation , 2-9 " screen , 3-long battery life , 4- fm transmitter , 5-accessories includedwe just made round trip 6 hour drive picture quality very good , these things aren't imax , i am very particular audiovideo quality i would say you won't disappointed screen . audio thru headphones car fm very good . fm signal runs into interference you drive thru different markets but you just find signal readjust settings , very easy . base unit speakers adequate loud enough but don't expect high quality surround sound experience . controls easy use very simple . i originally going get lx-9 docking cradle , external speakers lots add ons . then i realized i probably wouldn't use any extra features price too high . imo , save your money , this excellent portable dvd player everything you would need . it quite portable , fits easily front seat arm rest console , very stable , long battery , includes car adaptor , ear phones , carrying case available rebate . i would recommend it	1

i love this player . i 512mb version but it same thing . i'm buying 1gb version today . pros : 1 . usb interface . no cords connect , just plug ' play . 2 . battery . real battery . not internal , rechargeable kind . quick-swap , good-to-go-in-10-seconds aaa kind . 3 . size . less than three inches . perfect size shirt pocket . 4 . durability . i dropped this player onto concrete 20+ times , sent it through wash , left it car -25�c temperatures , slammed it car door , lost it snow 3 days . yet , it still works great . ( looks like crap , but works great)cons : maybe ... 1 . no hold/lock button ( if you care that)2 . smaller style screen . 3 . sometimes while fast-forwarding , i accidentally skip song instead . ( probably just big fingers)overall , this one great player price	1

what happened monster quality ? 2003-04 , i discount monster cable through my employer purchased close $1000 ( retail prices ) worth their cables wiring up my home theater . i using gamelink s-video my ps2 works great . here it 3 years later i buy these gamelink 400 use my new hdtv component inputs . when i tried install them i thought i going snap connections off my tv because amount force i exert . much determination i got them connect . i switched ps2 experienced no video just sound . i even harder time removing them . when comparing these cables my older s-video gamelinks differences new wires lighter , rigid connectors definately too small diameter . hand , they feel cheaper compared heavier more pliable older wires . i no longer buy monster cables i not recommend these anyone . audioquest much better . too bad they don't make gaming cables	-1

i've owned this tv six months haven't moment trouble . i'm receiving hdtv off-the-air only ( no cable ) outside antenna , i receive cincinnati stations 40-50 miles away . i two wishes tv , though : 1 . it needs able download entire program guide , not just display information what shown now ( it wouldn't hurt set clock same way ) . 2 . tv needs automatically limit volume . commercials often much louder than programs . i'm wearing my remote control out . if signal gets marginal , tv displays " digital signal scrambled " even when it isn't . unlike samsung i owned , this tv doesn't blank out picture but freezes it momentarily if signal glitches . even wind trees this . if you cable or satellite , won't problem . overall set excellent : great color , powerful sound , wide viewing angle . black case fits into decor far better than some silver models . price , it good buy	1

i absolutely love this product . i'd give it 10 stars if i could . i tons auction selling ( i'm full-time seller ) . before i got this tent kit , taking photos frustrating . not any more ! since i bought this , my auction sales took off . i'm sure its because my photos look professional show off my items much , much better now . pros : ** excellent quality ! lights strong well made . stands lights very sturdy - these things won't tip over i couldn't break them if i tried . cube made strong , quality material storage bag keep it clean uses . i like backgrounds too nice material looks professional drapes well . ** easy use ! sets up seconds ! cube just pops right up . lights screw together you ready go . ** results ! photos i get now professional looking much less effort than before . tent eliminates any glare reflective items completely . before i got this , i trouble my photos turning out kind yellow colors off - but now , these lights , my colors prefect no more yellow photos ! ** tip : you use other fabrics backgrounds tent . clips attach backgrounds tent aren't attached fabric so you use whatever you want . ( i fun used christmas patterned fabric left over project sell my christmas related items ) . cons : i didn't buy this sooner ! it paid itself many times over higher auction closing prices sell-throughs because better photos .	1

i ordered these headphones after reviewing them 15 minutes . i expected regret when i recieved them , but hey , nope ! pros : incredible bass ( thump thump)- compare them ipod earbuds if you don't believe me ! also feels like music playing inside your head . hear vocals better- i understand what vocalist saying now ! i also heard some things song i never heard before while wearing these headphones . comfort- these headphones top its class ! couldn't more comfortable ! cons : cable : people using this your ipod/mp3 player ( like me ) , keep mind these stereo headphones , stereo headphones generally extra-long cables . just tie some it up , i it fine ! attention- these headphones bring attention yourself . not big problem if you're center attention , though ! overall , these headphones truly awesome . buy them right now see what i mean	1

my setup older hitachi ultravision 61 " hdtv , ( 2 ) bw 604 front , bw cc6 center ( 2 ) bw 601 rear speakers . i ready spend much more money replace my dead sony receiver but since my hdtv not hdmi inputs i didn't see poin t.t his receiver perfect my application . i only component video inputs my cable box dvd player . audio , my cable box uses single coaxial input . my dvd player uses toslink connector my pc uses one other two toslink inputs . this leaves me ability add one more component video toslink audio device . note : 5.1 setup connect rear speakers center channel surround set rear channel speakers " none " configuration . if you don't connect rear speakers this way you simply won't get surround sound . receiver plenty power intuitive setup use . remote easy setup but you press several buttons switch sources because there no macro function ( like higher end receivers ) . that not problem me because i use sony rm-av 3000 remote control which macro functions . don't mislead low price -- this receiver packs lot features money . if you don't need switch or upconvert hdmi , then this right product most mid-end applications . far xm hookup goes ; i'll never use it . i sirius i use streaming internet audio my pc through 50 ' toslink cable listen over receiver . my pc , i creative x-fi sound card optional digital i/o module . only thing missing receiver toslink output	1

we're upgrading our 15 yo toshiba tube tv . sdtv comes out so-so all lcds , pixelating somewhat annoying , but hdtv comes out superbly . we're getting in-the-clear qam analog channels cable , but i find tuner little slow , picture sound lags we compare it our old analog tv set . this might just digital tuners general . initial programming channels took long time , 5 minutes tuner scan all channels cable . we get 10 digital channels , rest ( ~ 30 ) analog . other reviewer noted , this tv actually fits standard cabinet , so we jumped this tv over some other models much wider bezels . 37 " size also perfect small living room , so you far enough back so you don't see all pixelation apparent up close . set simple matte cabinet , which what we prefer over glossy which i find distracting . menu system easy use feature loaded : you customize cc settings ( font , color , etc . ) each channel , picture size settings seemed remembers across all analog channels ( we usually leave it 4:3 ( natural setting )) , picture freeze setting very useful phone numbers , weather forecasts sports . incorrectly noted review there no built-in dvd player . but dvds nevertheless play very nicely , i'm using component video cheapo cyberhome dvd player , so speaks well built-in video scaling tv . composite video sucks , so don't bother unless you really want use your vcr ! not tried hdmi or vga , so i cannot speak those . sound good but not great . i not use srs wow because it distorts sound my disliking . srs focus good dialogue , but again , i prefer unadulterated sound . i use trubass low , but high it bit distracting . stablesound very useful feature , those annoyingly loud commercials . larger room , i would definitely use surround sound setup . i wish some things made easier though . there no direct way turn cc , you go into menu system turn it ( each channel ) , or mute tv . i find this cumbersome if i just want use cc occasionally . i would also liked direct button change picture settings , like if i'm switching movie sports , again you go thru menus this . power save feature nice , but it takes 5 seconds tv power , which takes some getting used . i also find channel browser feature bit useless , even though i am tuning directly cable , not using set top box . you cannot label channels , so i find annoying , channels all jumbled don't correspond actual channel number , so labelling would make it easier navigate channels channel browser . overall , i bought this tv because its superb picture quality , which something you cannot get cheaper set . features good , sound ok , but those not factor much picture quality	1

i given zune gift , recently . this isn't first mp3 player i've owned but it one largest capacity store data i've owned . up front i'll tell you i'm not hardcore ipod junkie , nor am i apple kiss-butt . i believe products work . said i see why people prefer ipod over zune , though i say zune isn't deserving some bashing i've read these boards people who believe it cool bash microsoft products just because they made microsoft . good1 . zune large , bright lcd screen easily seen sunlight . video picture quality good . 2 . sound quality good . factory earphones adequate delivering music though i pair philips earphones far superior only cost $20.3 . box includes data cable you need syncing . 4 . interface super easy use it easy get around zune environment i've not any music skipping problems 1.3 firmware automatically downloaded when i synced my pc . 5 . unit itself feels solid when held , slightly heavy though not too heavy . 6 . software loaded without problem my winxp sp2 system i no problem syncing machine when connected usb port rear pc . i all my non-itunes songs added player within minutes . 7 . zune allows you beam songs , pictures movies other zune players range . first generation player , it gets job nicely i look forward seeing what generation 2 bring . not so good1 . when i connected zune 4 port usb hub pc didn't recognize it there . i connect it back pc usb 2.0 port order get it work . maybe that design , though i'm not sure . once i this i no syncing problems all . 2 . i've never found zune range share anything . leaving wireless seems drain battery faster . i'd recommend turning this feature off until more people buy zune ( if happens ) . 3 . you can't buy music or movies wirelessly . 4 . although zune wireless it not compatible your home or business wireless lan . 5 . you can't browse internet zune . 6 . zune software no problem getting your music onto device , though zune marketplace vastly understocked compared itunes music store . 7 . zune cannot get music purchased through itunes ( this nitpicky , i know , but would so nice ) . there way work around this - you burn your itunes songs disc then turn around rip disc pc mp3s then import them zune , which i would rather than pay money re-purchase music i've already bought once . 8 . there no way re-organize files your zune once they uploaded device . say example i want throw couple pictures into picture folder so when i view my pics i don't scroll down forever day see them . i delete pic zune through pc software , add pic folder i want then sync pc player . folder added zune library order update occur . 9 . there no way change orientation photos or movies when viewed . i would like able flip them counterclockwise or clockwise 90 degrees view them portrait view instead turning player its side view landscape mode . one reason why this important when i set one my pics my zune background , i'd like able see just how much pic cut off since zune doesn't resize pic fit . oh yeah , that thing ... 10 . pics used zune background don't option re-sized fit screen . what i would like see change zune ( more microsoft than anyone else)1 . options re-sizing pics fit zune screen2 . options changing orientation pics movies3 . ability organize my files zune without delete file re-sync . i'd like able this player software both . 4 . since i use usb port back my pc longer sync cable would nice . 5 . put built-in wireless good use . slap compact internet explorer allow viewing web pages email ! you don't need keyboard view read-only content like weather , news sports it would really add player value6 . allow zune able buy music , pics video without connect pc . again , make use wireless capability zune . 7 . something zune marketplace - it just needs overhaul . it needs additional music , movies definite bump cool factor . 8 . make it easier customize outside zune . you this additional customizeable faceplates xbox 360 - same this player . if you hadn't noticed - individuality here stay	1

my original review below . it still stands if you may some these hanging around 2004 or before . shortly after i wrote this , though , maxell went pot . i throwing away more cd than i burning . it became so frustrating i switched fuji . these days , i would say fuji all purpose best ; hardly ever any malfunctions , no data loss yet . they also seem work fine any cd recorder . so , while maxell used great ( i used them cassettes all time back day ) , they decided some point cut corners rather than make product customers like use reliably . this point , change five stars one . ________________________________________________________________________for me these best cd market . i basically used this brand because they ones i generally used when transferring my albums cassette . same quality continues . i personally never liked using fuji or sony recording media past . tdk wasn't bad cassettes ; however , my record cd-r them 25 wasted discs out spindle 50 . i so far used hundreds maxells ( this line their others ) only one or two discs i discard due errors . also , all ones i made few years ago still sound grea t.t hese best cd-r both price performance	1
apple , once again , delivers yet fantastic product . after doing my research find 3rd party wirless unit , i found i no choice but buy airport extreme card my imac g5 . i'm using linksys router it works perfectly . i made mistake installing card first then plugging antenna . if you install this sure plug antenna first making sure plug all way tip collar ( which takes little force ) then insert card securly it seat . if you don't get very strong signal look card antenna again it more than likely isn't all way . it very easy install so if you comfortable opening up your computer it yourself . once you it installed that all , go your airport icon make sure it ... that it ! you're up running ! easy plug go !	1

i bought this card after i got logitech z-2300 speaker system . it made huge difference overall listening experience . highly recommend it , especially if you're currently using your on-board sound chip decent 2.1 speakers . you get optimal performance if you connect analog audio output your pc cd drive directly card rather than going through motherboard .	1

this my first mp3 player so i don't anything compare it but i love it . sound unbelievable , picture gorgeous touchpad exactly what i wanted . it sensitive but i use touch mouse keyboard very light fingers so it like it made me . that medium setting , sensitivity adjusted . there couple things i'd suggest would make it better but they're minor points . one , instruction manual pathetic . only thing worse user guide creative website . it actually showed menu options this model weren't actual device . but googling zen vision brought up lot discussion forums where all my questions already answered . other thing i don't like how it doesn't separate album artists contributing artists , making artist list three or four times long it needs . lot names i don't even recognize because they're collections windows media player grouped under various artist . i would preferred method sorting but when weighed against incredible sound ease use , it very small matter . i bought custom skin protect screen case it couldn't better . it easy put while you press buttons through it , it easy locations clearly marked . while i haven't dropped it yet ( fingers crossed ) , rubber feels thick enough provide some protection when i . altogether , it realy pleasure use i totally recommend it .	1

i replace my old receiver . i didn't want spent lot but still wanted quality receiver power . sony str-de898 worked extremely well me . it power when i want it sounds great . it some extras if you like customize it number preset features if i your not one experiment . it also more than enough hookups back side . i two satelite receivers , dvd player hd over air receiver hooked up they all well . only negatives i remote bit hard set my other units directions could more discriptive . but anyone familar receivers easily figure out all features . short , if you want good reciever without busting your bank , this one you	1
this telephone attractive programmable features those so inclined , performs well , provided it located fairly close electric outlet . if used home dsl internet connection , you'll probably install filter phone telephone jack . relocating segment back plastic body enables phone wall mounted . this not too easily because long telephone line must packed into interior bracket . dsl filter make phone hang farther out wall well . panasonic tells me they not sell longer handset cord replace short cord which they supply , so if phone mounted wall you may buy off-color aftermarket cord . wall mounted phone i should downrate it bit because these factors	1

although i found cheaper cable elsewhere same size length , i found out later i didn't need cable after all , so i sent it back amazon where i bought it . it looked like it would've worked well , but i didn't really need this cable . it got shipped earlier than anticipated date shipping . otherwise , i can't say much this product . find out yourself	1

all i've got say if all gps receivers worked well this one , then i would jumped gps bandwagon years ago . alas , receivers past didn't work nearly this well , nor other modern receivers what i tell . this this so sensitive i actually toss it my glovebox completely forget it until it needs recharged . now , if only i cigarette outlet my glovebox , then i would never even think it . said , it extremely aestetically pleasing i would never want hide it sight , i display it proudly my keyring !!	1
i read quite few reviews this other universal remotes i decided this one based price , looks logitech reputation ... i absolutely love this remote ! it easy setup ( once you get package open ;-) it fairly well built , but not any children i am not overly concerned rough handling , besides i would much more worried thousands dollars components getting damaged children than $70 remote you ain't buying one these some crappy old crt beta max ! if i any concerns/issues this remote it would ( others pointed out ) numerical keypad bottom remote , not disaster , just mild inconvenience also usb port cover not seem " seat " perfectly . there quite few reviews i read kill this remote due issues updates incompatibility devices activities not behaving right way , etc ... now maybe things changed last 4 or 5 months , but i zero problem software downloads/installations . logitech pretty specific order which setup their devices . moment i got remote connected cd installed it immediately connected website downloaded latest greatest software version . once you type your components information ( manufacturer , model number , etc ... ) software hits website downloads codes needed work remote . setup activities simple ; you " rename them " , change their order modify them any way you choose . one mistake i made this may something reviewer well when i " modified my activities " i never hit " update remote " button . i promise you , unless you some bizarre components some bizarre configurations or setups this remote answer your prayers getting rid bowl " remote control salad " you probably sitting your ottoman or coffee table !!	1

i got ( 2 ) these stands couple yamaha cp-33 pianos ; basically , free add-ons . i couple professional welded dual-x stands already , so i believe i'm position make fair comparison . assembly not really problem . it took me 30-40 minutes or so put both them together ; i work slow . i agree others included written instructions little bit confusing/not much help , but if you lay parts out ahead time , mentally think process through/study instruction pictures , you'll probably just fine . they logically go together , but my advice : take your time . think process through . i should also tell you second stand definitely went together faster easier then first . once together , i used ( 1 ) support yamaha cp-33 ( 40 pounds ; 88-keys ) stand-up church performance situation . no real complaints ; although overall , it not stable either my other dual-x . little bit rocking , true ; but nothing unmanageable . my guess home use , sitting down ( it center gravity lowered , it " feet " further apart ) , it should work well ; although you might hit stand legs your knees ! try sitting front one assembled before you buy it , if all possible . well , that it ! not much stand , really . but i would say money , you'll probably not able much better . that why i'll give it * 5 * . it fine ...	1

those whom this may concern , this case also fits ipod 30gb photo . case isn't tight people describe it but it fits perfectly . this case doesn't make ipod much thicker . it barely adds any weight fac t.t he plastic it made great . it definately scratch resistant ; it so strong you could use pocket knife scratch back your ipod won't even harmed . when you put case into jean pockets , it tends stick there so taking it out inside-out your pockets ( i hope made sense ) . this case not slid off dashboard either ( although i wouldn't recommend it ) . although packaging says it shock absorbant , i don't recommend dropping your ipod . screen protector wheel protector , i recommend you cut out piece paper protecter slip into case . hard plastic cases come also work but after you cut it out , you'll use sandpaper sand it smooth so it doesn't scratch you ipod once you put it . after you plastic case , you're ipod completely protected . only thing i don't like top too wide open dust tends get top . bottom case perfect ; it closes completely so case also acts dock protector . i ipod 20 gb also , this fits well . 40gb ipods , i wouldn't recommend it . my friends who 40gb ipod tell me it doesn't not fit . some able jam ipod into case but cannot good i t.t aking ipod ( 20/30gb ) out case very easy smooth . it not scratch ipod all when you put it or take it out . those people who sync thousands songs time , you should take your ipod out case because harddrive gets hot skin only making it hotter ... hot = bad . overall , this case wonderful . i wouldn't recommend anything this price perfect compared other cases . honestly speaking , i think these cases took less than 25 cent make factory i believe price outrageous . like i said however , compared other cases ' prices , this actually pretty good . pros : + long lasting material+ cheaper than other cases+ scratch resistant+ doesn't scratch ipod when removing/putting on+ you dock/charge/sync ipod without removing casecons : - you make your own screen/wheel protection- case top little too large allows dust enter- doesn't holes back let ipod " breathe " 5/5 ****	1

if , like me growing percentage computing populace , you use your laptop your main computing environment , i recommend you add pilotmouse laser wireless mini your workspace . you don't realize how much annoyance standard touchpad until you plug this mouse appreciate its wonderfully supple touch feel , epsecially when combined really nice , compact high-end mouse pad like 3m precise gel wrist rest ( mw307 ) . i like pros cons approach used previous reviewer this page . here mine : pros ---- * eye-opening smooth scroll * laser technology amazingly accurate . specs say " 30x accuracy improvement over optical . " believe it . * ergonomics mini really well thought out ( e.g. , little rubbery fins side ; profile height same your standard laptop ) . * nice " travel " configuration - usb antenna slides bottom mouse also turns it off process . kudos industrial designer little nuance . cons ---- * everyone note here , usb antenna pretty big ungainly . * i wanted deactivate my touchpad ( i'm cursed " phantom touch " phenomenon ) , but two occassions now when i've plugged usb device top pilotmouse antenna , mouse frozen up forcing me go touchpad resolution . * somehow , one point , my middle mouse got inadvertantly set relatively useless function horizontal scrolling . i tried use software ( which must downloaded ) set back vertical scrolling - i got it , but not without lot headscratching . not intuitive all i'll say there	1

this powermac g5 , or so label says . i haven't tried this older g4 computers so i don't know if this really needs driver that built g5 or something . i got this heck checking what it me . nothing really . 1 . first you know this adapter connects dvi port , not old adc port . what this means aluminum displays g5 model use dvi . this case , then you problem right there fight over port . unless you high-end optional nvidia gt card dual-dvi port , then stock ati 9600/9800 cards come one dvi one adc . so i would think people g5 or thinking upgrading aluminum display then you needing adc dvi converter hold monitor tv same time . makes using two " monitors " respective adaptors . why ?! unless apple envisioned phasing out adc port soon , it makes no sense . if they envision phase out adc then why release cards g5 still adc port if new monitors use dvi this adapter also uses dvi . they trying make money selling adapters ? 2 . i haven't seen perfect computer tv interface major video card manufacturers same way matrox perfected it . what matrox dual monitors one using tv it automatically routes video signal tv . if it detects your playing movie file , it just brings it out tv full screen . no need drag your windows into screen then making it into full screen . this adapter software interface doesn't it . it just makes your tv into monitor extremely low resolution , naturally . point adding tv monitor obviously put make multimedia viewing experience more enjoyable hassle-free . if you play quicktime file or dvd movie your computer , you would want it played your tv . nope , not here . you drag it then make it full screen . but it doesn't stop there . try opening application full screen tv monitors automatically switches back into one within window . very stupid annoying . so i believe they should follow footsteps matrox create custom software allow just . put check box if you want your video automatically output tv , window , first monitor , second monitor , etc . 3 . above suggestion actually works final cut pro application . but if you're video editor , you really wont even need this . you see once you connect your tv via this adapter then you route your tv your monitor which good check actual picture quality tv screen . it cheap solution . however , if you editing final cut pro then it would natural you either video editing card output tv/monitor while keeping your dual computer monitor active editing . or , you camcorder firewire output or some other similar solution you use route computer camcorder tv . using firewire actually better solution this adapter because it not allocate video card memory tv via adapter . using adapter connect tv you eating up video memory computer monitor tv . so if you 128mb memory then 64mb goes each . this slows down video information evident if you using big computer screens . using firewire video card not interfere allocates full memory your computer monitor . 4 . os isn't even perfect interfacing adapter . you connect adapter you'll need constantly restart computer whenever you connect/disconnect it . simply putting computer sleep waking it won't work . your video card still thinks tv connected despite no tv nor adapter ( after waking sleep ) . shut down computer , remove adapter then start make sure all video card memory allocated back your computer monitor . so unless you high end video card afford split memory interface automatically routes video signal your tv , this pretty useless . it just fun prove you output part your screen your tv hassle all . skip until they improve software	-1
weighing here , i think i add little bit more discussion this product : pros : * supports unicode character song titles folder names ( this means if your song title written chinese , it'll display chinese player screen ; because i unicode library this very important me )* supports multiple file types , meaning you not locked into converting all your songs proprietary format ( my library huge mixture file types iaudio plays them all -- so awesome )* x5l small -- much smaller than i'd thought * my whole cd collection fit onto 30gb storage room spare -- reason i liked this unit * bright , big lcd screen * it not ipod not made apple * volume easily adjusted without looking device * music libraries dragged dropped into player they ready play ( very important feature somebody who already their music library organized way they want it player)negs : * joystick navigation not intuitive . once you navigate up or down your song choice , you're going hit " right " joystick , right ? no , you press " down . " now you're ready go back so you're going hit " left " right ? no , you press " down . " baffling stupid * no " stop " button -- want stop music ? you can't . you turn off unit * order charge or connect unit your computer , add-on component required * ear-buds don't stay your ears cord different length each ear * protective case or belt holder not included unitin general i'm actually very happy this unit . like other reviewers , i waiting just right type mp3 player come out before i bought something . this comes pretty close . i carry my entire cd collection my hand which what i shooting , unit supports unicode titles folders . likewise , i able drag drop already-organized music library into unit it worked perfectly . so , this product good merit . what would make this unit superior product : carry-case belt clip included unit or available somewhere market . ( i yet find good one . ) power/usb connectors should right unit rather than special attachment . also navigation system should intuitive ; i don't mind joystick if system works , but its current programming clunky awkward . i feel very bitter sweet this purchase . it what its supposed , all right features . i'm glad i own it . but cowon would well listen these issues correct them next time around	1

this fine pocket radio people who need something small don't want suffer interference using ac adapter . mini300 takes 2 double-a batteries . fm/am reception above average sensitivity . however , radio newbies go crazy drift , radio inability lock into desired station . you're better off spending 10 more dollars getting sangean dt 180 , which runs only one small battery , digital , doesn't drift . if you want something standing alone your office or bedroom , i suggest you buy best radio currently available , kaito ka2100	1

pros : lot features such video playback , mp3 , organizer , alarm clock , voice recorder , fm tuner . using their software basically like opening up explorer windows . resolution sound quality nice . buttons instead touch pad allows more precise control . removable battery pack nice . there additional extended battery pack available purchase . speaker so you blast ghetto music fancy restaurant if you'd like . take compactflash card transfer data . many other fun features . cons : omg it huge !!! i honestly wasn't expecting it big . i thought " hm ... maybe little bit bigger than zen vision ...? " this thing almost exact same size my nintendo ds ! i just can't get over how huge it . it bit turn off those who might want use it exercise walk around . think super old school walkman but significantly heavier ! when delivery guy dropped it off , i shocked box so huge !! i thought they sent me wrong item ! then i opened it ...!!! i almost repulsed how prehistoric it looked ! more cons ... thing lags . it definitely doesn't operate nearly fast ipod when switching menus . i guess that because all things it offers . it get little bit tedious frustrating . even more cons ... lack accessories . i guess i probably won't need toughskin or protector this thing , because if i drop it , it'll damage whatever it lands , purely its size . overall , far functions this player concerned , i'm happy it . however , i'm still trying get over ridiculous size thing . i dare bring it out public ? what would my friends say ? would people stare ?! i highly suspect they laugh . oh well ... i guess i really only going use it play music car . i must remember hide it glove box before i let any passengers car	1
main reason i purchased this product because it supported 1920x1200 dvi interface . product works advertised . switching computers very simple they timing keystroke capture down really well . item compact fits nicely my server closet . my one only complaint usb keyboard port not pass-through usb port . i microsoft keyboard fingerprint reader when connected kvm none my computers recognize fingerprint reader ( only keyboard ) . only when i connect keyboard directly computers fingerprint reader recognized . this very unfortunate since i really enjoy functionality fingerprint reader . i trouble-ticket open avocent , but i am not hopeful . update : i got response back my trouble ticket : " currently avocent kvm switches not support fingerprint reader keyboards . due configurations additional hardware avocent not looking into support secure fingerprint reader access keyboards . use this type keyboard currently not supported device . " also , problem kvm if i reboot one my machines don't kvm port active machine rebooting , video display no longer works port . i usually remote desktop machine reboot it again kvm port active . very annoying . jay	1

i so excited get nav/dvd our new suv . however , i hate this unit ! you can't watch dvds unless car park . whole point me watch movies passenger seat while my husband drove . also , you put navigation cd everytime you want look new address . this means you remove your dvd or music cd put this special disc . you then park put your dvd back start it again ( we screens headrests ) . worst part you can't use any features nav system while you driving ! i pull over enter address or find point interest . while my husband drove , i figured i'd able use these functions . it not user friendly . we read manual still cannot accomplish tasks such programming radio stations ! i regret this purchase immensely . i not recommend this system anyone unless you willing put car park ever time you want use any its functions	-1
we bought this tv after reading glowing reviews only find out picture quality poor when viewed slight angles . also , after 13 months use ours now died . sound works but picture gone . cycling power on/off might bring back partial picture few minutes but then it gone again . expensive lesson	-1
we this tv since november 2005 really enjoyed it . we it delivered via amazon delivery option . delivery guys unboxed it outside house placed it floor because we hadn't yet found appropriate tv stand . my father law husband then spent day getting everything programmed . picture quality clear i've grown dependent tv guide which comes tv . we've no problems tv . we definitely liked ease competitive pricing amazon offered . i know some people difficulty shipping . we've found delivery people give you call if you request it , so you don't need wait around all day . person problem delivery people not hooking tv up him , i've never encountered delivery people who would . i ecstatic when guys who later delivered my tv stand actually took time place my tv top new stand .	1

it actually looking dozens flat-panel sets prompted me choose this one , i am entirely satisfied my choice . first dvd i watched lawrence arabia , it truly like sitting theater . few hd channels we actually get ( through comcast howard county , md ) , show promise all hd eventually bring . said , there caveat regard cablecard feature , which i wanted activate , , disappointing results , though it seems largely comcast problem , who claimed , after four tries , they couldn't guarantee compatibility . ( they powerful disincentive provide this service , btw ) . so i go cable box all its attendant wiring ; since this tv mounted over fireplace , it involved fair amount extra holes walls . since i bought this , price even come down bit more , which expected , but overall , this set provided best " bang ( lcd ) buck .	1
this product awesome ! it takes few minutes figure out how program s.a.m.e. but should not prevent anybody purchasing this terrific product	1
okay , idrops works -- just mere polish , it marvelous -- makes your device look shiny spotless . it remove scratches , but you gotta use some elbow grease , lots lots cotton balls , patient -- repeating over over , then over over again , then , over again . after , you'll probably it over then over again , before it over , then over again ... but you see results -- scratches greatly reduced , if you stick it , you remove them comletely ( but again , it'll take while your arm sore next day ) ... patience muscles keys here ! but diligent effort , it make your device look brand shiny new . your biceps delts look more toned too ! one thing -- i bought this my new macbook . most my scratches underneath , back edge , where printed insignias apple information ; thinking idrops safe mild , not realizing printing actually top , i quickly removed one insignias where it says , " designed apple " -- poof , polished it almost all off -- careful around printed areas	1

sony hmd1g hi_md minidisc now little bit more availableand really good idea . it major improvment original minidiscs which only held 60 mins ., 74mins ., 80mins . new one holds just under eight ( 8 ) hours music or datawhen recorded standard play mode . quite accomplishmentfor sony . i agree other reviewer who opines thatsony not seem making decent effort " sell " theirproduct . it almost if they want this format go way " beta " or " dat " one would think sony would want recoup r+d money invested this format . i personally thinkthat $6.98 disc holds much this one great buy	1

i tried out my new pet320 fairly satisfied quality finish product . i played one each , dvd , vcd , audio cd mp3 cd , my surprise dvd audio cd gave out relatively lower volume output max volume than vcd mp3 cd . but fair say volume levels enough enjoy movie distance 2-3 feet , which would your normal viewing distance this 3.5 " screen . audio seemed sound more crisp while using rock equalizer settings rather than default . one thing i not test though volume levels when you some disturbance around , i think it might need lot desired area . picture quality good player very rugged compact look , it would fairly safe say disc mechanism would reliable owing philips brand name . you get what you paying more , since lot stuff bundled together package including car kit , pouch , av cable earphones among other things . it would great if philips threw small remote price , but maybe future models . retractable stand could annoying beginning , but once you get hang how much force you need apply it just works fine what it made . i connected this my tv picture quality perfect , only thing volume won't increase much beyond certain point even if i crank up tv volume . ideal places where you cannot carry your tv you , still need dvd entertainment	1

overall it good product except two things : 1 . usb way too short , little bit over 1 foot . lacie , what you talking ? it probably costs you only one dollar add some extra length . whole point external hard drive its portability short cable doesn't give you . 2 . usb interface , dc power , power switch put all one side , but led indicator other side . again , dear designers , you ever tried work your own stupid design ? you know how awkward ?	1
this usb-hd what it supposed . i no problems so far . it extremely silent . external ac adaptor bigger than others i've seen . although its design porsche , it nothing more than steel box feature surely must not influence your buying decision . it comes formatted fat32 maximum portability among operating systems , but if you use winxp you probably want reformat it ntfs create some partitions over its 465mb formatted capacity . process takes well over hour	1

i got this tv few days ago so far i am very pleased . picture hd very good , rivals some my friend sony lcds . setting up pc monitor shaky , but once you get settings right , it very cool(except sitting close long period time quite uncomforable ) . i am little displeased dvd quality , my other hdtv looked much better same player component cables . i heard tv not automatically upscale component images only those hdmi input , which would explain this . i plan buying hdmi capable dvd player see if this fixes issue . either way picture large improvement over my old crt . i would give this item 5 stars except tedious setup order get everthing working picture refined . i would deffinately recommend this item especially because its built hd tuner .	1

i want wireless headset skype maybe some gaming . i thought zx-6000 it , but it not . not even close ! first , sound get really bottom out . sometimes my skype friends sound like gurgly lagoon monsters , hungry ready feed . i can't hear mid or high ranges their voices . connection seems unstable , causing pops drop-outs . so i take it back , lagoon monsters may more coherent . initially i thought this skype problem but i plugged my wired headset i could hear them clearly . i like headset design , but it doesn't feel comfortable my ear . i imagine if my grandma took out her dentures sucked my ear i could get same sensation . it ok few minutes , but after , i can't take it anymore .... wearing headset , . volume levels fine volume buttons work , power button . call button , other hand , anomoly . it nothing unless you use voice windows live messenger . even then , you install software . button doesn't work skype or yahoo . but what annoys me most button would serve much better microphone mute button . this headset not mic mute ! volume mic mute controls essetial any headset ! how could you not mic mute ! so those my big gripes . few other things annoy me : 1 ) usb receiver large considering dongles come mice other peripherals pretty small nowadays . it also cord , which good if you want set receiver your desk , but i prefer just small usb dongle plugs directly into my pc . i bought wireless headset ... forego wires , not take one off headset add it receiver . 2 ) it would nice if headset bluetooth so i could use it my cellphone . it stands , it just works pcs . i know , i'm probably asking too much seeing how microsoft overlooked some more basic elements like mic mute ! i want use wireless headset , but there not much like this one . i regret purchasing this headset . i just hope my $[ ... ] rebate comes through soften blow	-1

title says it all . i put them my x51v year or so ago it still pristine . they're slick ( no stylus drag ) completely transparent . they require slightly more pressure i suspect they muddy positioning little bit but it hasn't problem me . far biggest downside getting them installed . backside slightly tacky though stickiness doesn't come off . it attract any lint or dust around once it gets backside it doesn't come off . no washing or wiping could budge it . display must absolutely perfectly clean you need clean environment ( i amazed amount lint floated onto display while i fitted first one . ) you also cannot touch backside or you'll leave fingerprint mock you until you replace shield . i use tweezers small screwdrivers other bits position shield . all they're pricey but they're still best units i've tried	1

despite misgivings concerning several reviews hk cd changer i bought it attempt gain better remote compatability my other hk equipment . hk rare feature allows you hardwire daisy chain remote control function your hk equipment each other . changer sounds great ... much better than sony changer it replaced . i it connected both digitally analog . analog more depth while digital more crisp . no mechanism issues . it make lot mechanical noise microchips seem busy doing something . but if you wait everything seems work smoothly . wife likes way it looks so much so i went ahead got matching dvd player . my system works easily theatre box but sound quality component	1
so far , i havn't any problems . fit finish looks good . enclosure nice quiet without fan . i havnt noticed it getting too hot . so it gets 5 stars me	1
product itself awesome . great size , big screen , easy use . other hand there some flaws . unlike other mp4 this speaker , even though its not loud all its still useful . thing no one writes order play video you buy program off there website which cost 30$ both , major turn off .	1
installed it yesterday , i couldn't ask anything better . everything works just fine . i bought it radio feature more than cd player , but other than fact am stations don't come , which more location problem course , everything works just it should . i guess i got lucky	1

it features it claims , software works ok ( my mac ) . it doesn't claim fast , it isn't . 300 dpi ( which probably all most people need ) , its speed definitely acceptable , but not blazing . higher resolutions , scans take quite while . price , i'm perfectly happy wait ( or something else while long scan completes ) . if you're graphic designer scans all day long , you should probably spend more faster scanner	1
got wap54gx out box , hooked it up my rv082 , uploaded latest firmware ( ver . 1.16 ) , manually configured it off running . works flawlessly . up now two months without any issues . also two wrv54gs remote sites . lots people problems these , but works perfectly us updated firmware ( ver . 2.37 ) . admit wrv54g crap till firmware update . could ver . 1.15 firmware issue wap54gx ?	1
so you want home theater . your wife says yes if you hide hideous stack black boxes . sounds simple . this remote makes it very simple . i shopped competition options monster massive home theater controllers . since my budget not $500-$1500 , i avoid big controllers . it monster universal . most my components " code list " worked perfectly just code . my tivo/directv exception . tivo code only made tivo work sat code only made part work . i used learning capability remote even though i program every button , it fast painless . rf features remote work perfectly also . i my components cedar closet 20 feet my projector couch . it goes through walls fine . powerblaster transmits ir signal closet not even facing components works due high ir signal it outputs . macros turning everything on/changing input projector also easy program work very well . $100 i paid this , it steal . there no way monster counterpart gives enough additional functionality warrant high price	1
when i bought this product year plus ago , there wasn't many reviews out there , even here amazon . now i remembered , i checked see there many reviews . it seems many issues this product dying which isn't good . however , those us product hasn't died , this product god send . i tv across room cable box . i 2.4 ghz wireless transmitter received while but once i moved , i major interferences microwave , phone wifi . i researched it found this product which claim no interference these devices . took risk bought this product . i am happy report it works great . limitations it : - it line sight it work well- when you walk front it , sometimes , it make sound crack , which pretty loud 11pm your wife sleeping- no use other applications such transmitter your audio system " traditional " speakers . still best product its application . strongly recommned it anyone , keeping mind what it can't .	1
i like this product . it low profile great value . i connected radio cd player it . radio should kick out automatically once cd player starts . my only minor complaint radio doesn't kick out until sound output cd high enough . i once played cd very quiet passage beginning , it didn't switch over until it got louder . if you just looking great amp you technically declined spouse or significant other can't comprehend , this amp you . auto power feature great . sound very clean faithful . i wish it subwoofer out . would make it perfect me	1
excellent product price . efficient , not too heavy carry around . slight hum voice track dependance remote . these minor points notwithstanding , excellent buy , would recommend it	1
this product works great , good sound , easily hidden . only draw back back speakers still connected together wires . i expected them independent not wired together , probably should read fine print if there any . good product hovever low price !!	1
i like simplicity beauty it ( it so different other mp3 players out there ) . i figured out how add my own ' genres ' how make it recognize my files folders ( retag your files , i simply use wmp it ) . i just need know whether there way make it pick up where it left : turn it off , then , then say minute 2:34 seconds last song played ( that 6minutes 14 seconds long example ) . thing : where you get it new less than $50 ?	1
this well designed product fits ipod mini perfectly , allows it stand upright so it doesn't get banged around etc . while syncing or charging . i bought two - one attached my stereo system used standalone charger ( playing music through stereo ) , second sits next my palm cradle attaches my usb 2.0 hub syncing my ipod . no gripes whatsoever , it very good looking product . i initially bought third party cheaper product , opening ipod too big ( though it works ) , it clearlu designed used larger ipods - it annoying led can't turned off . not very nice room where people sleep . it also looks cheap . apple ipod mini dock looks very classy , not eyesore slightest . reviewer who said:---here joke , dock absolutely nothing more than stand your mini . it comes no cabling it not come ac adapter ( $40 ! ) apple makes sure you can't get any idea what you buying until after you purchased it broken open packaging . --- my ipod mini came ac adapter firewire cable attaches adapter . they plug right into dock , nothing else needed make dock standalone charger . if you want use firewire connect your mac/pc - then you need buy second firewire cable . me ? i just use usb2 cable came my mini syncing	1

i looking bag just laptop power source -- something i could bring school my backpack full books . this case seemed answer- 2.5 inches . when i got it , i knew there no way it 2.5 inches ... it more like 5.5 inches ( i got out ruler , i know . 2.5 inches refers main chamer holds laptop . when you add outer pockets , it bulks up . however , it still very nice , sleek looking bag i am planning keeping it . i would recommend it anyone who basically needs laptop holder one chunky 15.4 inch dells out there ... it really nice , comfortable case .	1
i concerned keeping my new toy safe elements . this product fits performs perfectly . i am impressed fact it thin you really cant see it your mac book . i also like fact i put stickers other stuff my new laptop . reason i bought this product because i wanted some more structure my screen . i laptops before one screen break opening it up . i thought this product would give lcd more stiffness so far nothing broke . this product worth investment	1

i am returning this radio , even though sound very good -- except one difficult station -- reception also very good . i bought this use bedside clock radio . it no real controls except those found poorly laid-out remote ( bose some reason also just uses remote only ) . if you lose remote , or even if you can't find it morning , you can't operate functions . changing clock time , changing alarms or putting radio into sleep mode all take endless button pushing remote . it got very frustrating after while , but because i liked hd sound i planned keep i t.t hat before i found out radio alarm would sometimes just not go off . then machine sometimes jammed up when setting functions refused respond remote or off switch until unit " reset " . resetting unit means unplugging it , unplugging it means you lose everything but your presets ( you go through all cycles set clock alarms ) . final final straw caused me return it find new radio when it started losing signal local station ( but not sister hd stations transmitting same frequency ) . so , sum , i liked look , i liked sound , i liked hd stations , i hated required remote , i hated difficult cumbersome user interface , i hated buggy operation	-1
i bought this a/v switch switch my computer tv source set powered speakers . rca switch produced tons noise other channels , even while turned off . while using tv source , switch added constant " clicking noise " . also this not sold amazon but some " shoptronics " company . they terrible customer service make you pay shipping costs even if device sucks can't even what its specified . beware , not order this switch or shoptronics	-1

purchased surround bar 3 weeks ago . very nice sounds .. i'm happy it - one reservation . advertising leads one believe surround bar utilized wall , or stand . choice i made put it stand i purchased stand purpose . surround bar 4 " height , accompanying cradle it sits when stand-mounted , it 5 inches height . this problem - panasonic plasma i own , it stand , only 3 " above shelf which it sits - thus surrond bar blocks view lower two inches tv screen . weight , height , high center gravity plasma set , it not feasible think it sit high enough stand ( 6 inches over shelf ) accomodate this surroundbar . i explained it all my wife , she cheerily said , " we watch tv standing up see over speaker bar " . i laugh . all my plans clean , installation up smoke . oh well , live learn .. temporarily , i mounted it 2nd shelf . it looks quite good there , but there some impediment each end bar , stand-supports partially blocking left right speaker . stand i bought fits surroundbar perfectly top shelf 43 " , but shelf below only measures 40 " . i am presently contemplating mounting it wall above tv stand accompanying mounting rack but odds my goal home theater - no visible wiring . oh well ... it probably my own fault not knowing how high my plasma mounted it would partially blocked ... but pictures exist surround bar mounted stand , show no such problem . sound excellent . surround sound fabulous . yes , you need buy subwoofer full effect . i use exceptional mirage omni s8 . if not problem my planning surroundbar height , i'd given it 5 stars .	1

this psu looks great performs great . i am using it power asus a8r32-mvp motherboard , amd athlon fx-60 cpu , ati x1900xt-x graphics card , four sata ii hard drives , couple dvd drives , high-end audio card germany , other miscellaneous components . so far , it this without even hiccup . i fairly tall case , so it easy tuck extra power cables away . some folks may prefer psu modular cables , which i computer , but i usually end up using most cables anyway . connection main power cable , however , require glance manual ( least it me ) because all my motherboards use 24-pin connector , whereas ocz split their outlet power connector into 20-pin cable 4-pin cable . it not intuitively obvious me how these two parts connected	1

i got great deal this refurbished multifunction laser printer am mostly very happy it after few weeks light use . it features i wanted ( except duplexing which price jump up ) , but i honestly can't say i've put it real test yet . one critical performance issues me quietness standby mode brief lag time powering up print . i'm very satisfied both counts . scan quality my only real complaint . print quality speed good brother postscript emulation seems excellent job printing adobe indesign illustrator . copying faxing functions perform expected , although document feeder tried eat few slightly curled/crumpled originals . my only disappointment color scanning capability/quality . my brief admittedly less-than-thorough testing , color scans practically unusable-too high contrast blown out highlights no detail shadows . my test scan extremely noisy , mottled gradations , excessively saturated colors . i don't know whether scanner inherently poor quality or just hobbled very limited software offers far too few controls . i'm going look third-party software before completely writing off scanner . despite scanning flaws , price right i'm still happy i bought printer	1

this tv great . i it out box playing xbox 360 full 1080p no time . i love rotating stand it works great my place . i wanted leave review because these reviews helped me so much . i went best buy looked new model samsung next 40 " version this model . newer one slightly better picture , but me it not worth extra 800-1000 dollars . reason why because when i got this baby home fired it up i wanted nothing . i set picture settings my likings , which easy , i off races . only thing i would say could better , i don't even know if this really issue tv , but when i hooked up older gaming systems like nintendo nintendo 64 brightness adjusted see some games . this probably more because those consoles weren't made such tv , but they still worked fine once i made adjustments . i read all complaints sound i completely disagree . i love sound . matter fact i turn down often . way , you gamers , i some research found out xbox 360 fact play games full 1080p component or vga cables hooked up . microsoft released update last november added 1080p output , ( go ahead just google it or go microsoft website look resolution or cables section ) after you hook tv up console display settings 1080p option . therefore this tv great either ps3 or xbox 360 , games sure look gorgeous it . one other thing could've better tv remote . it very comfortable hand , but it reception pretty weak . i probably get all one remote someday . dvd look great it . sound output my reciever great . all functions what they should . buy this tv its steal . enjoy	1

they say , " little bit knowledge goes long way ... " if you live or near big city , this scanner absolutely no good because large metropolitan police forces use trunk communication system due large number units work one time . these systems aren't actually scrambled , but due high volume calls , it would hard single scanner unit keep track them so while you might able hear one end converstaion , you won't necessarily able hear other . this unit perfect smaller cities which use frequencies betweem 153.0000 169.0000 their police communications . unit also good tracking airport traffic , you know now , nascar events . best thing when scanning new frequencies access code book your area so you'll know what you're listening time . if you're technologically-challenged any way , you're better off letting someone who knows what they're doing program basic channels you . i like fact that it lot smaller not heavy its predecesors . it conspicuous mobile phone lot easier carry your belt without it getting way	1

you probably reading reviews this product figure out whether it would good purchase decision . if you're like me , you've read reviews many similar portable cd players found just all them so many mixed reviews it almost impossible tell which ones truly better than rest . i fair honest possible this review . so i just made plunge bought this panasonic sl-sx480 ( blue ) cd player . truly , sound amazing . . sound alone makes this cd player worth purchase . bass boost system here four settings : off , s/xbs , s/xbs+ , train . i found train pretty worthless . s/xbs delivers sound comparable any standard sony walkman out there , s/sbx+ turns your standars earphones into simulated 4-speaker surround system ! amazing ! sounds like quality i receive my home car stereo systems . it this amazing sound makes next part my review all more difficult write ..... anti-skip feature poor best . " no skip " gross exaggeration . i use this cd player while work , i noticed within first hour use my cds skipping once every other song or so . this even discs brand new no scratches . puzzled , i referred my user manual checked make sure 45-second anti-skip turned . it . i went full 8 hour shift these clicks , pops , skips frequently occuring , irritating me more each time . finally , i decided just take it back . i replaced it sony d-ej010 ( white ) . took one home put cd it , only find sony idea " dynamic bass " utterly pales comparison . sound . i felt like i listening cassette , tones bass so poorly represented . so i took sony back bought new sl-sx480 , hoping skipping , clicking , popping my previous one suffered just glitch particular player , not problem model itself . so i just brought my new one home , put cd i just bought week ago ( no scratches ) . it skipped . you judge . buyer beware however . what you gain incredible sound , you sacrifice playability your discs . ready some skips . should this problem continue , i'll just go back phillips , which not let me down yet . also , cd player itself very light thin , i not dropped it yet but i cannot imagine it would very resistant hard use	1

i've my th-37px60u couple weeks now . i bought it because i read many enthusiastic reviews very few negative reviews , particular consumer reports [ ... ] rated its 42 " brother highly . i needed panel would fit my cabinet . i originally planning buy lcd , but when i stores , i impressed colors panasonic plasmas . i recall seeing cooking show , someone doing barbeque outside , flesh tones so forth clearly better than neighboring lcds . plus , best lcd panels cost more than this panel . now i this my house , i confirm when i am watching decent hd show , picture really terrific . rich , warm colors , nice blacks make image seem almost three-dimensional . my local pbs station shows three hours hd programming every night , many these absolutely beautiful my tv . this signal right off air . tv native resolution 1024 720 , bit less than typical lcd panels ( but same 42 " plasma tvs ) , but images my tv plenty sharp , i doubt i would see much more 1080p . but i some regrets . first , you careful aspect ratios such when watching 4:3 material , or movies 2.4 : 1 format , because you don't want view things sidebars or letterboxes because risk burn-in . ( particularly " break-in " period 100 hours . ) so you find yourself switching modes lot non-hd sources . i've learned you zoom things bit get rid letterbars wide screen movies , it nice " just " mode stretches 4:3 material way lessens distortion center image . ( zoom adjustable , very handy . ) if you wish avoid this , watch things without any distortion or croppinig , you might happier lcd . second regret my progressive scan , component output dvd player very disappointing this tv . colors look lousy . i tried replacing dvd player one upconverts hdmi output , which didn't seem improve things much . i am not sure if this inherent tv or just i got lousy player ( or if there settings i wrong player or tv ) . if you large dvd collection you might need consider this . my last regret plasmas something called " edge-flicker " . if you look bright objects against dark backgrounds , you move your eyes , you might see flicker ( hint dull yellow or other color ) . panasonic support web site says this normal . this isn't bad " rainbow sparkle " dlp televisions ( which i see loud clear ) . i suspect few people notice it or care it ( i reason believe i am more sensitive flicker than most people ) . if you sensitive flicker , perhaps lcd would better .	1

this ( 60 gb ipod photo ) my second ipod ( first , g4 40gb pickpocketed my napsack nyc subway - beware ) i've it over year . looking over spate recent negative reviews here prompted me respond . most shrieking pans drooling raves divorced reality . i think it important point out ipod tool only tool - portable music player - compact digital device much common laptop computer . it highly configurable user many choices how encode music - which affects final results great deal . 1 ) scratching . front ipod shiny plastic . you'll need put it protective case . there extremely lively aftermarket . i bought nice silicon case compliant plastic panel covers display $12 ebay . it trick year later my ipod looks like new if i take it out case . protective case must considered manditory ipod . that it - now get over it . 2 ) all hard drive based devices any kind - ipods included - limited g-force tolerance . if you jog , it go into protection - ( music stops unit appears paused until you hit " play " again ) . if you drop it while it running , you might kill it - or cause disk damage require reformat . if you want player jogging or sporting ( skiing , skateboarding etc ... ) buy nano or shuffle or competing solid state player . memory chips no moving parts don't suffer these limitations . they just size limitation . 3 ) all electronic devices subject rf interference - especially digital devices . ipod nice metal body shield , but it crash when taken near power lines , radio transmitters etc ... 4 ) sonically all mp3 players vary quality based how much encryption you choose use . best sound use high bit rate ( 192k or above ) . apple offers proprietary schemes offer higher performance . competing open standards exist just every format apple cooked up . this skeevy apple ? perhaps . it similar what microsoft computers . love it or hate it - it part whole apple experience . i use apple lossless compression it works seamlessly itunes yields wonderful high quality rips . they portable any other deivce than ipod ? no . they work any software other than itunes ? no . am i complaining ? not yet ! i personally think itunes software best software ipod best player . down road if proprietary format limits me doing something i want i might start complaining . life full compromises choices . 5 ) you must turn off equalization if you care sound quality . sadly this true every portable digital player currently extant world . i expecting better apple - but it not so . every single equalization setting introduces audible distortion ruins experience audiophile like me . eq set off i get wonderful sound . 6 ) reliability dealing broken players - portable electronics take lot abuse . laptops shorter warranty periods than desktops because rapidly spinning hard drives don't tolerate motion well . this exactly situation ipod . it tough environment hard drive . there lively after-market hard drive replacement services . ambitious folks buy cheap replacement hard drives open market fix/upgrade their ipods . sure you'll scratch case getting it open - but it better than dead ipod . battery life issues - same situation . if you like tinker you this little cost . if you paying service it becomes more justifiable just buy new unit . this cost effective ? nope . but if you become addicted wonderfuly lifestyle one these players - you'll it . 7 ) audible distortion photo ipod becasue video jack ? maybe early units . i one don't any audible distortion when eq off . this unit sounds noticeably better than my 40gb g4 ipod . it better battery life too . 8 ) what music services ? it totally personal opinion - but i don't recommend buying music itunes or any other service . they all pretty much use relatively severe mp3 compression . buy cds get full resolution . then rip your choice compression . way you full backup you get all music you pay . i also feel music appreciation sometimes takes time . there many songs albums i didn't initally like , but grew love over time simply because i them because they album some more accessible hit . if we only buy hits - we never get know more difficult songs we end up shallower . i'll confess i'm dyed wool audiophile - kind who hangs sonex his walls puts specially made sound reflecting pillows his ceiling . i'm also , like lot audiophiles , opposed digital equipment general prefer warmer fuller sound analog sources ( like my very tricked out turntable ) . said - system shows you most one you use most often - me portable . years i high-end cassette tape walkmen , then portable cd players various stripes . ipod completely blows away all previous portables wide margin . ipod sounds way better than most stand-alone cd players - sonics comparable really good dvd player playing cds . this killer sounding portable when used lossless compression , etymotic er-6 headphones . it better resolution than my big rig ( rocksan xerxes turntable , audio research pre amp , proac repsonse speakers ) . granted this digital - so highs more brittle there less warmth depth . this highly dependent source material . recent recordings good engineers sound great - through headphones or played stereo system good cord via line out cradle . i get around 1500 songs - 135 albums worth my 60gb . ipod high enough sonically it function my test source critical listening back-end components or sharing music audiophile friends their house ( their big rigs ) . this " library " aspect biggest feature ipod - really life changing . i can't recommend it highly enough . my main complaint ipod headphones . included headphones not adequate musically satisfying listening . i recommend grado or etymotic headphones ( even bottom line ones ) . you don't need separate headphone amp - unless you source material unusually low volume . " earbud " type phones all garbage - avoid them like plague . other than - i'm really happy camper ipod	1
i agree case hard remove . like guy below , i panic because i could not open it again . but after i got it open it easier open after . so i suggest opening closing it few times before putting nano . nano fits snuggly case . dust still get inside so you might want open cleaning once while . case get tiny swirls minor scratch 3 weeks i've my nano . that what case so i'm happy its performance . so far , i haven't notice any scratches my nano caused case . this case also better than one sold agent 18 . this case crystal clear while agent 18 blurry/fuzzy quality . basically , countour design see through , agent 18 somewhat see through .. so this crystal clear case goes perfect my black nano . great thing this case you use earbud cord wrap around " hook " case allow you wear nano around your neck . i'm suprise how well earbud audio jack stays while you're wearing it . " hook " doesn't really work well my sony earbuds . apple earbud thick cord better . i haven't really used belt clip but it seems decent enough quality it hanging off your pants/belt . i would totally recommend this case . it its job keep nano protected . i haven't dropped it so i don't know if it pop open , but bunch reviews stated , it bit challenging pry open ;) so just remember open close it several times loosen it up . after this case work flawless	1

center speaker packs more punch than i expected , yet rather large i creative find way mount it top tv . these speakers use old style spring-clip connectors , but they still very good clarity when using gold plated connector ( i just use ones came my speaker wire ) . wire supplied speakers basic grey stuff sony always sells , expect spend pretty penny upgrading your wire ensure good sound quality	1

i am new world electric guitars , but playing acustic couple years now . so i bought new fender stratocaster , this amp . all i say holy crap this thing awesome . i don't even know what 3/4 little knobs , all i know i spend hours day messing around creating totally crazy sounds . this thing loud , i've only balls turn it little past 1/2 way .... when i this i tried playing talking my wife it useless , she couldn't hear word i saying . i can't imagine 3/4 volume or all way power . since i don't any experience effect pedals i really can't comment how built effects measure up , but rookie they sound pretty cool . i'm not sure i ever understand all features or how use them like professional , but that why i bought this amp cause i figured it would hard grow out casual player no aspirations performing public	1
i bought this system my oldest daughter . i so impressed its sound quality , i am ordering one myself well . it plays sd cards well , which great because my younger daughter disney mix stick , we play these cards stereo when she doesnt want listen earphones . very impressed . great alternative more expensive systems such bose .	1

i am absolutely pleased this cameras ability . i security technician over 6 years now install cameras well security systems , access control , networks , phone systems , ect . i'm not saying i know it all but i seen lot things hold very good understanding camera . 0.05 low lux excellent . this not meant night time camera . it designed operate very low light such parking lot streat lights . camera 704x576 resolution while still recording 10kb/s . most camera installed business companies only 400x300 or somewhere around range . others mentioned this camera freezing reviews i read , but not once since i bought this camera over month ago it froze . it took me minutes set up dcs-6620g my wireless network i not droped connection since day one . yes there camera out there cost more , but why spend money few extra features you " may " not need . i would seriously consider looking over this cameras abilities before marking it off your list possible choices . far technical support goes i can't verify either way . i small question one features they answered phone desirable period time ( tech support ) able help me . although , person sound bit busy if i just call . excellent buy , i know it bit pricey but i believe it worth it . just think it could worse , some wireless cameras go $1500+ .	1
i appreciate these batteries . now i charged batteries ready go all time	1
this great wall mount shelf . there aren't lot 30 lb shelf mount speakers out there . i klipsch rs-62s weigh 26 lbs each , shelves accomodate them . down side one shelves sent screws no thread ! also you install thise into stud , period ! when you initially drill , make sure you find wood shavings drill bit comes out . when you install drill other holes , make sure you measure ground top wall plate assure speakers same height . also , make sure before you your drilling deep , level plate using level you buy any hardware store , so your speakers don't tilt one direction or other . make sure top side top put plastic cover before you attach glass , glass faced so rounded edge front ! good luck	1
i'm so glad i purchased this armband . i first one nike it terrible . this one you see screen , ipod bottons work well it very comfortable . i used it 18 mile run forgot i it . if you want armband your nike+ system this it . don't waist you money nike+ version	1
i skeptical buying these speakers . after all , i replacing 25 year old 27x18-54lbs speakers . i impressed sound . we placed them 35x45 foot bulding ; 15ft ceilings . three quarter volume , they fill room clear , undistorted sound . they definatley worth every penny . i seen speakers cost more money don't sound good . good feature they indoor-outdoor speakers which good me because they unheated building . i would buy these again without hesitation	1
metalhead myself , i very much thought it might overpowered music ( phones . ) i read very many reviews these headphones , thought it right buy these . they compared shure , bose . but metal head , if you love metal , and/or rock , these headphones own especially double bass heavy guitar riffs . if you love rap , i acquired some see what these headphones could deliver , it amazing . 5/5	1

i ordered pepper pad 3 am process returning it . device great hardware point view . processor snappy , screen nice clear , navigation great . wonderful sitting around surfing net chatting . unfortunately underwelming software makes all tedious . surfing page all sudden either wireless driver crash or browser stop functioning properly . many software issues addressed 3.1 upgrade but trouble installing it no backup disks unable restore functioning version software . very cool hardware - not many umpc usable keyboard screen - part great . unfortunately tied pepper software there issues . if standard distribution linux implemented device would more functional . any attempts install other applications " user friendly " sort way futile . thunderbird no menu . firefox no menus . etc ..... built-in applications only option some those rudimentary best . talk example only supports aim poor job . if everything you plan doing web-based you're okay long none software bugs bite you . remote control some basic templates devices but if you any one off devices ( cheaper receivers/dvd players etc ) you'll spend time teaching it device your original remote - if you get work - never get remote learn my lg dvd/receiver . overall hardware good stuff - if someone gets linux distro working touchscreen keyboard would well worth it . but current state software i'd look elsewhere	-1

first all ... if you issue where you cannot change any items menu ... this : remote , hit " menu " button then press down arrow until you see " picture , " then hit enter , now hit down arrow until you see " mode " hit enter again . you should then see " power up " displayed . hit enter again get setting choices where you change mode back " home " if you showroom ... tv cannot changed any manner . i found tv actually higher standards than most reviews stated . clarity exceptional , it even picks up 13 hd stations via my antenna ; my last tv picked up only 6 . most hdtv standard definition analog signals not look well they " old " sets . however , olevia nice option where you take out some choppiness blocking setting . i would definitely recommend tv . i got it $749 would not take it back $800	1
somehow , i really really like this mp3 player . i like sony audio general they great job this one too . i no problems their software or hardware . it works even my 10 year old computer usb 1.1 . such small thing , this thing nice display screen , which makes it easy browse songs . fm great , it doubles thumb drive . it got sports timer , equalizer so many features . i considering ipod shuffle first , but didn't like fact it don't screen . headphones great i easily hookup my home pc speakers great sound ! only negative thing i see usb cap provided this player isn't attached player body it easy lose , but that not really problem , just got little careful . i'm surprised why some people written ' user-unfriendliness ' this player . i able pretty much everything it , i haven't read manual ( nor probably ;-)) . much better buy over ipod shuffle	1

forerunner 101 extremely accurate fun use . verified it several times . advantages low cost , buy your own rechargeable batteries don't worry lithiums or replacements . purchase inexpensive heart monitor if you want save all added expense getting combination unit . if heart rate monitor/belt goes bad you replace it cheaper . overall cost lower , basics there , batteries easily replaced , keeps good records . little more effort but not inconvenient . prefer it more expensive models .	1

overall this excellent portable , introductory 61-key keyboard . some things i like : 1 ) all buttons easy use . my #1 criteria . most keyboards , i think , hard figure out , but this one pretty intuitive . it easy change instruments , songs , etc . you not want lose instruction book though . there just few things i use rarely i need pull out instruction book remember . 2 ) split keyboard -- you play one instrument , like base or cello , left hand , instrument like piano , right hand , touch just few buttons . 3 ) built-in metronome learning . there also built-in lesson plan , but haven't really used it . 4 ) many instruments really good , especially horns organ sounds . 5 ) auto chord-fill . don't know how fill chord ? no problem . just hit any one or two keys left hand , keyboard fills rest chord you . some things i don't like : 1 ) " realistic " grand piano sound not particularly realistic . 2 ) volume very low , even plugged . i turn sound up 75% maximum get sound acoustic piano playing mezzoforte ( mf ) . surprised me given how large speakers . 3 ) piano not come any essential addons . not even power cord !! no midi cord . no sustain pedal . all these essential addons cost bucks . power cord $16 . add midi sustain ($40 $20 ) , you now add almost 50% price this keyboard . oh , don't forget stand , that not included either !	1
money you can't beat it . four kids i go through batteries case often issues generic brands . these batteries better than other generics i tried discount name brands . recommended	1
its level i think this processor just amazing ... eventhough your pc using over 50% it capacity , it still run other application any problem ... its really fast i recommed get better cooling fan than one it comes better performance ..	1
ok , so i've only this player 1 day . still , it exactly what i hoping it would . it plays all my " trouble " cds like home-made cd-rs some scratches . i love snap holds cover down . i love all buttons big directly front cover - very easy use . i went walk this sholder bag it never skipped . it auto-resume feature where if you listening cd then turn off unit ... when you turn it back it starts where you left off . entire unit feels very solid , like it won't break . i also like clean styling , no crazy designs , just good player . ~ user manual could little clearer , but little playing around everything makes sence . ~ one example it doesn't " stop " button when playing cds . you press " radio off " button . easy enough figure out , but it doesn't say manual . overall , great product . i'm very happy it .	1
i purchased this work my dv-camera some amature projects . i found sound quality some amature videos . i surprised great sound quality ended up using it some professional projects well . batter life also pretty impressive . i not think i changed out batteries over 20 hours use	1

mount works well . i read elsewhere people added velcro make mount more secure . i find if you make sure little plastic tab mount snaps into small hole gps , usually audible click , mount very secure . however , i must admit , i don't roughest biking ( jumping over logs etc . ) . i would given it five stars , but little trouble trying rotate handle bars . i kept tighten it up . seems firm now however .	1
great backpack if you're worried protection . it even fits my monstrous 10 pounder laptop too . problem i it it actually little bigger than i thought it going . part reason this i believe because it stiff ridge around it which protects laptop minor bumps , but it makes bag kindof wide . also despite it medium/large-ish appearance , it really cannot hold much extra if my laptop , charger , mouse there already ( given my charger size brick ) . it really won't hold much more than 1 inch binder all my other stuff . still , it nice bag if you don't need carry 50 lbs books , or whathaveyou	1

this my first home theater system . up until now , i using old kenwood two channel stereo two stereo speakers my old 27 " tv . i am no means home theater guru . we purchased this system go large screen lcd , it all-inclusive , i good experiences sony . all all , i would highly recommend this system , especially those looking easy answer home theater . i used hdmi cable run tv , only cable i buy . sound excellent ( my tastes , anyway ) , bass all i care my 20x20 living room . movies such x-men 3 come across exceptional channel separation . there may systems sound better , but money , this system awesome . now downsides : 1 . cables supplied 22 gauge use proprietary connections unit . it too much pain cut splice , so i ran them as-is speakers . sound still good ( loud i need , children home ) , but true audiophile needs prepared perform some cable surgery . 2 . my cox cable supplied remote not control receiver ( power volume all i needed) ! none codes i tried work , so i am left using two remotes power up all my devices . this may not sony fault , but it still sux . 3 . rear speakers not come angle mounts , but walmart cheap set $8 . they worked fine mounting rear speakers near ceiling . all speakers mounted flat wall , but if you wish mount front speakers wall angle ( instance , if you your tv corner ) , you make or buy some angled brackets . i ended up using miter saw fabricate some 45� brackets 1x3 " wood my walls . overall , highly recommended unit . some minor tweaking , this 5 start system . i not regret my purchase .	1
i primarily purchased this dvdrw drive edit/burn video taken my canon mini-dvd recorder . installation simple , i just swapped out my old hp cd/rw drive used included disc install nero dvd-playback software . drive tray action solid , overall construction seems good ( no lite-on this ! ) . read/write noise levels moderate , par other cd dvd drives i've used . discs recorded my canon using -vr mode immediately readable/editable , using included nero software allowed quick video importing , editing , writing full size dvd disc . i can't rate this drive long-term reliability , but since hp cd/rw drive it replaced lasted since 2002 , i'm sure this one go distance well	1

i invested good home theatre system but sound output lacking , i friend who recommended this product i forever greatful eq , my sound just excellent . i highly recommend this product you if you want good quality sound . it just great	1
maybe i am only one who this problem , but we bought this backup our disc jockey service it extremely unreliable , if it works all . problem connections -- we use two video ipods occasionally ipod mini . even provided adapters supposed push slimmer ipods forward engage controls , none them connect properly . i put pieces folded paper behind adapters push them forward more , course , not make stable system when you trying play customer . controls often unusable because ipod not properly engaged or music just stops playing . video ipod also sometimes just pops out plug , again , causing music stop mid-song . i realize this not top dollar mixer never meant used professionally , but shouldn't it least play most time reliably ? i wouldn't recommend this anyone . it waste money	-1
