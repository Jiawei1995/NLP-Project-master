" con express " lots action it , which great because this hides poor writing uninteresting characters . unfortunately , action isn't enough , stunt pieces shoot-outs , audience tempted doze off . city heat productions isn't really known producing films highest quality , so usually i go easy them . if this big-budget company producing this , i'd inclined pan it entirely . but i wasn't expecting much got little more than i bargained . action , most part , pretty good but nothing competitive your usual dumb action movie . flanery vosloo perfectly casted , but everyone else seems stiff add any more flow movie . vosloo especially appears enjoying himself over-the-top bad guy hijacking train containing deadly chemicals . film moves fast contains shades better movies like under siege 2 , con air , spy game , speed . if you liked those , you probably won't mind this one too much . just go easy it	1
while some critics argue dan brown research reasoning certain historical points , one thing these da vinci " debunking " presentations never able refute this : downplaying feminine role western civilization christianity , primarily catholic church , fact church still considered mary magdalene common prostitute until just few short years ago : 1969 . nor it possible refute recent polymorphously perverse scandals rocked church after centuries suppression may everything doctrinal distortions dan brown brought out open serious review . this institution trouble because it seriously out balance itself cut off its spiritual nose despite its face downplaying or denigrating role women sacred beings bearers light , when their healthy presence needed more than ever corrective some these abuses scandals . dan brown world great service showing how feminine role divine written out 2000 years ago , help peter whose misogynistic views women plainly evident scriptures even today still , quite frankly , shocking debasing . sorry , but upon this " rock " male dominancy built church . thank you again , dan brown , bringing these matters into light day so people know more their authentic history or least their own research make up their own minds which spiritual path best them which ones built two millenniums worth manipulations , obscurations lies . these obscurations lies happened through efforts group petty , insecure misguided men down through centuries ensure their dominance control over masses , they found way dominate not only minds masses but their vast material resources , worth trillions , through guilt , control other hidden but consistent abuses power . those orthodox faith who continue blindly support such hypocritical institutions lot more answer than any twenty dan browns put together . people angry they angry failure religion live up its own standards behavior distorting what may jesus ' actual relationship women his life -- or disciples just supposed members exclusive men club jesus head women species relegated second class citizenship ? answer these questions , some you finally turn your own heart mind change instead some literal interpretation truth , because not everything light found scriptures or printed page , especially after scriptures selectively riddled scissors reasons self-interest or spiritual corruption . next thing people should ask vaults vatican thrown open public view . lord only knows what plunder they contain	1
my major gripe this film comes down issue easily exploitable weaknesses part vampires . these extremely frail villains get reduced ash flash u-v lamp , vaporized slightest touch silver their skin , melted down less than second light sun . vampires supposed scary , but how frightened them should i if one taken out throwing clove garlic him . writers future vampire movies should work making these creatures night bit more formidable . first underworld movie would good model .	1
highly acclaimed . , i knew . i watched first 30 minutes , which 1/4 movie , before i decided hang it up . new lady moves into conservative french town opens chocolate shop . this upsets local church , even before she begins unleashing secret desires so forth her sinful chocolate . okay . you really carry 2 hours this single plot ? nope . this one boring .	1
my main motivation seeing this movie better understand reputation echo park , little area nestled next downtown los angeles . i moved echo park late 2004 . it depressing - vicious cycle drugs , dropping-out , domestic violence . it all here , told through eyes latina teenagers . it easy see woman hand direction piece important roles women played . i didn't care movie whole because it felt sluggish uneven . i also found myself not caring any characters . so-and-so gets shot , la la loo goes jail . whatever ! aside , though , evil neighborhood druglord called ernesto . it turns out my next-door neighbor real-life also called ernesto . luckily , it just coincidence	1
this hugely disappointing film . i not see it stage nor i want if it ever resurrected . it trivializes illness , death , god , heaven , range human emotion love all forms . i grown up post-aids world see so many problems far worse than aids . i am tired listening actors drone selfish pursuits . while america focuses such banal subject matter , larger more urgent problems clearly ignored society thinks it luxury still trying come grips sexuality	-1
i recommended this movie friend here college , because he spoke so highly it , i thought i would just buy it instead rent it . i definitely regret decision . if you're thinking buying it - rent it first . it dull obnoxious , not mention weird . only entertaining part watching this film making fun it my roommate ( which why i gave it 1 star instead 0 ) . however , if you're still interested , definitely rent it , you might enjoy it .	-1
movie one my favorites , works both romantic level , comic level . but where widescreen ? todays consumers more educated ( thank god ) they've almost stopped asking stupid question " why watch widescreen , you lose top bottom movie ?!

i don't want spoil this movie others i won't . cache french hidden alot left hidden . why son suddenly what he ? why he think his mother doing what he thinks she doing ? i didn't care one bit any charactors . this slow going movie no conclusion . if you choice watching this movie or watching paint dry , flip coin . i watch international films often usually fnd them more rewarding than most us made films . not this one .	-1

maybe i loved original one too much , but this version story not work me . i especially dissapointed music oompa loompas . stick first one . it perfect	1

i understand some fans would like see more their loved characters ( this series one best far i'm concerned ) , i understand need filling gap especually if show hasn't aired while tv : but i cannot understand anyone who buys this dvd any reason . you not need this dvd " fill gap your collection . " they same thing chobits episode 7 , damn recap . there no point watching it . series great , stick episodes both before after this dvd . trust me , i know how tempting it either rent this episode , get it netflix , or go out buy it outright ... but don't . you'll only sorry . there myriad reasons why company made this dvd ( posted elsewhere ) but what important it waste time money . great series ( a+) , this dvd = .	-1
this film starts out so promising . it could punchy dramatic piece nature belief , legitimacy concept free . instead , characters dribble into infantile sexuality , film becomes travelog . i can't believe this film found financing ... real waste obvious talent . effect ending trivialise opening premise , hence film winds up exercise meaninglessness unpleasant aftertaste	-1
i love speilberg films , i really , but fact he good director no excuse this crap . i just not like it , its not my thing . i can't belive richard dreyfuss turned down reprising his role jaws 2 because he filming this nonsense . if you want watch it , then go ahead , we all different tastes . however , if you want see real speilberg film , watch ones like duel , jaws , et , schindler list , jurassic park , lost world : jurassic park , indiana jones trilogy	-1
well , i just got watching this movie actually went out my way write this review . truthfully , i didn't catch last 20 or so minutes because i found myself doing other things around house could care less what happend . trailers dvd cover this movie very misleading . one would think they going see something great genre horror movies zombies group people doing whatever it takes survive . i'm big fan romero movies loved 28 days later so i thought this movie would cool australian take-off . i couldn't more wrong . nothing movie makes sense start . entire movie over top starting actors . everybody entirely too much dialogue except main character who hardly says two words during entire movie . she looks lost , confused , out her league . other characters include local pilot his pregnant girlfriend , " wacky " police sgt his asthmatic partner , bait tackle clerk who never screams during entire movie , our heroin character who won local beauty contes t.t he movie takes place small town austrialia somewhere . when meteors strike earth ( slam into people ) , it unleashes germ which causes people become zombies . our main characters all meet up try survive . however , aliens involved so story goes survival story beams light dressed capes floating around right middle big battle . viewer left wonder what going first , but dialogue story become unbearably bad , you find yourself not caring minutes tick . i honestly couldn't tell you much else because it just so terrible i just simply couldn't take minute more . bad acting , bad dialogue , over top effects , some worst camera work i've ever seen . this movie apparently took two years make ... imagine if they only one ??? portion this movie makes me ill bait tackle charater . he shows up out nowhere saves heroin life like bad clint eastwood impression ( big hat covering his eyes boot ) . then , he walks away . when he appears again , he able these matrix style backflips ( digging his " spurs " into wall/ceiling ) making two pistols jump over his back land directly into his hands . this guy ever miss ? what you think ? he manages kill 50 zombies his two pistols while hanging wall upside down . not bad bait tackle salesman living backwoods australia ! if you dig gore , this one ok ... but again , wayyyy over top . i no idea one bullet . 45 could blow someone half . our characters so clueless it actually takes them 3/4 movie figure out how shoot them head . i personally counted several scenes where character shooting police revolver somehow manages get 13 shots out 6 shooter . someone get nasa phone explain how you because i just don't get it . absolutely worst part this movie , without doubt , music . it never stops ! there never scene without music some reason ! it just makes what you're watching seem absolutely cheesy ! it reminded me 1950 serial/pirate swashbuckling kind thing guys swinging ropes jumping across gorge kind thing . soundtrack truly worst i've ever heard extra cheese included . they use up their budget effects ? probably ! i found myself wishing i could mute music during film ! if you're fan good monster / zombie movies , i beg you pass this one keep moving . it doesn't make sense , story amazingly weak , plot ... well , there isn't one ... you'll wish you could your 2 hours back . i know i !!!	-1

lord rings movies made superstars out dozens actors actresses . many gone star movies made lots money , but without awards critical recognition lotr movies . not so viggo mortensen . right after lotr he followed this awesome adventure story disney . coming out summer after pirates caribbean , this supposed disney next big live-action , summer adventure hit . unfortunately , it flopped box office . luckily , it made comeback dvd market , which where this reviewer saw it . all all , it great movie , probably one best live-action movies disney produced long while ; judging its ratings here amazon imdb.com . short , this movie frank hopkins , half-white , half-native american horserider who mired middle-age guilt self remorse . comes opportunity change scenery - trip arabian desert race . frank takes challenge his horse hidalgo they go . race across arabian desert tests both rider horse , introduces them cast characters only accomplished movie studio like disney could created . we strong-willed girl full innocence inner strength , fierce father tribe leader who suffers no insults his honor or intelligence , backstabbing fellow racer who smiles until final death , seductive beauty willing win any costs , arrogant prince no moral bounds , etc , etc ... it all reminds our protagonist his days montana ! during course race , which frank hidalgo win course ; both them tested limit . movie ends triumphal note both . rider redeems his guilt freeing hidalgo human ownership forever , freeing his consciensce past betrayals . soundtrack awesome , cinematography great , dialogue realistic , once , movie set foreign land actually uses actors area speaking language area ! my compliments disney cast crew this movie . i highly recommend it all audiences teenagers up	1
absolute best hitman hart : wrestling shadows . however , if you want newest interviews bret some best footage you see him his early stampede days wcw , this dvd get ! i'm so glad finally some excellent matches his dvd . my only complaint audio hart vs . austin match wrestlemania 13 off 2 seconds which doesn't sound like much but very noticeable when someone hits mat there no sound until few seconds later . but it not enough drop it down 4 stars . tributes his brothers owen dean well other fallen commrades including brother law davey boy smith , curt hennig , big boss man , rick rude , miss elizabeth others touching . they excellent job this dvd despite fact mcmahon give bs statement beginning bret " putting their differences aside " sake dvd . it very obviously dig unscrupulous shyster . if you're looking " montreal screwjob " match its entirety this dvd , you won't find it . it cut time ( bret said he wanted " de-emphasize " it this project ) but featured bits pieces documentary itself . thankfully bret hocking mcmahon shown several times which made me smile after opening statement mcmahon . highly recommended	1

there very few shows my lifetime i fiercely loyal , but now defunct `once again ' without question , topped short list . i admit my lifelong crush actress sela ward my main interest this series , originally . single , no kids , my late 20s during oa debut , i far out abc target demographic this show . i didn't expect like show very much , but i got sucked not because sela , but because show nothing less than fantastic . superbly acted superbly written , abc never gave this show chance find its audience , it bounced around time slot time slot until it all too early demise . even best shows need pitched correctly viewing audiences chance . premise story rick samler lily manning , two fortysomething single parents who re-enter adult dating scene after their divorces . they fall head over heels one , find life love ( then ) late 1990s far different than what they remember . adding children , careers , parents , ex-spouses mix just adds different layers complications challenges rick lily . most shows `jump shark ' some point during their lifetimes . while some could argue hostage episode s2 point oa , i disagree . once again always presented two kinds television : good , better . stories characters could fill you hope , heartbreak , or both every week almost without fail . best all - everything this show real . very little , if any , suspension disbelief required . perhaps best thing i say oa it only show i so passionate saving , i sat down wrote letter abc , asking them reconsider their canceling it ( part organized campaign other fans ) . while campaign wasn't successful , release ( finally ) series dvd allow those who loved this show then enjoy it forever , well allow those who didn't get view oa during its run discover it , they too , might find out why we who followed this show beginning understood this just beautiful story	1

" hell " meticulously produced some best cinematography i've ever seen horror movie . although story who jack ripper little contrived times , general plot interesting . all actors involved excellent movie grisly moments you'd expect , considering subject-matter . it keeps you interested involved whole two hours , not mention it looks beautiful . heather graham gang prostitutes put great touching performance , showing human side women unfortunate enough this profession victorian era , johnny depp amazing , usual , although ( others pointed out ) his english accent may little off , which i wouldn't know since i'm american . this film great entertainment i would highly recommend buying dvd ( if you rent it you'll more than likely end up buying it anyway , it good ) . " hell " makes great addition any movie collection .	1

upon seeing previews theater good company , my first instinct avoid it like plague . based apparent target demographic this film , it marketed horribly . trite title kitchy manner which preview clips edited reminded me too much those shallow adoloescent throwaway disney films - type hollywood routinely pukes out 14 year old girls . knowing dennis quaid penchant appearing such films , i assumed good company one those . recently however , i stumbled across movie opening credits hbo . " i'll stay long enough make fun it . " , i thought myself . but matter minutes , i completely sucked . writing intelligent tone often dark . this movie , surface appears natural born comedy , yet it resists obvious cornball pitfalls every turn . characters not 1 dimesnional buffoons , but written very believable people real problems . every time i smelled cliche or overly sentimental twist coming , film continued surprise me not taking easy way out . it perfect film ? no . good company not without its flaws . but they very few very forgivable . this one proof you can't judge dvd its cover	1

well folks , looks like we may most over praised movie current millennium right here . ( " crash " comes close , but film lot more detractors than this one , many those who liked it seemed so because they imagined , somehow , it would " change world " . ) my beefs not same most those who don't like film : i don't much care it may show unrealistic picture drug abuse , nor i find it overly depressing . fact , it isn't depressing all cause i didn't care . it just boring annoying , sometimes different moments , sometimes simultaneously . this not good combination . all right , here plot summary : jared leto , marlon wayans , jennifer connelly ellen burstyn all drugs , this really messes up their lives . i hate give it all away like , but there it . fundamental flaw this : i don't like any these people , so their pain doesn't mean anything , since all there this movie it absolutely fails any sort effect . maybe if aronofsky put more time characterization it would've worked , but now there just isn't anything there . far what actually movie , we've got jared leto stupid chunkhead who inane conversations his equally chunkheaded girlfriend jennifer connelly , who wants fashion designer , or something . beyond this we've got jared mother , ellen burstyn , who weird old woman marlon wayans leto friend who deals drugs him times appears headed towards big leagues . i particularly love how there no real attempt make wayans into person . he got one flashback how he wanted make his mom proud that it . doubly sad fact he most likable three . he least displays little life . connelly leto apparently just wandered here bergman film so dull slow it wonder smack doesn't cause them cease exist entirely . ( well , connelly actually coke , i think , but it fails liven her up any . also , i actually * like * bergman films i've seen , so that not really fair comparison . ) they love each other , apparently , but since i don't even like either them i'm not much interested . finally , burstyn mostly just creepy though her performance take turn hilarious she goes off deep end . perhaps it wouldn't funny if i cared her , but we've over ... i want you people know i'm not utterly heartless when it comes movies . i care characters , but none these people anything me , so movie dead water . good counter examples watch " trainspotting " , which drug-addict characters enough humor life likable interesting " bubba ho-tep " , film which displays plight lonely elderly 50 times better than this film despite silly horror-comedy mummy cowboy outfit it . other hand , neither those movies nearly pretentious " requiem dream " , so watching them nothing stroke your ego . still , if that all you want kinda find plenty films better than this one purpose . " requiem dream " isn't helped any darren aronofsky repetitive , derivative over-direction . trouble , this movie hasn't got any plot distract you how redundant visual style . there nothing inherently wrong any his tactics , but they're hopelessly driven ground , we see fast-motion thousand times , quick-cut montages million times plenty wonky camera-attached-to-the-actor junk , they , again , impossible not notice cause plot sure ain't drawing me . i imagine overdone , repeating visual style meant representation endless cycle found drug use , but doesn't make it any more pleasant or entertaining watch . score suffers same problem they use same handful themes over over . truth told , i thought this movie pretty okay first half , but then it really started grate me . it became evident no , aronofsky wasn't going introduce any new visual tricks no , these characters weren't going get any more interesting . i looked timer continuously last 40 minutes film , so uninvolved supposedly horrifying conclusion where all characters really get it bad utterly ineffective . it kind uplifting , really : now these tedious characters finally hit rock bottom i go something else . now that good ending . grade : d+ ps this 500 reviews . i doubt if i write 500 more , but who knows	1

david milch modern retelling black hills gold rush compelling it raw realistic . hbo , not censored any way it would commercial television , it provides us more honest rendering how human beings live act . this first season you'll shaking your head wondering if crazed gold rush days could so outrageous . right off i compared it gunsmoke , similar tale written produced television nearly half century ago . i think we're seeing things more clearly today . i think our artists more leeway their audiences won't sit still kitschification human experience	1
this film unbelievably good . i dvr'd it free speech tv , i watched parts it again again . every turn you blown away revelations this film , if you , like me , never thought much who controls mainstream media . first time i watched it i kept stop tape just cringe , letting import facts sink . talking heads people you may never encountered , but whom you unlikely forget . write their names down . check into their books . even if you don't buy film look list people it get their books . particularly incisive inquiries into most recent presidential elections . you there , i there , but lewis shows us ugly underside media can't afford let us see . this scary , take-to-the-streets stuff . finally , pappas deserves more well-known documentarian . if you put off michael moore whininess slightly embarassing approach , you may find new friend robert kane pappas .	1

menace ii society debut film directing duo hughes brothers , released 1993 height popularity " hood movies " . most other reviewers stated film extemely powerful look growing up l.a early 90 . movie grabs your attention straight away robbery liquor store controversial shooting korean owners , pace never lets up throughout . caine ( tyrin turner ) basically bystander opening scene o-dog ( larenz tate ) goes rampage , this continues throughout film , caine good person but very much victim his circumstances , whereas o-dog just " doesn't give f**k " . without going into plot details events film all conspire against caine it all catches up him inevitable ending . there also good performances jada pinkett mc eiht small role start samuel jackson caine father . while film very powerful sad realistic take ghetto life , it not without it faults , main one lack depth some characters . they never really explain caine relationship parnell , though he regularly refers him " like dad " throughout film . also several other characters hard sympathise their background never really explained ( something i felt better boyz hood ) , i find it hard believe parnell would cool caine relationship his girl . despite these minor faults film still great though ending particular tragic inevitable . one better hood movies early 90 , if your into them you should definetely check this out	1

' spun ' follows lives several methamphetamine addicts through their wasted , roller coaster days , but this not your ordinary ' drug ' film . ambience atmosphere so in-tuned this degenerated culture you smell illegal drugs cooking . giving plot away would moot , since it portrayal everyday life people this particular scene . so , what separates ' spun ' rest drug flicks ? gritty realism , hilariously bizarre scenes , atmosphere , some great acting , complete lack fear part creator director dive into nastiest behaviors expose them pathetic comical . sets what you see real life meth houses . dress behavior characters very realistic . my only real problem movie some jerk/flash camera work gets little annoying , but still serves its purpose bringing " tweak " screen . interspersed film some ridiculous cartoon scenes riot , two cops parody tv shows like " cops " " bounty hunters " , flash stills hilarious action music . i am going haunted forever spider mike ( john leguizamo ) scene where he jumping up down bed sock his unit while abusing himself . you'll see what i mean , leguizamo brilliant his role . mickey rourke proven himself quite actor , chameleon who adapt any role .

favorite steve mcqueen vehicle , sprawling western stretches bit too far . me , this just hip take western melodramas 50 . early scenes , mcqueen could helped cedibility great bit letting actor play himself adolescent . i believe this early harold robbins novel toned down into lengthy story . mcqueen character moves across land hunt those responsible killing his family , there wonderful life-changing moments . brian keith gun lore rapport mcqueen worth whole viewing . mini-scene within this adventure under-utilized , suzanne pleshette , swamplands louisiana . love nearly conquered , slowing story until mcqueen catches up karl malden his thugs . malden strong his scenes , but there too much horseplay end makes revenge bit silly wrong-headed , since any red-blooded man would run off pleshette anyway . right when you want mcqueen kill thugs , there some nonsense mission priest slows finish even more . cut-up shown tv , it tighter , more fluid story . like malden " left-handed gun , " film uneven crawls spots . we forgive this movie when sum mini-scenes not add up successful whole , fact editor not what best . i don't even remember what revenge mcqueen character end . 30 years later i watch movie see pleshette , keith mcqueen what casts 10 or so tv sitcoms never approach . kudos casting , thumbs down pacing .	1

this film gives insight into interwoven lives mike watt . boon more than overlook into band itself .

there lots passion wide sargasso sea book , but it mostly emotional . it extremely multi-layered novel work true master . film other hand just your classic , bad 1990s film , beautiful look , lots skin , languid copulation , heaving bosoms , bodice-ripping nonsense , etc next no substance . it no artistic integrity whatsoever , its shameless makers must surely know they lifted their middle finger spirit jean rhys novel when choosing make film way they . i unable feel empathy both lead character . much touted erotic scenes not developed what they lead believe , it also lacked much enthusiasm . they incomplete contributed little , if anything , plot . viewer only gets glimpse passion supposedly exists edward antoinette . therefore , they should either gone all way , tastefully ( no pun intended ) , or left those scenes out entirely . now regards plot this film there enormous holes , which perhaps could rectified reading book . but those who haven't read book , there should enough information film itself keep reader afloat . start it unclear what really going this family ( despite narration ) . why ex-slaves keep laughing ? ( something vaguely explained movie , though apparently fully explained book ) . why didn't parrot fly away ? what made mother go nuts ? no point movie mr. rochester " issues " , it , fully explained . man gets letter exposing his wife creole dumps her like hot potato , after ( christophene explains ) he one who came crawling her first place . what hypocrite . again , maybe this ultimate point , mr. rochester snob archetypical victorian englishman antoinette victim both his prejudice jamaicans . but none exonerates appallingly abrupt conclusion film . so , despite beautiful cinematography , this movie hopeless muddle . i'd highly recommend novel way : book you don't forget hurry . needless say i think you should give this insulting ( memory jean rhys ) film miss , especially if you've read novel : it'll just frustrate you , no matter how keen bit easy titillation you may feeling time .	1

curiosity entertainment kids teens given today , i happened watch this film tv few days ago . i could biased say movies aren't what they use kids , but this movie went beyond . this film depressing example how horribly some today youth growing up . i would not recommend this film anyway ( unless laughs its stupidity ) . film starts off our four ' rich girl ' characters strutting down street arrogance beyond words . arrogance , perhaps normal thing some teenagers . however , these girls appear filthy rich which very few kids could relate leaving them wonder why can't they rich little kids too ? goal these girls course - become famous pop-singers . unrealistic dream most but it seems moral film : " good life , you need become famous " . plot moral , not great one . characters little lessons , appalling . ' raven ' so caught up ' becoming pop-star ' experience she becomes completely self-absorbed . this probably one few morals presented well . don't become self-absorbed idiot . moving . our second character fails entirely bringing any good ideals . after some time working ' cheetah girls ' upcoming career she comes home throw tantrum her mother not there ( rather , she out boyfriend ) . real-estate agent rings her mother interest selling house , daughter picks up phone , rudely yelling agent how this house not sale ' because i say so ' pure teen angst . now she decides go out abuse her mother credit card all money it worth because this small episode . course when mum comes home , she not happy . but apparently it all ok when daughter cries out how her mother should there more her . perhaps if this real case child-neglect , this may ok . but this kid just selfish brat who needs find better ways get over minor issues . i really hope kids won't think its ok throw hissy fit next time they discover their parents go ou t.t he next character perhaps most insulting ' real world ' . raven makes occasional comment this character how trashy their fashion looks ( yes , their fashion looks perfectly fine actually ) . later film we realise our ' trashy ' girl actually orphan living poor foster home . it good idea ; however , this girl looks nothing like real ' poor ' girl . perhaps ' money isn't everything ' moral would fitted nicely here , but instead we're handed perfect fix : get your rich friends buy your clothes . forth character i won't comment i can't remember anything significant her . process becoming pop-stars course , very unrealistic , aside sell-out factor lip-syncing . ' cheetah girls ' torn following their original dream or selling-out just get exposure . their friendship hangs line because this raven refuses compromise . we given few inspiring quotes other characters which road raven should take this matter , then its all up wonderful climax res t.t he climax . toto fallen hole got dirty ( horrifying experience dog bearing perly white coat)poor raven so frantic , this obviously worst kind tragedy could happen life . god forbid we learn anything realistic like death family member or even this poor little pooch . perhaps case we'd even president united states turning up comfort raven , but no , it just dirty dog stuck hole , it only calls whole neighbourhood , police , fire fights local television news crew . such tragedy only resolve reconciled friendship ' cheetah girls ' . there we it . entertainment ... maybe . any benefits otherwise , i would personally hope not , they're not kind things i would like see kids teenagers these days . normally , if this film aimed higher audience ( ha ) i wouldn't see much problem it . but this disney film ... you know , ones meant inspiring kids , or least teach them some values life ? this just gave us insight disney own greedy mind .	-1

though i bought movie because i'm huge alan rickman fan , i found movie thoroughly enjoyable . kevin kine course wonderful , very amusing . alan rickman his best usual , mary elizabeth mastrantonio portrays fairly brave , courageous character willing assist kline character catch killer risk her life . touch suspense , this movie moves comfortable pace , i must say my favorite scene " stairwell scene " . absolutely hilarious ! if you haven't seen january man i thoroughly recommend it . only flaw ? not enough alan ! ( but , any movie he ever enough him ? not bloody likely ! ) . ok . after read other reviews this movie their thorough dislike it because it " overacted , bad , etc . " , i must state this movie not supposed serious . it comedy . semi-stupid comedy , but comedy nonetheless . i found what type movie it supposed , it works very well . it good cast ( lots stars ) , it doesn't take itself overly seriously , it just plain funny ! those found it disappointing ? perhaps you miss point . it not supposed thriller it not supposed taken seriously thriller . my opinion , " bad acting " cast perhaps supposed way . i said previously , i enjoyed film quite bit , i still recommend it alan fans anyone looking comedy semi-stupid satiristic ( sp ? ) " serious suspense movies " . take " bad acting " grain salt while watching this movie , lol . actors certainly	1
" four brothers " successful action film because it accepts its role action film . too many `entertainment ' movies lately trying something more process end up substantially less . i no problem experimentation within genre , but when so much experimentation fails it becomes films stick basics them justice become rewarding . " four brothers " just such film . it not perfect any means , times falls hopelessly into traps i mentioned , but when it sticks what it best it works better than any action films i seen while . john singleton finds pace tone drives heightens story characters doing so helps film could so drearily standard become something substantially more . rather than mere dull formula or misguided wandering , film achieves level lively entertainment , something which hollywood late trouble delivering . so what makes " four brothers " different ? first all story simple enough it more often then not bog down pace film . this not always true there certainly mid-film lull when various uninteresting plot twists revelations hold back good old-fashioned a@# kickings , but majority movie plot used progress , rather than hold back action . plus , nothing works better unapologetically violent exuberant action movie than story vengeance , " four brothers " best when not trying make any claims contrary . acting suits film also , especially mark wahlberg , who i often enjoy who here obviously enjoying himself , playing character boisterous aggressive enough suit wahlberg mischievous grin tough-guy looks . terrence howard icy cool always playing cop streets , barring overwrought performance chiwetel ejiofor victor sweet , mobbed-up head baddy , all actors fit their roles well . ejiofor certainly meant over-the-top , but just all scenes feature him , he just doesn't quite fit more street-level tone rest film . singleton often looks though he still trying direct music videos , which approach often works , often not . opening scenes " four brothers " great , singelton aptly sets tone action follow . scenes snow-covered detroit brotherly bonding played songs marvin gaye motown set real slick tone film works well . there stumbles , such heavy-handed thanksgiving dinner scene , but most part these sequences succinct enough establish genuine interest character , therefore , vest interest story follow . film picks up so pace , sometimes thrillingly , basketball game or various action sequences , sometime disappointingly , film insistence ill-fated blacksploitation sub-plot , but way which never boring . this ultimately true success film . it may reflection current state hollywood movies , but " four brothers " , all its faults misguided straying , particularly successful movie because it least never fails entertain . i fear i praised film too much here . don't get me wrong , i certainly rolled my eyes once or twice while watching ( especially very last scene ) disappointed more than few aspects film , but parts i critical disappointed mainly because parts work worked so well . wahlberg one reason , singleton astute eye slick entertainment , but main reason film worked because it content what : unabashedly shallow , lively , entertaining action film .	1

( six seasons already ? ) finds jerry bruckheimer-fueled train still rolling . season opens , grissom ( william petersen ) catherine ( marg helgenberger ) back charge forensic teams , this season delves little bit more into personal lives team . warrick ( gary dourdan ) got quietly married ( much dismay catherine ) , nick ( george eads ) still recovering still haunted his traumatizing event previous season finale , sara ( jorja fox ) clue her past revealed . bloody cases season involve such cases including whacked out cult , dead movie star , assorted murdered strippers , husbands , wives , etc . it amazing prime time ratings darling like c.s.i. still manages seem innovative , even though there so many spin-offs immitators flooding prime time using formula this show helped set up ( grizzled , veteran leader , hunky ethnic guy , nerdy , young genius , hot girl tight clothing , etc . ) . season end , brass ( paul guilfoyle ) critical condition , grissom given hard choice make . final frame season finale , you may bit stunned , which sets up current seventh season . all all , c.s.i. still manages pack punch , it still tops immitators every way , shape , or form	1
i purchased this movie because i love chris cooper actor because reviews very positive . i played movie yesterday boy , i disappointed . movie much too slow boring . i love mysteries hate dramas therefore i thought little personal stories throughout flashbacks actually detracted what i thought going good mystery story . end mystery solved thud don't get me started quasi luke leia moment end . please !	1

i searched reviews this movie before i saw it , didn't find any . people i talked not seen it , but heard it good . so i finally sat down watched it . acting top notch . it tightly scripted chick flick two friendships . one nursing home , one friendship retold cleo threadgoode during those visits . down side it very feministic , point portraying men general evil ogres . women would up arms any similar one sided portrayal women . kathy bates ' character went trampled everyone woman " don't push me " type . while much this funny , this one extreme other rather than middle ground . spite this i enjoyed first part movie . until surprise ending . while this gives away bit plot spoiler , ending involved unwitting cannibalism . this made me sick , i felt sick long time after watching it . i known how sour ending would , i never would watched this movie	-1
i am so glad i bought this survivor season ! i needed something watch i lay bed recovering back surgery , this perfect !! it definitely far better than first far i'm concerned . major players much more interesting than first- colby , tina , jerri , elizabeth , etc ., plus they endure much more hardship than first- fires , flooding , running out food , mike falling fire , etc . it much more fun watch survivor second go it , challenges harder , players smarter , outback terrain rougher than beach first season . great buy	1
really people , 5 stars ? while plot gantz seems like it would make great series , what achieved two seasons could two dvds . i kept wanting yell tv , " get it ! " i wanted know more characters i wanted see how they would overcome this strange situation they thrust into i wanted see more monsters . but alas , all i got dbz feeling fights going many episodes endlessly whining characters . art gantz beautiful . concept so cool . characters rich feeling . it just takes too long get point then leaves you empty confusing ending bad plot holes . definatly not 5 stars	1
this one my favorite movies i seen duval penn great this movieit cop working beat mixed up middle crypts bloods other minor gangs area , showing what cops went through those times history how some cops would sometimes cut some guys break but could wind up regretting it i would spoil any movie you thats all iam gonna say rent or buy it , either way you must see it highly recomende	1
clive barker good job original candyman . it truly cut above most horror movies . second movie medicore best my opinion but this one just horrendous . there no suspense all this movie acting deplorable . donna d'errico soft eyes but too bad she talks . lets hope this last sequel	1
i saw elizabeth first time when it presented bbc tv 1972 . i enthralled story elizabeth acting glenda jackson . i became quick fan both . facts ever present throughout , read several books english history era . thoroughly enjoyable acting , settings costumes utterly devine . must every home film library touch class	1
i caught glimpse this movie years ago i could not remember name but i know who stared it ... so when i went online get name this i pleased see sender it very good price ... thanks so much movie second getting it me so quickly !!! thanks again !!	1
any great art hinges upon how it able address conflicts person goes through one lives . ashes diamonds , tries bring out conflict individual trapped whether ends more important than means . he part revolutionary group assigned assassinate political figure , before assassination takes place , he affair bar girl . affair events thereof makes him realise futility violence whether revolution able achieve ends they working towards . brilliant film , best wajda it continue timelessness associated it	1
" killing me softly " one those scripts just don't give audience break - not only it set up improbable situation , but big " twist " end also mind-numbingly predictable ( unless perhaps you haven't seen thriller before your life ) . chemistry two leads also lacking ; fiennes brings some physical magnetism his role but far his acting concerned , he inexpressive bloke , while heather graham all too expressive - she overemphasizes every emotion her character supposed feeling making faces camera . besides , she not even attractive ; even her co-star this particular film , natascha mcelhone , blows her out water department . ending like when you ' jawbreaker ' candy your mouth , sweet good beginning but when you get inside its bitter sour . it obvious towards end movie it would turn out like it , i seen quite number bad movies figure it out so quicklyin spite all , chen kaige direction good , he creates some suspenseful moments . so i give film generous " ** out 5 " rating . but if you're heather graham fan you like this movie since she nude many scenes ; joseph fiennes fans you'll receive half naked perks .	1
excellent collection rascalism . we tandem teacher pet school out . these two films introduce miss crabtree ( june marlowe pretty teacher ) cycle . first one jackie cooper gang trying scare away their teacher potential sweetheart ( " she mean teampature " ! )-or so they think . school out features classic history exam-miss crabtee- " buddy o'donald , what paul revere say his midnight ride ? " buddy- " he said whoa ! " then we what amounts two very anti-racist gang comedies . pooch ( 1932 ) , white rascals band together help their black pal matthew " stymie " beard keep dogcatcher killing his cannine pal pete . dogs dogs ( 1931 ) , sherwood his mena mama won't let stymie come play dorothy wheezer , but guess who helps save day ? spooky hooky ( 1936 ) later generation rascals ( spanky , alfalfa , buckwheat , porky ) trying retrieve phony note their teacher . gang ( janitor dudley dickerson ) gets scared out their wits skeleton dark . even my nephews , who don't usually take well black white films , enjoyed this one . dog heaven ( 1927 ) not so hot . not one better silent our gangs ( which i usually treasure ) , this rather crude entry beloved pete trying hang himself ( rather graphically , i might add ) after his master joe deserts him yonug girl . comedic canine also shown using his paws hold up bottles bootleg liquor get drunk despondency . yuck ! keep kiddies away this one ! other than , typically great collection	1

i saw this movie when it first video , maybe 15 years ago . my sister-in-law rented it us watch she seen it thought i would enjoy it . it during thanksgiving holidays , i'll never forget how this little film practically ruined my thanksgiving ! i so terribly depressed after watching it , i couldn't get it out my mind . no other film ever struck me way . word wise : don't see this if you mother young kids ( my youngest two , boy girl , little time ) . you won't able get sophie " choice " out your head . otherwise , it great film , no doubt . superb acting , writing , cinematography , you name it . just terribly , horribly sad . period	1

i guess i understand why this movie so savagely criticized during it year release , 1986 . prince still enjoying huge popularity based largely success " purple rain , " both film soundtrack . critics love knock someone off pedestal , which what they prince those days . many claimed movie nothing more than ego trip . they couldn't believe prince nerve fire director then assume role himself . it all way too harsh criticism movie isn't trying anything more than fun romantic comedy . course , poor critical response alone doesn't usually keep public making movie popular . yet " under cherry moon " bomb he box office . probably main reason this movie , although shot color , released black-and-white . some unfathomable reason , general movie-going public more often than not horrified prospect seeing black-and-white movie . now don't get me wrong , i'm not claiming movie released color people would flocked it droves . i'm only saying it would attracted more audience if it color . i acknowledge this movie target audience prince fans . since i am one myself , most my life , i'm not most entirely objective viewer . but i make no apologies my love this movie . it not " guilty pleasure " me , because i proudly hold this one my favorites . i only seen it couple times before dvd release - unfotunately i missed it theaters ( i couldn't get anyone take me , i only 12 none my friends into certainly not my parents - though my dad went me few years later see " grafitti bridge " opening night , but that review ) . but since it dvd release 2004 , this become one my most-watched discs my collection . soundtrack killer , tunes make up one best prince albums ever . there even some great stuff heard movie didn't make album ( some which issued 12 " vinyl ) . plus , i think movie looks great - cinematographer michael ballhaus , who multiple academy award nominations his credit ( dp numerous martin scorsese classics ) . i wonder how movie would feel color , but i think black-and-white right way go . even though movie set then-contemporary times , it feel something ' 30s . there so many classic moments this movie , i won't try list them all . but here few ... christopher tracy ( prince ) giving his " bela lugosi eyes " ... tricky ( jerome benton ) tossing rose petals into tub while christopher takes bath ... christopher freaking out when he sees bats eatery ... " wreka stow " scene ... car race christopher mary sharon ( kristen scott thomas ) . acting , i've heard lot people saying prince performance no good . i don't see much truth claim . after so serious " purple rain , " it nice contrast see him so loose funny this . jerome benton proved he could just fine even without morris day his side ( " purple rain " ) - i'm surprised jerome hasn't much additional acting outside prince movies . obviously kristen scott thomas moved this , her first major role , become oscar-nominated , highly repected leading lady . how dvd presentation ? pretty good , such largely overlooked movie . widescreen transfer 2.0 stereo mix aren't anything phenomenal , but get job nonetheless ; movie looks sounds fine . features , anyone expecting full-blown special edition like 2-disc " purple rain " disappointed . but least it not completely bare-bones release - four music videos included , though unfortunately not presented optimal audio/visual quality ( though they passable , i would've preferred 5.1 mixes ) . highlight live performance " anotherlover " which taken never-released ( least not domestically , not sure if it saw light day anywhere outside u . . ) concert video documenting parade tour . mtv held interesting ( i . . - very weird ) contest determine where " under cherry moon " would it world premiere . ten-thousandth caller mtv hotline would accompany prince premiere , which would held their hometown . mtv ran special covered premiere party - unlike premiere " purple rain " unfortunately this program not found " under cherry moon "' dvd release . lisa barber contest winner , movie indeed premiere her hometown sheridan , wyoming - very unusual place big movie premiere . when asked what he thought town sheridan , prince summed it up single word : " purple .

baba ram dass one major spiritual influences my life during early ' 70 . i discovered his books tapes just time i decided change my college major anthropology religious studies . it books like : ' here now ' , ' only dance there ' more recently ' still here ' continue break through my rigidity thought open my mind heart new vistas understanding acceptance . i priviledge meeting ram dass back ' 76 after talk he gave shrine auditorium los angeles , ca . during brief moment his presence i experienced unmistakable flow energy emanating this ex-harvard professor , turned subversive lsd user , turned hindi guru devotee hanuman , monkey-god . i felt totally alive , empowered so bursting emotion i didn't get wink sleep nigh t.t hrough years i've met , or stood presence numerous famous spiritual figures wide variety faiths traditions i honestly say i've never experienced anything comparable what enveloped me night ' 76 i looked into smiling , grandfatherly face ram dass . seeing ram dass old , infirmed confined wheelchair since his stroke ' 97 takes little getting used , but once you gaze deeply into those mischevous eyes see knowing smile you realize he hasn't changed bit . least not concerning things really matter .

this one my favorite movies now , no exaggeration ! i seen it 6 times last week , thats only because 3 those times commentary , which way , 10 times funnier than already hilarious movie ! i showing this flick all my friends they all absolutely die laughing . if you love ucb you love this movie - if you never seen ucb , you still probably enjoy this . i can't stress enough how funny commentary either - its just matt walsh ian roberts riffing off each other duration whole movie - they say absolutely nothing substance production movie , its great ! buy/see this movie	1

i am not fan reality tv shows but i am huge fan lisa kudrow . there cool distinction her performance/presentation i seen most her work . i dying see this dvd since i didn't chance see it tv . i am not sure what could inspiration creators producers make show like this . i think it incredibly original show . it written perfectly every scene worked out detail . but definitely not show massive audience . when i watched show very first time , i million mixed feelings . i completely confused . i didn't know what think valerie or rest characters . after i seen it more than once , i able pick up more details written into show . it truly unique show many levels . lisa acting absolutely amazing . she nailed completely every single line scene . my favorite moments show valerie " personal video diary " moments . there so much irony those . i cracked up every one them . references she makes pop-culture past very refreshing appropriate . music used show plus . i love character valerie cherish . she lots qualities great moral values . actress i think valerie fans similar lisa kudrow fans . valerie bit outsider , uniquely beautiful best sense humor . i love her comebacks - i think they hysterical . her facial expressions so funny way makes her every scene original . valerie definitely someone , real life , i would love around me . i don't think valerie character " anti-phoebe role " any way . valerie just not phoebe . thing threw me off little , michael patrick king comment ( his commentary very last episode season ) , madonna " stole valerie look her last tour " . i guess he meant madonna red-hair look cover coad which legendary madonna/steven klein collaboration . i don't know what think comment ... so , sum everything up , this show takes tv level . it pushing envelope ... essentially , it positive message . it would " thrilling " if comeback comes back tv .	1
set 1986 , ballad tells tale ailing wealthy counterculture environmentalist ( jack ) his teenage daughter ( rose ) living abandoned commune . years ago it prospering but all members left , including jack wife , only jack rose remained . they spend their days quiet contentment , gardening , farming -- launching two-man guerilla attacks housing development other side island . living near isolation , jack rose develop incredibly close bond , one threatens become incestuous . terrified this development , jack asks his secret mainland girlfriend her two teenage sons live them . new ' guests ' unwelcome development rose life . she incredibly possessive her father retaliation this intrusion , she tries seduce two boys kill kathleen ( girlfriend ) . jack wit end eventually , things cannot go they nor they continue coexist new situation . he two choices neither which idyll . this where movie goes awry . movie keeps everything very natural level , no overwrought music , overreactions . this works most movie yet these events too alarming characters ignore . after rose tries shoot kathleen , all characters choose ignore rose unhealthy jealousy . they blame her behavior wild child-ism , result isolated society too long . while this case , it also annoying . rose character too much petulant child instead wild child . her acts became increaingly dangerous , more i wanted someone finally tell her enough enough . character jack equally unlikable . he chooses ignore his daughter unhealthy attachment when he fully accept it , he continues encourage it . this may fully organic development characters their relationship , but doesn't mean it entertaining . despite controversial relationship , movie vacillates smug boring . performances good , my favorite those paul dano , ryan macdonald , catherine keener girlfriend her two sons , there naturalness their acting oddly lacking depictions jack rose . perhaps intentional . jack rose not much real people they idealized environmentalist versions fairytale king his daughter , living grand isolation until advent evil stepmother , kathleen . only this case stepmother isn't evil new family more entertaining then main characters . there extraneous subplot beau bridges housing developer serves metaphorical commentary jack rose reltionship , but like rest movie it too smug meaningful .	1

this second dvd taylor mason , i fully expected some repitition , due fact many comedians tendency repeat much their material . however , everything fresh if i hearing him first time , it just funny first one . mason every bit funny cosby , if not funnier . he pokes fun himself , which makes whole thing hilarious , he load talent , his ventriliquism music adding it . great everyone	1
this great set any pacino fan . hmm , it great set even if you're general film fan ! scarface ( arguably al best film performance ) carlito way take you into latino crime scene . al oscar-winning performance scent woman leave you screaming quot ; hoo-ah ! quot ; week . unfortunately , though , they included sea love rather than one al better films such dog day afternoon or serpico . when godfather coming out ! all all , though , this great starter set	1
there reason why they talk " voice angel " -- it because charlotte church certainly doesn't acting presence one . her acting debut " i'll there " proof enough -- only presence its star got this tepid little drama into theatres , where it rapidly dropped out sight . rightly so . seventeen years ago , paul kerr ( craig ferguson ) love rats fling groupie concert . fast forward present : kerr discovers unknown him , his ex rebecca ( jemma redgrave ) gave birth daughter , olivia ( charlotte church ) , who now well-adjusted paper girl . problem , olivia kept secret her dad . rebecca embittered , but kerr wants get know his daughter , similarly olivia wants get know her father . music seems thing bring angel-voiced girl burned-out rocker together , but rebecca doesn't want her child follow her father footsteps . " i'll there " hyped months advance inspired life actress liv tyler , who , despite only her twenties , immensely interesting life . well , maybe someday she get biopic , because " i'll there " only similar one way : it involves rock star his daughter . otherwise , it boring every way tyler life interesting . forgettable script , not much humor goofy premise , movie doesn't lot going it -- it reads like disgruntled teenager absurdist fantasy , scripted church act out . not terribly interesting teenager , either . it gets increasingly ridiculous when olivia decides pursue music bond daddy dearest ; it obvious ploy show off church vocal skills . best said church performance times she looks sweet . acting talent , she bland best , but she perform some good songs , her voice pretty ever . just watch songs fast-forward her actual scenes . redgrave good job she , ferguson wrings some pathos his performance aging rocker . his only memorable role film , it shame movie didn't focus him rather than dull miss church . miss church appears chosen role glorifies her middle atrocious film -- also known britney spears approach .

i just saw dawn dead first time . i actually saw remake first , which i liked . , course , i've seen terrifying night living dead many , many times probably see it again this halloween . so going , dawn dead little behind eight ball , so speak . but considering large number preconceived notions i regarding film , i enjoy it would recommend it . con pro : con : i truly believe greatest horror films black white . dracula , frankenstein , mummy , diabolique , psycho , course , night living dead , me , masterpieces just wouldn't same if shot color . shadows darker , deeper more sinister . danger menace seem lurk around every corner . night seems fall over proceedings like shroud , waiting swallow up everything . perhaps it part director george romero satire consumer culture prompted him shoot film bright colors . however , i kept thinking spooky quality grainy black white photography first film dawn dead suffered little bit comparison . color especially jarring when blood shown . romero wanted bright , unrealistic quality blood -- sort like comic book . however , effect this make blood look like spilled raspberry smoothie . film very scary , but might more so romero shot it black white . however , romero wisely stuck philosophy original when it came casting . probably because budgetary constraints , he cast unknowns pittsburgh area film . remake dawn dead released 2003 good , but it big studio film recognizable actors like ving rhames . when actors people audience knows , there separation takes place . i thought several times during remake , example , there no way ving rhames could killed off early film he most recognizable star ( i right ) . part what made night living dead so terrifying we didn't know actors . anyone could killed any time . nothing sacred ( johnny gets killed off immediately , tom judy burn death become zombie food , karen dies kills her mother , etc . ) . romero continues this tradition dawn dead . we no history these actors , so it becomes easier think them their characters . most us no safety net knowing actors previous work , so we no idea who going live who going die . it adds level horror missing remake . overall , dawn dead worthy follow-up night living dead . like most sequels , it doesn't quite match up , but unlike most sequels , drop-off isn't much . romero jazzed up formula satire dark humor , but he still manages scare hell out audience	1
i state all my south park reviews , i love this show personally colorado i take great pride this show comes my home state , season 6 great many fashions my personal favorite professor chaos , ( butters trying supervillain but just doesnt quote get it right , simpsons it episode just name few great episodes . sputh park great its own aspect , i just hope they keep up all these new great shows time grows ..	1
this movie so touching magical . once i've started watching it ( can't even count number times i've watched it ) , i find it hard press stop button . buy it you won't regret plus , i think charmed " stole " gist this movie , if u catch my drift * wink	1
" tristram shandy : cock bull story " reminded me bit altman film--it story within story novel filmed -- but it really chaos life . it bit amateur film feel it , draws one into middle making film . film opens vignette vanity actors -- my teeth too yellow ? i look good big nose ? should i get chin tuck ? am i too short ? characters move out , it not always clear who who -- agent , nosy journalist , moneymen ( women ) , history expert , girlfriend , pretty assistant , babies . some scenes truly hysterical -- all you need know almost all sterne novel happens before narrator born , filming birth hilarious . this film not linear plot types , or those who bothered heavy british accents or mumbled dialog . it sly , quirky -- but i liked it much more than i expected	1

eagle landed may seen two movies , out synch each other . first very fine move driven ensemble cast just right touch wwii era characters . donald pleasance scary powerful , pathological himler , duvall trapped , brilliant intellegence colonel german high command , sutherland brilliant charming , ruthless ira spy . even minor characters well drawn not give off false notes . jenny agutter convincingly plays local young women who dragged her heart into events jean marsh troubling nazi spy who insinuates herself into english country life . " other " movie burdened almost impossible believe framework fantastic details plot , which two-squad group crack german commandoes kidnap churchill seaside report disguised polish troops , help ira spy who there less than week . course , armed only phony letter hitler urging himler , intellegence colonel going set this whole thing motion provide command , control liason . , germans going wear their real uniforms under fake polish ones , some reason honor escaped my understanding . anyone any undertanding hitler war machine , british homeland defense or wartime bunkering churchill , all this too much suffer gladly . so , fine cast moves , driven reacting events logical within framework plot , which incredible . end , personal stories characters win out , quite memorable , while plot line seems , narrator-like figure says secrecy portrayed event , like it " ever happened .	1

those who haven't seen this film , above line spoken william bendix refers constant japanese naval air bombardment wake island u.s. marines civilians endured base . i always fascinated " famous last stands " american military history , story wake island one most famous . this classic war movie , while over 60 years old , still very meaningful entertaining today . yes , some historical details missing , but brave determination wake island garrison wonderfully captured . brian donlevy , who usually stuck supporting roles , gets top billing this time great job . william bendix , one my favorite actors this period , steals every scene he his typical tough-guy-without-a-brain role ! many view movie portrayel japanese unfair racist , but remember this movie released only months after attack pearl harbor . special effects obviously dated , but they quite possibly best any 1940s war movie i've seen . director good job using authentic combat footage , except footage showing bi-planes (?!?) . course , war movie this old usual cliches present , but this movie aimed america cried revenge . there many scenes showing americans dying , yet eventual american defeat especially surrender wake island downplayed ( surrender isn't even included film ) . if you want know full story wake island , there several great books available . if you love classic war films , add this gem your collection	1

my wife i throughly enjoyed all six dvds this collection . we enjoyed it so much we both next set four dvds . while it not necessarily follow scripture exactly it very close . i am sure some things left out it would hard film . if you intersted historical background hebrews their daily lives struggles this great resource .	1

- reviewone way or , we people relate jersey folks " clerks . " me , i may not lived nj , or work crappy job , or girlfriend who gave oral-sex 37 guys ( 38 if i included ) , but i understand one key perspective one main characters : life full disappointments . " clerks " not disappointment , but it reminding tale how disappointments lead resentment , or least lead whining . i find it impossible give lengthy opinion film like this without hinting any repetition . what else this film hasn't said already ? some acknowledge effort kevin smith put this project , through sacrifice selling everything he , result leads this certifiable piece indie . i one constructive criticism " clerks " , i'm sure that irked many times , but still that one thing which hold film back what i think would truly awesome : acting . i don't mean obvious-amateur audacity flaw , it script . script smart cleverly-written , but when people actually reading lines , dialogue bit farfetched . some characters alright their acts , but others act like they're just reading script only hastened their performance just hide fact . randall sadly one others , though his role natural , his cohesive monologues anything but . seriously , no one ever talks like . then again , i'm criticizing people who no cinematic experience whatsoever . other than , " clerks " likable film likable characters , if you handle harsh obscenity , which it ... lot . i certainly like randall , despite my issue him , mostly because his outrageous personality . he say whatever he want whatever he likes , he doesn't give damn anyone , except dante ; he free-spirited crass manner very unapologetic . he a-hole fans rooting . dante not so bad other half , his " i'm not suppose here " mentality makes him relatable character . this film just taste " snootch-to-the-nooch-ness " things come , which created insane iconic duo jay silent bob : say what you them , these two won't stop . " clerks " dealt not only star wars references made geeks nerdgasms , but it dealt most thought-provoking subjects ever discussed , like ' not sucking your own ****' . no wonder movie cult hit mid 90s ; course , i only elementary school back then , so i didn't know much it . but watching movie proves this day , it still fresh , absurdly funny , insightful handle new generation . this del keyes , saying " they might not like us , but we like them .	1

just i said volumes 1 2 : batman animated series . boy i wait long time it finally grace dvd . but it out it great . same applies volume 3 . it introduces one my favorite villains : ra al ghul . all episodes ra all interesting ( maybe showdown least , because it not much batman - or him matter - little ra ) , plus i love ra ' voice . it introduces new hero too : batgirl ( shadow bat ) . you even get know some backstory alfred lion unicorn . i really like fire olympus - guy gets so confused running business , he considers himself greek god ( zeus ) he thinks batman his dark brother , hades . wait till you see ending . bullet bullock hilarious episode , not just because batman working guy hates him most ( though i doubt batman likes bullock ) . even more fun joker harley quinn ( judge joker trial ) . now essence batman ( my opinion ): his silicon soul , one greatest episodes entire series . i just can't describe it - see yourself . i like lock-up lot too - guy goal similar batman , only different methods . unfortunately , volume 3 episode i dislike most well - terrible trio . i also found bane pretty weak ( not physical sense ) compared comics . this dvd similar number commentaries ( even single video commentary ) , though only one featurette . so it bit weaker than volumes 1 2 . nearly same conclusion before : i watched batman animated series kid tv i loved it then i love it now . it something special , because this cartoon far cartoony ( unfortunately new batman adventures heading there , some episodes quite so ) . they just this great mood , producers series call them " minimovies " , that what they truly . believe me , many waaaaay better than actual movies ( not only batman ones ) . only exception this one gets 4 stars , because it less special features	1

producing successful sequel such truly new unusual ( not mention highly successful ) film ring daunting task . you can't just tell same story over again , yet any moves new direction apt decried loyal fans original . i usually try review film immediately after watching it , but case ring two , i allowed several days go - thankfully so because my appreciation this film grown over time . certainly , this film not good original - how could it ? after all , we've already seen samara all her glory , we've even spent some time well . shock value ring two just can't compare original . believability also rears its ugly head here , samara unreal powers grown , real sense , taken flight sequel . this no longer people watching tape dying seven days later ; remember , rachel freed samara well end first movie . she more dangerous than ever now , her desires changed - she wants more than vengeance now . i think it quite coup get hideo nakata , director ringu ringu 2 , direct here , but i think vision he brings this film also explains part disconnect we've seen some fans ring . japanese approach horror quite different our own . american audiences used shown things , oftentimes explicitly , while japanese horror much more subtle , symbolic , spiritual . it this cultural divide , i believe , leads some ring fans label this film poor sequel . adapting japanese horror american audience quite challenge - just look grudge , film even i felt just didn't work . ring , all symbolic clues , especially those videotape , basically led something - namely , samara story location her body . ring two not lay out such clear pathway hero or viewer ; symbology much deeper abstract this time around . it not this causes confusion part viewer ; it just much story plays out level many viewers not culturally suited experience . that why i would recommend watching all bonus features this dvd - they certainly helped hone my appreciation what i just seen . story , you rachel keller ( naomi watts ) her son aidan ( david dorman ) leaving seattle moving astoria , oregon shortly after events first movie played out ( it supposedly six months later , but hideo nakata says two years production notes ) . rachel still suffering somewhat sense guilt ( over passing tape other innocents order save her son ) , but she aidan both trying start their lives anew forget samara . that all well good , but samara not forgotten them . that obvious after local youth dies horrible death under mysterious circumstances - rachel quickly left no doubt whatsoever samara found them . we quickly move beyond cursed videotape , however , samara works exploit her unique connection aidan . this time around , rachel cannot save her son through anything approaching conventional means , nor she rely help anyone else , now including her son . increasingly desperate , she decides trace samara history before her adoption morgans , eventually finding speaking girl actual birth mother ( sissy spacek quite memorable cameo ) . it looks like all drama leading up fairly predictable ending - but just remember film never over until it over . naomi watts basically carries this movie her back , she filter through which we view everything happens . up until now , i never really appreciated watts actress , but i now . david dorman story me , though . while he able deliver some very effective scenes , times i can't help but think he attended hayden christensen school acting . sure , he little creepy , but now it televangelistic way - me , he looks like combination jim bakker young macaulay culkin . i love samara , though ; thankfully , nakata chose not go cgi route her all ( even still , she not half creepy her original japanese counterpart ) , which would made mockery whole creep factor . cgi used , unfortunately , deer dominate one memorable scene . i understand how real deer could not used , but this particular scene , after starting out very effectively indeed , ultimately ruined ridiculous obviousness cgi animation . unlike ring , ring two packed special features ( although we still don't get commentary , unfortunately ) . easily best bunch short film called rings , which sort prequel rings two . i really liked idea played over these 15-20 minutes - underground network teens who watched videotape , recorded their increasingly disturbing experiences long they could stand it , then passed it fellow newbie before their seven days up . this impressive short film , you get series excellent making-of featurettes featuring surprisingly lengthy set production notes , information cast crew , some nineteen minutes deleted scenes . altogether , it impressive package truly excellent , some degree , misunderstood motion picture	1
i really enjoyed this tv series when i younger seen every episode , so finally getting them dvd special treat me . seasons 1-3 great ! i looked up john amos ' character " james " . me , james what i needed growing up without dad home . so kid , when i first saw episode where he dies since i really looked up james , i felt florida evans family i even went into bathroom cried after episode because i didn't want any my family members see me crying . my understanding , john amos constantly frustrated voicing his opinion writing wanted see more positive situations written into show . i guess people cbs thought they knew enough african-americans who watched show assumed we could never relate anyone us getting our lives together actually moving up world . so they gave " good times " ultimate change : what could worse thing could happen poor black family both parents struggling make ends meet keep family together ? one parents dies or gets killed !!!! this exactly what cbs when they fired john amos , they killed off his " james " character insuring he never returned . now florida single mother taking whole load herself without strong pillar james hold her up . but like my mother , she remained strong somehow even more strength than she knew she . when i'm watching these episodes , it if i'm receiving motherly advice i watch listen florida advise j.j. , thelma michael . overall , i enjoy watching these old episodes many times i like . thank you esther , may you rest peace	1

superb casting dark , realistic character storyline make this one best crime dramas ever . deniro character really deep inside not want live anymore since life he knew it basically over ( life crime drives him ) . he also love not understand not know how deal it . he makes stupid mistake end letting his emotions cloud his decision making , but it really mistake or death wish disguise ? pacino fulfills his wish . pacino character just driven but opposite direction . two sides same coin , same coin , different face . just deniro cannot let go what killing him neither pacino . it takes deniro life leaves pacino alive but missing best life , thus he also dead , walking dead .	1

far ice vehicles go this one pretty good . ice gives totally believable performance former rap artist desperately trying parlay his past sucess music business into career bad actor . his acting probably improving though , but who tell ? unfortunately science cannot yet measure miniscule improvement his talent amazon not provide me option anything less than one star ... all aside , ice not totally blame this movie garbage-ness . script pretty weak supporting cast not very supportive . maybe i couldn't suspend my disbelief , but certain scenes , like all ones where people stealthy , they not stealthy , they clearly plain view people they sneak up . stealth bomber featured film spends most its time parked garage . when it attacks targets it certainly doesn't quot ; smart bombquot ; them ... nor it make any effort go unseen . it actually attacks broad daylight . i guess we supposed chalk up ice t lack flight experience . bottom line : if you name your movie quot ; stealth fighterquot ; then definition it should some stealth it . maybe its ironic . maybe quality movie quot ; stealthyquot ; making it appear if it without quality . bearing mind i give it no stars but it gets five stars -- all stealth mode	-1

i very impressed this story . i saw it theater , also this version dvd . this one most intense , longest , fulfilling movies available topic pornography industry 70 80 . very stylistic ( un)believable . ( c)ockumentary superior proportions . but it wasn't really documentary , just hollywood movie , based time , when porn coveted raincoat crowd . when i say ( un)believable , i mean story truely unbelievable , porn industry not man actor world , but clearly belongs female actor . she star this industry . so , when i see movie like this , i worry young men out there , who think they next " dirk diggler . " while , i'm probably over worrying concept , i still hope my words reach some man out there . this not reality . this fantasy , conceptualized hollywood director ; nothing more . reality , this could easily story written female actress , such rollergirl ? interesting enough , director fell into cliche , making rollergirl , victim . chastised her highschool classmates , ran out school . but reality , we know , know it jenna jameson tera patrick who real starts . i give this one 5 stars though , it really over top effort director . i quite impressed . two hard ones up ! this movie rocks ! mc white said : check it out !!	1

i finally got view tadpole --- few days after most recent presidential election . film nothing directly politics , but inadvertently it reminds one why democrats crushed last tuesday . aaron stanford aptly portrays fifteen year old oscar grubman , son columbia university historian ( late john ritter ) stepson heart disease researcher ( signourney weaver ) . this liberal elitist family living manhattan . needless add , their nonchalant attitudes toward sexuality , especially pertaining older adults enjoying sex young teenagers considered disgraceful majority citizens living red states . we observe precocious oscar wrestling ( often french ) his existential romantic challenges . eventually he beds woman her forties ( bebe neuwrath ) . this event not reported police . contrary , nobody wishes judgmental . teenage boy supposedly nature enough enter into such relationships . united states indeed split apart cultural war . red blue staters barely able comprehend world view each other . tadpole remind you just how serious differences . this movie ironically important manner which would likely surprise director gary winick . you need see it . this especially true if you wish take peek our national political future .	1

" cubist " wrote exceptional review this one not live up type quality but i put my two meager cents . this first movie i ever saw stephen dorff . i college time immediately identified his character intensity actor . jack nicholson stupendous this role ( usual)and he ignites friction him his stepson , jason ( dorff ) . he on-the-outs wine merchant who debt say least . so order get ahead he , sleezy ex-con played michael caine , steal valuable necklace some rich snobs . dorff unintentially gets caught up mess his stepfather ( nicholson ) created plot thickens . this movie great drama solid performances nicholson , dorff , caine . brilliance these performances they subtle times not try cover over plot itself ( which due well written script really drive this movie well ) . jennifer lopez this one well plays nicholson mistress . her character really just annoyed me some reason i don't know why . perhaps it because i think times , movie itself wanted portray her woman strength i just didn't see it . her character weak lot ways annoyed hell out me . but ultimately , if you want see solid movie flies low under radar , i would recommend this anyone . thanks	1

it took me while get around it but i finally gave it chance . trailers clips made fight club look like film glorifying silly wwe-style backyard brawls . opening credits zoom out ed norton body up pistol held tyler durden ( pitt ) . norton narrates story bring viewer up speed . his character firmly enmeshed dull , desensitized slave toiling claims adjuster , easy , well-paid desk job . he rents high-rise apartment bloated designer furniture , name brand clothes , name brand food ... he addicted comforted male support groups . then , one day , woman ( helena bonham carter ) ups decides sit . chance meeting soap salesman tyler durden ( brad pitt ) prods norton character blow up his safe , materialistic life take residence dump edge town . he tyler ( pitt ) form support group called fight club . therapy sessions include gladiator tournaments designed amp up aggression . participants emerge pulpy but there no losers . they hirelings chumps outside world . brutish matches empower them . groups prior fight club reinforced their weakness , like e.d ( erectile dysfunction . ironically , member this group , steroid abuser , breasts ) . finally they club no woman would join , real men club . fight club stunning ultra-violent open interpretation including society addiction icons . tyler durden ( pitt character ) says : " things you own end up owning you . " solution , he believes , fight give up perfect . bruises , swollen eyes , broken teeth cut lips trophies . aspect movie idol worship . there one scene especially grotesque beautiful illustrating paradox fight club . norton horribly disfigures new recruit . asked why he replied nonchalantly he " wanted destroy something beautiful . " this , me , foretold direction organization towards vandalism . picture slick green hue similar sheen matrix movies , or hard , silver tint james cameron uses . cgi very effective throughout . norton fear exposed chaotic sequence showing his internal physiology . , picture jumps like speaker brad pitt voice . fight club feels like graphic novel -- very surreal fun look . but it not everyone . fincher great job . he could shined it up turned noise down but didn't . i highly recommend it !	1

political/histories student studied rwandan genocide some detail , let me start just saying i impressed relatively historically accurate depictions various parties genocide(french , belgian , u.s. , u.n. , interahamwe , tutsi positions ) chronoglical events take place during movie itself . nick nolte portrayal u.n. colonel shackled bureaucracy politics ( instigated belgians who among few willing join u.n. mission but 10 peacekeepers murderered initial days genocide others withdrew support due domestic public opinion ) strikingly realistic appears draw obvious connections actions romeo dallaire who held similar post during u . . ' limited mandate rwanda events began unfold . unlike many contemporary movies which draw upon label " based true story " feature many embellishments , movie remains remarkably free dramatic flourishes or moral sermonising . person , i found it difficult not moved vivid portrayal horrors became known among worst atrocities human history ; 1 million killed less than 3 months - faster rate killing death than holocaust . indictment human indifference plight others , movie stands testament not just human suffering continues draw its historical roots european colonialism ( german belgian this instance ) but also remarkable stories survival which emerged subsequent killings . don cheadle unforgettable hotel manager who genocide brought into his home , work family chooses respond plight others around him ( hutu tutsi alike ); risking everything protect powerless voiceless . soundtrack equally brilliant ; incorporating african influences intermeshing perfectly into various scenes ( million voices ) . truly memorable touching , hotel rwanda provides insight into traditional contemporary attitude west towards africans . this perfectly captured two particular statements : one jack ( joaquin phoenix ) other colonel oliver ( nick nolte ) . it also triumphs role individual ; actions even one man help change world around him . never again	1

let me start saying first movie series absolutely fantastic . regardless fact it didn't stick few key plotlines book , everyone still great job adapting original jurassic park . then came this piece trash ... whereas first movie least attempted loosely base itself book , this one just takes brilliant writing michael chrichton throws it directly out window . first off , john hammond supposed dead . he dies end first novel . secondly ian malcome supposedly dead , or least mia end first book , we join him costarican hospital opening 2nd . there no bratty daughter , entire premise much more it . most importantly ... entire ending san diego t-rex ... which possibly worst conceived plot line history movies ... not exist book ! i went into this movie expecting tightly woven plot , huge concentration conspiracy such island exist , anticipation some good dino-scenes top it off . what i ended up getting writing equivalent monkey typewriter drooling page . not only ... but because lack plot , dino scenes complete over-kill . when you see so much it , you lose awe wonder first film . when you see brachiosaur first 20 mins original film , wonderment difficult rival . there no such moments this film . if you're looking quick fix decent looking dino fx , go nuts . however , if you're looking something more substantial actual plotline , flick off dvd player pick up book . oh one more thing ... don't go near 3rd movie . they didn't even book untrue . i can't imagine how much more long-winded rambling my review would one	-1
" finding neverland " easily one my top twenty favorite films all time , my top ten favorite films 2004 . story " finding neverland " inspired life author/playwright james . barrie who played talented johnny depp . while i wasn't convinced his scottish accent , johnny makes up it moving performance child trapped man body . stuck loveless marriage trying recover failed play , james barrie meets widow sylvia llewelyn davies ( played lovely kate winslet ) her four boys immediately strikes up genuine platonic friendship widow her boys . james ' friendship davies brothers quickly inspire him create what would eventually evolve into story peter pan . there few changes made james . barrie story but this film never claimed actual documentary or docudrama barrie life . aside , " finding neverland " truly moving film . gorgeous orchestral film score jan a.p kaczmarek helped film emotional impact especially last fifteen minutes film . all actors involved film gave wonderful performances especially kate winslet freddie highmore . dvd some excellent bonus features like outtakes which hilarious behind scene footage . after almost two years since it released , i still love watching " finding neverland " . i still get verklempt whenever i see ending which actually makes me shed tear or two	1

first , we need little truth-in-advertising here : these dvds not uncensored . " mostly uncensored " would more like it . fact , there one scene where racial " " word visually censored while same time its verbal use not . while this explained away limitation production process , it just odd makes you wonder if scene wouldn't worked better if it censored altogether . additionally , some first episodes this season almost seemed written or improvised around fact cast knew their speech not going censored , so they set throwing expletives around dizzying display adolescent-like freedom . use profanity not offensive itself , but sophomoric atmosphere it creates way below talents these gifted comic actors . taken whole , this second season downplays its parody cops which writers successfully delivered us season one . it still there , sure , but here we find ourselves more entrenched familiar arena sketch comedy . it takes ball awhile get truly rolling , first i beginning feel disappointed think i going disappointed time i got season end . but , fear not , because especially thanks efforts bad-guy minor characters , lieutenant dangle crew definitely leave us laughing . season ending double-episode works just well any other sitcom-classic season end , it we treated cameo appearances martin mull , wayne brady some missing minor characters season one we witness comedic display who " meet new boss , same old boss . " all all , just season one , these people who just fun . these season two disks highly recommended all students comedy , well others who just need good laugh . niecy nash charm thomas lennon gum-chewing , dead-pan delivery worth price admission all themselves . if you ever go " traffic school " because you've received traffic ticket , i'll bet you " stick time " you'll never class like ones administered deputies reno911 . season one , there no laugh track , bonus material commentary thrown well	1

" winnie pooh abc " original winnie pooh story designed teach rhyming , words letters . rather than straight , rote learning , this presented form half-hour adventure . things all get started when christopher robin introduces pooh book rhymes characters hundred acre woods . christopher robin lets pooh borrow book soon pooh all his friends learning rhymes , words , reading alphabet , some help wise old owl . one major complaints this movie seems it only introduces few letters . if this concern you or your child , then i recommend making sure you get dvd version not video . it wonderful special feature goes through alphabet thoroughly , characters teach each letter both upper lower-case associated words . adults probably get bored this pretty quickly , but it'll dead useful your kid(s ) . there also abc song scenes " new adventures winnie pooh " that quite worthwhile . overall , if you want your kids learn alphabet , or just wanna see good pooh story , i'd say you can't go wrong this , especially if you get dvd version . also included dvd version fast-play option previews movies such " mulan ii " " pooh heffalump movie , " well original trailer both this 123s video / dvd . there anything else i wanted say ? oh , bother . think , think , think ..	1

since " ringu " japanese horror movies all rage here us , but mind you , not all them actually any good , what works japanese audiences not necessarily translate well american moviegoers . reason hollywood studios occasionally remake japanese horror hits give them western feel , case " ring . " same happened " grudge , " movie whose original played very well japan . unlike " ring " which hwas completely westernized , " grudge " columbia pictures took more restrained route . hiring same director who created original film , leaving its location tokyo cast consisting mostly japanese actors , filmmakers added only few hollywood actors create american feel . i curious find out if they succeeded well " ring " . i found " grudge " thoroughly enjoyable tense film hat kept me edge throughout . sinister undertones film , sound effects , strong visuals course stingers , all make first rate horror film , much better than most hollywood fare recent years , though you open somewhat different eastern sensibilities film plays upon .	1
well i just finished book christine last week . i determined find movie . after searching last week , i finally bout it . i seen it few years ago when i 10 or 11 . somehow i remember it much better . but nonetheless , it great . i few problems though . generally i dont mind things rearranged or changed , but they cut out wayyy too much , completly changed ending . they practically swtiched roland lebays role george lebays role , but only partically , i quite confused when i got scene . they also completely cut out lebay possession sub-plot , thus changing arnies character . i dissapointed micheal cunninghams role this movie , first off , he didnt look like thing like i pictured him , his whole sub-plot arnie dennis completely cut , he only 10 lines entire movie . biggest dissapointment me cutting dennis/leigh subplot . ending changed totally , also disappointment . however , i like rearranging certain things , it helps flow movie much better , actors arnie dennis perfect , too bad dennis role minimized much it . effects amazing ! even now , i cant imagine them any better , this if way back 83 . music wonderful perfectly fitting , regina cunningham just i imagined her , her role isnt cut down too much though . overall , i stil recommened movie , one better movies based stephen king novel , i only say read novel first . btw , their 20 deleted scenes i am go check out right now , therefore , their should good chunck missing footage it	1
it 1961 ; ussr finally finished its nuclear powered submarine ready deploy it off east coast united states purpose ... brinksmanship ? but hold , there problem ; soviet union staffed incompetents !! (one communism most odious flaws it not inspire common man excel ) . menacing black submarine doomed get-go . it leaks , it cobbled together substandard parts . after heading out sea , there problem nuclear reactor several men must go repairs wearing only chemical suits because warehouse out radiation suits . men receive lethal doses radiation , but unfortunately doctor doesn't know anything radiation sickness ... he only giving them aspirin . before long radiation begins permeate ship . entire crew danger . officers two minds - some want save crew expense letting submarine fall into hands americans , while others want save face soviet union even if it means lot men fall sick or die . submarine becomes more more disabled , men stumble reactor room vomitting shaking , commanding officer repeatedly refuses help nearby american destroyer , submarines food supply deemed too contaminated eat , dread crew really palpable . this movie very suspenseful because i no idea how it would end . definitely worth your time	1

i knew i trouble four brothers when i saw josh howard ( sports night fame ) scowling hard , trying tough detroit cop . not believable nanosecond . then it got worse when marky mark said , " why don't you two cops get some doughnuts coffee ? " rest film veers kind lame clich�d rhythm . almost every scene this thing howler . watching it , i remembered i hadn't forgiven tyrese gibson travesty 2 fast 2 furious . still , tyrese better than garrett hedlund , who looks like he refugee outsiders . but movie not total wash ; after all , it got great soundtrack	-1

if you loved back future trilogy , generally speaking , time traveling extravaganzas silver screen ... simply forget buying this dvd . all well it would make you feel like total idiot first half movie , while you try figure out all " time-traveling science " you've taught so far , then space you out close end , leaving you totally speechless . this not good , simply because producers writers probably went crazy themselves trying emulate real time-traveling pros , while winding up some abrubt , nonsense end movie , absolutely no sci-fi logic all : they simply eventually stop shooting , so they just thought any happy ending would trick , no matter time differences numberless loose ends still untied plot . not sci-fi movie not romantic story either : look elsewhere any these two types movie	-1
i never bought vhs tape , but when i notified this would coming out dvd , i ordered it . while i'm not amateur , i am professional , eric guitarist guitarist . anyone who thinks he don't need learnin ' fool only famous his own little world , small it may . i'm not arrogant . danny gatton known humbler , eric johnson could rightly called inspiration . what he not so much difficult it epitome finesse transparency technique . after viewing this , you understand what i mean . i already know much what eric teaches this session , what it , private session ( much like you might get git ) , master top his craft . but there always something learn even after repeated viewings . i even scanned booklet comes this so i break lessons down blow up individual charts more easy reading . if you serious improving player , if you're looking real professional , you need get this , if only see what true professionalism looks sounds like . lessons clear focused . booklet new ability slow down examples , you really learn play these things . but don't expect sound like eric ( just those who tried , but could never sound like jimi hendrix ) . you different so always sound different , that plus . but techniques all included here part " must learn " program you need create follow if you want least make good living playing music . learn master melody technique , where technique doesn't get way melody , but lives service song -- way it should . i teach , too . i recommend any student who wants grow they should get this dvd . if you get no other , this would serve whatever style you choose pursue , ultimately , because there so much here applied virtually any style , whether it jazz , country , blues , rock or even acoustic ( which i wish he would included segment , my only kvetch )	1

i bought this dvd my third-grade twins who difficulty memorizing math facts , don't quite understand relation these math facts real world . i thought this dvd would perfect , explaining basic math facts humor real life examples . but their explanations way over heads this age group . explaining concept " carrying over " while adding , instance , here what said written out screen : " carrying over means you take digit tensplace digit place sum , carry over digit next digit place left your addition problem . you this whenever sum amount digit place greater than nine .

i , like others who wrote before me , am thrilled finally see diagnosis murder dvd . please put other seasons dvd soon possible !!!! it one best shows ever developed . think it --- dick van dyke creators geniuses their day . they pre-cursors all csi shows others like it . they forensics solved murders , but much less gruesome way . diagnosis murder g-rated show solves crimes thought provoking way , without showing all blood guts all csi other shows . you actually sleep after watching show . dick van dyke cast like huge family ( no pun intended since his son barry lead role ) camaraderie comes through make very enjoyable family friendly show . young old , cool nerdy , single or married , people all walks life enjoy this wonderful show . amazon , if you could pass all positive feedback producers , so they see how much people desperately want other seasons dvd , i think i speak all fans show when i say , " we'd greatly appreciate it ! " readers , buy this dvd you won't disappointed . show awesome	1
" munich " not one steven spielberg best films , but it still worth watching due mainly brilliant cast . eric bana , geoffrey rush , daniel craig especially outstanding . film also impressive physical production haunting john williams score . but there problems . one thing , it too long . seems problem many directors today . why all today big movies run nearly three hours ? spielberg could cut half hour , film would much better . but biggest problem spielberg , kushner , roth really stacked deck israel here . story entirely one-sided . there excellent scene where araband israeli agents confront each other , three filmmakers would wise pursue angle . instead , no explanation given arabs'side or why they seized athletes first place . result decidedly unbalalnced story . ending ambiguous . still , " munich " ambitious film worth watching	1

not only this arguably best docudrama ever made , it damn fun watch , george . scott brings legendery commander european theater operations life mesmerizing performance . fact , i think it pretty hard imagine patton without scott bearing , he quickly became synonymous role , even though he turned down oscar equally legendary declining speech given american indian woman 1970 academy awards . film doesn't so much chart patton life it make him captivating symbol american hubris . old blood guts considered many america greatest war hero , schaffner puts patton grand stage . we see patton his most combative , his powerful oratory skills which many ways voiced american foreign policy , even political leaders soft pedaled it . while movie definitely not political tract , it these undercurrents well worth watching again , especially time when we see so much bluster harsh rhetoric coming out white house . dvd package may not meet some persons high definition standards , but movie digital enhanced there plenty extras . you won't disappointed	1
i cannot believe how many negative reviews this film actually received . they watching same movie i watching ? i generally concider myself very critical when it comes political thrillers such " sentinel " , so i am not going just generally give such movie one my favorite genres high rating automatically without giving it some fore-thought . " sentinel " everything intense , well-crafted political thriller should . acting quite convincing suspense riveting . i guarantee you pinned edge your seat through entire film then some . also , scenario extremely plausible , especially today world , all militant groups out there -- neo-nazis islamic radicals -- who would stop nothing make assination attempt or terrorist attack against president or some u.s. institution . my advice , before listening negative rants other reviewers this film , go ahead take look it yourself . it safe bet you not disappointed .	1

many say books always far better then movies . i agree this . i read whole entire series ; anne green gables rilla ingleside . i devoured every single one , enjoyed all characters sad when i finished reading them . but i say movie very , very good ! megan follows superb job portraying anne , jonathan crombie so good gilbert . every single actor beautiful job made their personalities come alive . i heard myself say , " they shouldnt made movie book , they ruined everything doing so . " but when i watch anne green gables , i say this differen t.t hey only brought more story different way . anne avonlea continuation story , i loved one just much . i say though , anne green gables continuing story disapointed me very much . they changed plot , characters still what you loved but joy you usually felt when you watched first two isn't felt when you watch this one . it so different book it made me mad . part i like it though , when anne gilbert get married , its bittersweet yet lovely part movie . end when anne finally finds gilbert , its beautiful moment too . so my opinion this : buy anne green gables , anne avonlea , story told beautiful way . but only rent anne green gables continuing story , don't buy it	1

manchurian candidate sluggish remake updating 1962 classic starring frank sinatra . this film case study why some movies should never redone . this film takes globalized issues reduces them personal jealousies . afraid assert viewpoint , script meanders . denzel washington plays sinatra role ben markoe . he seems dazed camera though he struggling remember his lines . washington , normally gifted actor , plays part without any conviction whatsoever uncharacteristically brings zero charisma role . markoe discovers his gulf war comrade-in-arms , raymond shaw , soon next vice-president united states , subject mind control experimentation manchurian global , vast multinational conglomerate . raymond handler his senator mother ( meryl streep role ice queen ) . diluting threat communism capitalism , producers lose sight most powerful elements story . after all , it no great achievement convince major american political candidate back big business , so grotesqueries shaw brainwashing get lost against backdrop , seeming less heinous than merely greedy , even when shaw becomes programmed murderer hands his avaricious , amoral , possibly incestuous mother . why film created unlikely manchurian global corporation demon day shied away any real political controversy indicative manchurian global mindset gripped hollywood . god forbid we should point finger mainland china ( or anyplace else ); it might reduce bottom line . this film says more its creators than threat it attempts portray . yourself huge favor stick original .	1

i heard it said norman maclean classic novella " river runs through it " finest piece american literature ever written . i don't understand how things like literature ranked such simple terms . i say , however , it one my personal favorites . spare , poetic spellbinding . perhaps one reasons i love this novella so because i grew up farm near rocky mountains , spent so much time when i younger fishing tracking through wood field . maclean tale speaks me my youth authentic familiar terms . i generally approach cinematic adaptations literature , particularly literature which i hold such high esteem , certain amount reluctance , even dread . who could possibly capture beautiful , simple craftmanship maclean profound prose celluloid ? evidently , robert redford . he it grace apparent ease . many maclean efficeintly magnificent words provided through narration . while i generally find device voiceover narration distasteful ( primarily because it so often used " coach " viewer ) , this case , viewer drawn into ( eased out ) macleans world macleans own prose , nothing could more appropriate or satisfying . also , cinematography nothing short spectacular , capturing magnificent , rugged expanse montana " big sky " wilderness one moment , golden intimacy afternoon river next . i dare say redford captured essence maclean abiding love his childhood wilderness this film , we , viewers , richer it . river runs through it close perfection i seen translating beloved work letters onto cinematic screen . it its flaws ? i'm sure it , there other reviews here point them out you if you care . my part , i wish only say this story love , crafted maclean love , now adapted screen redford care speaks love - love subject matter written words . macleans last words novella ( movie ) " i am haunted waters . " thanks his words , redfords faithful adaptation them , i too am haunted	1

" charlie chaplin marathon " inexpensive way seeing variety silent comedies chaplin . it includes versions trio chaplin two-reelers down mutual , including what arguably best this shorts , film distinction first attempt full-length comedy ( albeit not chaplin ): " rink " ( released december 4 , 1916 ) , eighth mutual comedy , based karno company sketch called " skating " written charlie brother , syd chaplin . chaplin often inspired business serving food here he ends up waiter who ends up rollers kating rink trying keep upright . course , if you already seen " modern times " you know chaplin virtuoso wheels when it comes roller skating . this time around edna purviance girl , while eric campell one her admirers , mr. stout , henry bergman plays both mrs. stout angry diner ( you imagine what charlie make diner angry ) . terms slapstick , " rink " most creative mutual two-reelers . " immigrant " ( released june 17 , 1917 ) best chaplin shorts far i am concerned . chaplin filmed 24 hours footage over two months produce 21-minute film when most two-reelers shot two days . when chaplin began , filming restaurant scene ( campbell head waiter ) , film going bohemian life , but scene too short he decided make tramp young girl immigrants , creating opening sequence boat happy ending . starting simple gag tramp leaning over ship railing turning out something other than what we think , " immigrant " classic chaplin , mixing comedy , romance , pathos . " tillie punctured romance " ( released november 14 , 1914 ) notable film not because presence chaplin , who essentially out character playing heartless sharper instead loveable tramp , but it product max sennet desire produce first feature-length comedy film history . sennett signed famous stage comedienne marie dressler film version her big success , " tillie nightmare . " massive legal entanglement resulted film sold arco $ 100,000 released " tillie punctured romance " whole bunch different lengths different soundtracks . essentially this burlesque burlesque which city slicker ( chaplin ) leads pretty country heiress ( dressler ) astray . sennett throws every trick he knows into directing this 1914 film anyone familiar work chaplin or dressler after this point dismayed their performances here . chaplin extremely deadpan dressler overly mannered ( way too much makeup ) . fortunately even his facial hair different enough us convince ourselves this not tramp therefore not real chaplin . " vagabond " ( released july 10 , 1916 ) , third two-reeler mutual , chaplin street violinist who starts off passing hat some other street musicians but takes donations goes country . there he rescues girl ( purviance ) who kidnapped band gypsies . they meet artist ( lloyd bacon ) who paints girl portrait . girl falls love artist his painting seen girl real mother . campbell plays gypsy chieftain leo white both old jew gypsy woman . this average chaplin comedy slightly lower level than other two mutuals included this dvd	1

these short films starring w.c. fields , their own right , classic comedies . uneven , some pointed out , but classic their own right . i believe problem some people fields ' sense humor it too dark and/or too adult them . fields spokesman common man , especially during depression . his comedy subversive sneaky . his complaining voice recognized voice ordinary guy under thumb everyone everything his wife mother-in-law , dogs children , rulers land very business he . kid i not " get " fields all . i didn't understand what he doing , i didn't think he funny . i much preferred laurel hardy ( whom i still adore ) charlie chase whose humor more obvious accessible me . i annoyed fields ' whining complaining , didn't get sarcastic asides , just not like him all . i grew older i began understand what it fields doing . he original , pioneer . late sam kinnison larry david seinfeld , there isn't comic writer or performer who doesn't owe something w.c. fields . all bitching moaning you hear , especially stand-ups , nothing more than fields brought into modern era . he ( mark twain before him ) spawned sly sarcastic wit american comic dialogue long before it commonly accepted or widely appreciated . make no mistake : fields ' humor masks real pain . what we hear his whiny voice suffering man who can't catch break save himself . he championing all losers , little guys , nobodies , if it sounds bitter times , well ... it . i agree some other reviewers here when they say one must grow up go through certain amount real-life experiences before fields truly grasped ultimately - if you're lucky - embraced . otherwise you better off three stooges marx brothers . their worlds completely unreal whereas fields ' world all too real . it place escape * * not into , what you hear fields ' beaten-down characters sound man dragged through knothole backwards . ekw	1

aaron russo very brave man his production this outspoken film . he should commended his efforts regardless some minor inaccuracies , such , " there no law .

this great movie . several reasons some guys questioning fact this movie too bloody . but here it noble purpose . ( this not sin city or reservoir dogs ) read gospels . our saviour didn't come here pleasure , or chatting herod , drink some wine , wonderful feasts marry beautiful girl ( some fools say he married mary magdalene)and eternally happy hollywood wants us believe . no . he came here redeem us . he came here show us how christian should face suffering above this , he came here show us real face father , our father love . seeing this movie seeing how much jesus loves us . meditation passion christ devotion devotions . lot conversions occurred after people started meditating these sufferings our lord . all saints meditated them profound devotion them . even more , they recommended this devotion order obtain real sanctity life , because real love ( only somebody willing suffer like this die you , really loves you ! ) attracts lovers . regarding accusations " antisemitism " , i just one recommendation . it not secret jews hate jesus his church . this movie only describes what really happened according gospels . sympathetic sanhedrin would lie . they wanted jesus dead that what mel shows us this movie . what wrong ??? but if you're christian you'll understand devil who doesn't want people watch this movie because jesus ' victory against him cross . buy this movie !!!!	1

since george clooney his rat pack seem bringing back certain cachet italy lake como , it worth revisiting this picture-postcard pretty 1995 romantic comedy directed john irvin since it set there before onset wwii . lightweight plot focuses beautiful , elegant villa summer 1937 where miss bentley already spent sixteen summers her father . adored staff , she spends her first summer there after her father died , her first day , she immediately drawn polite but rather pompous major wilshaw . typical movie-only fashion , they meet repeatedly , awkwardly fractiously , particular , over tennis match where she defeats major ease front most enthusiastic group . there unavoidable but unspoken chemistry two , but further complications ensue arrival miss beaumont , young , flirtatious nanny wealthy italian family staying villa . miss beaumont manages convince wilshaw she loves him , he becomes instantly enamored . her side , miss bentley attracts attention much younger admirer named vittorio , local vespa-riding lothario intent seducing her amid his raging hormones . you imagine , complications sort themselves out , but clever way irvin screenwriter trevor bentham handle story , while patently old-fashioned , also charming sometimes quite perceptive how more mature people approach love . rare comedic turn immediately recalls kate hepburn circa 1955 " summertime " , vanessa redgrave redefines any preconceived image one would spinster , she brings buoyant energy blessed lack self-consciousness independent miss bentley . even though she makes no attempt assimilating into period her most contemporary look , she shows off deft skill romantic foreplay likely first time since she mod swinger 1960 movies like " morgan !

this second season mission : impossible we see peter gravesintroduced head impossible missions force , roleof jim phelps , replacing steven hill dan briggs . dan briggscharacter more cerebral , jim phelps character more physical . both characters their supporters , although i tend preferjim phelps . it noteworthy i don't believe there anyother television series could replace its lead actor nothave it affect shows quality or popularity . this becausemi " plot driven " rather than " character driven " . indeed , two morecentral characters would leave after season 3 ( rollin cinammon ) andyet series would go several more seasons , indicatingthe outstanding quality plots , direction production . general , i feel overall quality series improved thesecond third seasons . there episodes first season thatare good any ever produced ( e.g. operation rogosz , carriers , frame well pilot episode ) , but there good numberof weaker stories . second season sees overall stronger effort . whereas first season still some 1960's-staple car chases , shootouts fist fights , these pretty much disappear second season emphasis outwitting enemy clever plots ingenious gadgets . especially noteworthy " trial fury " which especially intensestory , masterfully directed leonard horn who also equally intense " operationrogosz " , " photographer " great performance anthony zerbe who plays son convicted atomic scientist out revenge , unusual episode called " town " where jim drugged held prisonerby evil enemy agent played otherwise grandfatherly geer . seeing masterpiece television series like this made 40 years ago only make us lament dismal state art today	1

effective ghost story should air mystery it : why there ghost ? what purpose ghost haunting particular place or person ? modicum pathos also important truly emotional turn screw , ghost cannot only vindictive or vengeful , but must sadness it ; something we empathize make haunting all more tragic , well spooky . gore also must kept minimum , effective ghost story relies creating sustaining balanced mood tension . too much gore balance shifts into rapid moments revulsion anxiety , whereas good ghost story relies impression subtlety , implying more than actually shown . whispering corridors ghost story expertly balances social commentary regarding south korean girls ' school ( why ) , pathos duality ghost it moves normalcy ( daylight ) vengeance spirit ( night ) , symbolic use blood tell moving tale loss , redemption , continued loss . it opens our ghost prowling girl school grounds dark stormy night ( i know , but it dark stormy ) , ready exact vengeance teacher mistreated her . teacher discovered ghost secret , thus seals her fate . discovery murdered teacher cinematic style ; first showing face student she reacts seeing mrs. parks ' hanging body walkway , then showing back student she views body , her head blocking our view , finally , camera ' steps ' left student , show hanging body farground , back student foreground , side side . other student reactions then shown still shots they come upon body . muted colors throughout film lend stark , rather cold aspect events unfold girl school , putting more emphasis callous indifference mistreatment students their emotional needs . male teachers school come off chauvinistic condenscending all-girl classroom , become violent toward students little provocation . one teacher particular , mr. oh ( mad dog , students call him ) , his stick sarcastic unstable temperament , reminded me math teacher i suffered through one semester . he also carried stick whacked students little provocation . learning intimidation threat , whether south korean all-girls school , or north american all-boys school , not conducive true learning environment . it this restrictive , competitive , uncreative classroom environment our ghost born haunts day night ; day , one students attended class years without any teacher noticing her , night , vengeance spirit , murdering those teachers mistreated her any other girl . pathos brought into story ghost need normal , relive her classroom life again again hopes getting it right . she not want hurt anyone , but those annoyingly vindictive sadistic teachers keep mistreating students , thus bring vengeance spirit night , exact revenge . while vengeance ghost appears only three times film , each occurrence filled supernatural events build into violent attack bloodily carried out , but not gorily so . blood used symbolically here , not shock value , especially end , when classroom becomes inundated blood ghost finds release stops her haunting . i should point out there sequelization-antic ( aka ' not over yet folks ' ) used end film , but this case , it fits perfectly within logic story , serves heighten tragedy film social commentary focusing : how south korean girls school system repressive , demoralizing , , some , downright fatal . how sad this commentary also said our own school system	1

recent films covering lives and/or careers artists , basquiat among best . while spanning less than 10 years life this musician cum artists cum celebrity , it all one needs comprehend how this prodigy became overwhelmed fame fortune . juxtaposed against warhol , who profoundly understood dimensions celebrity , we see basquiat quite opposite -- naive point charming , overwhelmed times , utimately seduced all nefarious world which booze , drugs , sex all there taking . but this all seen before lives people such belushi , joplin , hendrix , slew others ; so much early death young star seems become almost archetype . yet it still intrigues us multiple reasons , , pointed out early movie , death artist seem mystify both work person . would basquiat nearly famous now , he cleaned up continued painting ? we might guess if case there would probably not movie him . this serves illuminate other burning questions indirectly offered film : basquiat really good artist , or he right place right time when new york art market eighties bullish way probably never seen again ? , schnabel canonizing basquiat into league mythical artist ? whatever answers may , i honestly say my interest thoroghly piqued , so i equally curious basquiat i his place time . perhaps it schnabel artist shines through much film , moreso than schabel writer/director . basquiat movie replete symbolism , both overt covert . give example each , narrative film enhanced several occasions sub-narrative surfing -- hopefully all you need know . otherwise , direction cinematography seems follow basquiat life career , where choppy editing eccentric montage play almost sub-character . it should noted many characters movie fact compounds various people throughout his life during this time . course , andy andy , rene rene , largely , his art dealers his dealers , but beyond his friends girlfriends movie generally cover multiple personages . end , tale basquiat tragic but compelling , it movie deserves multiple viewings , especially those interested art world , or who like good bio-pic . some fiction , some fact , but otherwise contextually acurate	1
i'm fan reality television even though contestants survivor big brother completely artificial situation , far reality . yet nobody writing their script ; they writing themselves . these comments also relevant this excellent documentary young bob dylan tour england 1965 . i don't like spotlight reviews this site . they too " expert " don't get everything right . they too full themselves . one main impressions i get this documentary concerns clash beautiful brilliant dylan , who actually doing something good world , reporters/critics . true , dylan very confrontational them , but they lucky his attention all . it seems like these nothings , these cogs wheels employ them , don't get point all . point hattie carroll , murdered rich apathetic white s.o.b. getting away it . point bob dylan coming out saying something needs said . point bob dylan believes right wrong , therefore mouthpiece god , cutting through all our crap . very few others doing this time . not too many doing it now either . put radio . what you hear ? you hear personal lyrics , i love you , i find you attractive , i'm mad you , whatever . one genre you hear you worthless except degree you turn me , singer worth more than you because he fancier car more expensive jewelry , blow you away shotgun . what bunch baloney . what kind values we offering young people who listen this idiocy think it cool ? then you dylan . justice . poetry . intelligence . how often you hear lyric radio intelligent ? contrast dylan this documentary some more recent dylans . you know song union sundown ? that one ripping globalization shreds , decade before everyone else realized it needed stopped , way maximize profits paying pennies labor , firing american workers replacing them slave labor overseas . contrast dylan this younger one . more modern one , older one , isn't physically beautiful anymore , isn't pixyish darling anymore , but he just target , just sharp penetrating . one highlights this video live performance beginning it all over now baby blue special request donovan . first , donovan sings perfectly nice song , then dylan sings freaking masterpiece . i like way dylan smiles he sings " yonder stands your orphan " . think line . your orphan ? means you dead , doesn't it . i like dylan smile he sings line , smile saying hey , listen lyric , get it ? it one really interesting lines it all over now , baby blue . albert hall , dylan alone his guitar harmonica , no band behind him , he mesmerizing world most elite audience , beatles among them . he doing it just himself , his brilliant self . i like most commentary . this one few videos where i played film second time listen whole commentary . it funny way one commentators gives all his reasons pleased hattie carroll cut off before its climactic ending thunderous applause , then other commentator , who obviously right , completely disagrees what we've listening , perfectly non-confrontational way , says one song should shown its entirety . far detracting effectiveness film , this song would made entire point film , dylan powerhouse . real people , worth watchin	1

this really fun movie . funny , too , but also fun . i great time watching this , unlike many other drama / comedies , every point where it could easily become tear-jerker , writers broke it up some comedy . they pull it off well , entire movie comes together very smoothly . addition great story , chemistry jolie pitt absolutely evident ~ perfect way add fire already great story . if you like love stories but frequently find them too sappy , or if you like action flicks but frequently get bored gratuitous violence , you'll probably like this movie , which strikes nice balance both . i highly recommend it	1

this film should it all , it story great show woman , close friends greatest show men , noel coward . it large budget , potentially great leading lady , great costumes whole plethero original lawrence stage numbers , " poor jenny " particularly striking . but somehow none enough either utilise andrews her full potential nor tell story gertrude lawrence right amount truth razzmatazz . andrews largely blamed it failure time but this seems so wrong , essentially it problem script , gertie struggle alcohol only hinted . coward homosexuality completely glossed over gertie illness subsequent death 50 , cancer , not even eluded ! here lies problem i feel , how earth you set screen alight story sensational life if you only tell bits story you think audience tolerate ? you need let audience judge what they take they clearly hated this ! shame wasted opportunity	1

here one word sums up this film : beauty . plot " house flying daggers " ( original title : " shi mian mai fu " ) lacking , but way it made up intoxicating sets , costumes , exquisite love story . zhang yimou backs away grandeur " hero " favor more intimate story . it 859 a.d. , near end corrupt tang dynasty . guerilla rebellion called house flying daggers ( who able throw knives great distances ) sprung up against government . despite loss their leader , rebels thriving . deputy jin ( takeshi kaneshiro ) decides go undercover infiltrate house , he tries get trust blind courtesan mei ( zhang ziyi ) , daughter house dead leader . but soon he begins fall love mei , jeopardizing his loyalties , while mei herself experiencing confusion . but government officials want mei dead because her sympathies -- even worse , they don't realize jin undercover . make things worse , jin not only rival mei love -- his best friend well . director zhang yimou apparently said " hero " warm-up " house flying daggers . " it seem more polished fully realized , without " rashomon " storytelling . instead war movie , it mixture fairy-tale romance beauty , spies guerilla warfare . final half-hour stumbling block , where some plot threads come unravelled . things get pretty confusing . zhang doesn't drop ball far stylism goes -- color exquisite details every frame . they almost intoxicating effect , so action sequences . one most memorable scenes ziyi performing " echo game , " where she strikes drums particular rhythm her flowing clothing . not mention balletic , dreamlike fight bamboo forest , participants soaring dipping like cirque de soleil dancers . it all completely unreal , but there lies its beauty , like painting sky focuses sun not clouds . this entirely zhang ziyi picture -- since her debut " road home , " ziyi proved herself wonderful actress . " house flying daggers " focuses mostly ziyi , she gives truly exquisite performance , particularly when she pretends blind woman -- watch her face . two supporting actors , andy lau takeshi kaneshiro , solid job their roles , particularly kaneshiro , who brings plenty life what could cliched bad-cop-turned-lover . " house flying daggers " worth seeing just see -- it visual ecstacy packed around fairly typical love triangle plot slightly disappointing final half hour . but sights alone this intimate love story exquisite	1

this adaptation fairy tale " little red riding hood " not children.it got couple good transformations , not best i've seen but good nonetheless . i'd imagine kids would find this scary it not bad adults either . i doubt this film would made these days 80 able get away much more , unless great terry gilliam helm . i loved set designs , all little creatures way wolves used all very well done.as i said , not something i would show my 8 year old daughter fear it causing her nightmares but would definitely recommend this teens adults . good horror film those who don't need axe-wielding murderers able enjoy more fantasy right	1

this film loosely based upon robert ludlum book " bourne identity " . it not faithful adaptation nor it intended . book just springboard something little different . read book loved it , i also really enjoyed this movie . they both excellent . each forges its own path entertains its own way . plot simple , or so it seems . man found ocean two bullets his back . he rescued trawler italian fishermen . when he regains total consciousness , he no idea who he or what he doing caused him floating ocean condition which he . he shortly discovers his name jason bourne , it appears great many people trying kill him , though what purpose he no idea . jason bourne ( matt damon ) also discovers he some unusual gifts automatic , instinctive responses certain situations . it turns out he natural " bourne " killer ( pun intended ) . jason teams up german expatriate named maria ( franka potente ) , together they run into some heavy duty action , they run their lives . meanwhile , team cia trained assassins , dispatched bourne boss , cia honcho named conklin ( chris cooper ) , hot plucky couple trail . there number stunts action scenes guaranteed make one palms start sweat . matt damon , looking very buff , portrays bourne intelligent , resourceful character core goodness imbedded his assassin psyche . he simply terrific . franka potente good free spirited maria , who also resourceful jason love interest film , though , quite frankly , very few sparks fly them . chris cooper excellent bourne boss , conklin . he coldly efficient brutal his mop-up operation . unlike bourne , he lacks core goodness . this action packed , inventive , spy thriller hold viewer its thrall . this film revives genre film beginning get little stale . kudos damon giving viewer something fresh entertaining this genre . this film well worth one personal collection	1

i enjoyed agatha christie novels dvd - they restore television its primary mission : entertainment . this twisting plot no exception ! land irag , filled sun science archeology , expedition runs into trouble when murder rears its head . fortunately , indomitable poirot scene ! he unravels deep complexities murder(s ) , entangling alliances , takes axe root bitterness jealousy . all all , story thoroughly entertaining mystery unfolds marvelous way . like following breadcrumbs expected end , director leads us inexorably , but logically , conclusion . so , put fire , micro popcorn , sit back relax enjoy pure entertainment .... again	1

epic telling epic historical events . feel extent roman slavery given scenes mines gladiatorial training centers horizon filled crosses end . one great themes this film integrity bravery some " lowliest " slaves reminding us it these qualities make us human not our station life . readiness rebels end stand up counted leader culmination theme ; ending scene still brings chills every time i see it . even such moving serious themes , however , film sprinkled places humor wit , especially slave-trader character mr. ustinov . deleted scenes , such one tony curtis bathhouse , build what only hinted original release making widespread treatment such slaves more apparent . some ways , i think i prefer hint rather than more direct portrayal but it still tasteful manner convey types abuse brought rebellion . gladiator fights battle scenes still some best ever made . i still enjoy them even more than more recent movie similar genre , " gladiator .

entertaining double creature -- er , , double feature inspired tv tales crypt ( which itself inspired identically titled , delightfully decadent ec comics 1950s ) . first bill demon knight ( 1995 ) . surface , this one typical tale good-versus-evil , noble agent heaven working protect mankind evil demon who , help his minions , seeks throw veil darkness over universe oppress mankind process . trite , yes , but good script , talented cast ( including billy zane wonderfully smarmy demon ) , high production values raise this one notch or two above average morality play . weakest element film crypt-keeper wraparound , which too much tv show cheesy feel ( though it feature uncredited cameo john larroquette , whom hardcore genre fans know opening narrator 1974 original texas chain saw massacre ) . story proper drawn script originally written independently tv series -- which probably why it rises head shoulders above it -- many its elements read like homage george romero classic night living dead ( 1968 ) more than offspring series or comics inspired i t.t he second feature bordello blood ( 1996 ) . many fans critics panned this one bromidic therefore unworthy follow-up demon knight , while it true many story elements worn vampire-movie clich�s , film certainly delivers what tales crypt title promises genre fans . plot involves beautiful redheaded super-vampiress who manipulated smug , ingratiating christian evangelist into running vampire brothel serves lure society undesirables their doom . chris sarandon riotously chews scenery perverse proselytizer , snl alum dennis miller delivers lots laughs cynical pi hired locate teenage victim whoring vamps . film biggest fault probably gratuitous ta misogynistic undertones , but considering 50% mainstream film industry target audience horny teenage males , such elements hardly surprising . other words , bordello blood admittedly not high cinema , but there loads things keep genre fans interested , its overall tone more line tv show spawned it than its predecessor , demon knigh t.t he digital transfers both films clear crisp , while short extras , each film paired its original theatrical trailer . all all , this dvd duo well worth reasonable asking price	1

omagh film which shows us full cycles disaster .. we see characters before bomb , we see them during explosion , we see aftermath , then we see politics .. movie leaves unresolved bad taste mouth .. ever optomistic main character ( mcsorley ) announces media they finally begin moving forward .. but seems little consolation cover-up went government , ira , media .. we reminded some regards aftermath 9-11 .. politics media actually detract truth .. this film packs powerful puch gut should considered carefully .	1
clocking just under two hours , i love your work leaves viewer feeling though opening sequence stones tied your feet your body thrown into very deep dank water slowly settle into mud bottom . sound dreary ? then avoid this little mess film . it hard believe adrian butchart who giving us radiant goal ! dream begins trilogy could help write this script : one wonders if writer/director adam goldberg didn't just bring him help . story tired ( small time guy gives up love career movie star all accessories money , fame , celeb status , gorgeous wife , etc . only find life its simpler fashion preferable ) choices casting this very dark dreary tale inappropriate . giovanni ribisi , superb actor though he most assuredly , simply not credible movie star sex symbol whose stardom accompanied alcoholism , self hate , paranoia , fragmented thinking , bad decisions . only time we see anything vaguely suggestive his ability create role many flashback scenes ( girlfriend christina ricci ): his screen chemistry his famous wife mia ( enormously talented franka potente who here wasted mannequin role ) nil , his interplay such actors vince vaughn , marisa coughlan , judy greer , shalom harlow , joshua jackson , jason lee , elvis costello unilateral . goldberg films this boring redundant tale using all manner artsy camera tricks only serve make tedium increase . cast like this product promise . goldberg needs some time think this phase his career . grady harp , november 06	1

bandidas movie originally supposed get nationwide studio release , but never happened , so now moviegoers buy dvd surprisingly good movie . movie tells story sara , rich spoiled girl , maria , poor farmhand who lives her father . new york banking company arrives area trying acquire land bank rights hopes building railroad through mexico . process , sara father killed maria wounded . two women completely different backgrounds team up begin robbing those banks , sara revenge maria give land money back people . plot pretty simple , but this movie entertaining throughout . main reason most people pick this up because penelope cruz salma hayek western doesn't sound too shabby , they're right . both women incredibly gorgeous script gives them several chances show off their " talents . " but even more than , bandidas funny some pretty well-done action scenes keep your attention throughout . too few westerns released nowadays , so don't let this one slip . sharing top billing , cruz hayek play maria sara , two women opposite sides track who team up rob banks . mentioned , these women gorgeous , but they seem genuinely good time it shows final product . movie also gives them chance show off their comedic chops some fun action scenes movie fans might not seen before . steve zahn , lucky man he , costars quentin , crime scene analyst ( think 19th century csi ) who finds himself side bandidas while they fight over him . zahn very good part , steals some scenes his facial expressions alone . dwight yoakam plays jackson , lowly bank representative trying hunt down capture maria sara . small part , sam shepard takes part bill buck , grizzled old bank robber himself who teaches maria sara " rules " robbing bank . dvd offers good commentary stars hayek cruz , 5-minute featurette interviews duo making movie , theatrical trailer . so overall , don't scared away bandidas straigh t-t o-video release . it plenty action , humor , two gorgeous leading ladies . don't miss bandidas	1
i first saw orson welles artsy adaptation franz kafka masterpiece some twenty years ago . stark images this black white film stuck me ever since . very young anthony perkins ( he made this film couple years after psycho ) stars joseph ., ordinary insurance clerk who wakes up one morning find himself under arrest . despite his best efforts , . cannot find anyone who or tell him crime which he charged . after series distressing conversations , respectively , closed-mouth arresting authorities , his narrow-minded landlady his paranoid fellow boarder ( exotic dancer ) , he frantically searches throughout his unnamed city , progressively more disturbing encounters ( beautiful seductive young woman webbed fingers , mass children hysterically playing maze-like building , etc . ) . movie director makes appearance advocate who may or may not answers . ' questions . virtually everything this movie symbolic meaning -- every sideways glance , every slip tongue ( listen closely during unnerving initial interrogation where perkins nails two freudian slips one after other ) . much film set bombed out , abandoned railway station , which only adds viewer uneasiness . also much movie filmed dark , certainly symbolic movie theme . film score arrangement adagio albiononi concerto minor . its slow , dark sad melody fits tone movie perfectly . this not entertaining or ' feel good ' movie . it -- like classic novel upon which it based -- intriguing , horrifying unforgetable . orson welles believed this his finest film . it certainly most intellectually-satisfying horror film i've ever seen .	1

derek jarman ' sebastiane ' momentous painting which simply brushed film rather than canvas . this master work should any serious film buff cabinet . ( i should very much like see it running continuously upon smooth stone wall monumental pillared vestibule - perhaps like four seasons new york . it visual beauty should constantly view . not one element could added or deleted . if i may continue painting analogy , each stroke , whether finished or raw melds this work into composition which i think flawless . men beautiful , but tangible human manner . settings , whether diocletian startling lurid palace or rough bare terrain sardinia evoke both pagan christian motifs flawlessly . good evil ( all shades ) found both places ; irony world it always . homoerotic nature film vicseral , candid rather than overtly condescending - it might well set modrn iraq 21st century troops . i felt each character longings , whether god carnal flesh or human love companionship or spiritual other worldly deity . recognituion each these forms eros may entertwine meld genious . it everyman . it scrupulus portrait easily duplicit qualities beauty , deceipt , brutality even truth . powerful stuff .	1
those us who went through " josie grossie " stage , this movie welcome comedy , sort revenge nerds meets princess diaries . josie gellar ( drew barrymore ) , 25-year-old copy editor/reporter , never quite gotten over her traumatic high school years , replete bad hair days insensitive classmates . understandably , she mixed emotions when her boss , noticing how young she looks , decides josie go undercover give " sun " readers latest scoop high school life . so back fast times ridgemont high ... not only josie anxious this assignment , but she worried her personal life . 25 , josie never even kissed guy ( or rather , kissed guy) -- but she doesn't just want kiss any guy , but someone really special . while researching this high school expose , josie painful flashbacks she witnesses how kids treat each other . ( woman pretty drew barrymore would willing look bad she possibly sheer dedication her art ! ) through her brother influence popular kids ( he earns coolness points local baseball phenomenon ) , josie gets inducted alpha crowd unwittingly slights her " uncool " ( second-time around ) high school friends . josie enjoys her english class surprises her teacher , uber-handsome sam coulson , her love words knowledge subject . meanwhile , sun eavesdrops josie her high school adventures . sam ( michael vartan ) , noplussed josie maturity yet apparent youth . when he learns josie undercover reporter , he becomes hurt angry . josie tries apologize through very tabloid brought her trouble -- readers anxiously await see if sam meet josie baseball stadium deliver her first kiss before appointed time . ( let me interject my own two cents here : michael vartan hot ... he my ideal body type , sigh ... i writhing jealousy during kissing scene ! )this movie hilarious well-written . it accused formulaic , but so what ? it good message very funny . my friends i never tire watching this movie , expression , " josie grossie " taken life its own . when we show pictures our childhood each other , we often qualify them , " this picture taken my josie grosie years . " ( you know , glasses , braces , bad hair , works ... ) or , even our grown-up years , we'll tell each other if we're feeling particularly josie grossie given day .	1
i thoroughly enjoyed animals would liked more info given them . movie pure entertainment wonderful color [ except coloring tiger black ] weird ! they leave off technical jargon - i want hear animals how some scenes shot - how actors played their parts etc . what rigors actors go through ? set making interesting oh , yeah , didn't they know anything horses ? definitely fun movie	1
i find it odd when reviewing reviews this film people seem either give it perfect or abysmal scores . dichotomy opinion probably direct result skill immense power leconte images , ( especially those his chosen actress affords us ) . leconte master quite possibly greatest living auteur currently making films . his movies often contain refreshing difficulty gives one hope images still mean something , film still worthy explicated , someone still cares enough think much without overly clever such coens anderson . i shouldn't say still . i should say , leconte different level than any who ever worked including kieslowski ( master images ) . i enjoy how leconte said although it his second period piece he approached film if nothing it , learning " ridicule " . i should point out i no problem " ridicule " fact it period piece great deal presentation , but i see what he meant . like i said , i enjoy statement , but i should also point out i'm jerk . binoche auteuil two my favorite actors this film shows them their virtuosic best . they deliver amazing performances truly passionate couple who both hold unconditional love other which itself contains ultimate trust decision character . possibly more auteuil binoche but sympathy generated his character fuels her equally sharing partner , making any difference negligible . there third character , neel , but he there only accentuate relationship other two . movie , quite simply unconditional love what it means love unconditionally . there subplot equal merits ( mainly concerning neel ) belief redemption , what it truly means believe redemption . short it consequences action through belief , more so out love than those moral ground or stance . some people not willing accept belief actions or should occur solely out sympathy . some people never allow themselves love unconditionally . some people not understand or even like this film . binoche deserves prize doesn't yet exist her most exquisite performance . leconte deserves recognition what he what he given us this film , certainly one best i ever seen .	1
infamy artists going fame . pure uncut through decadesit all there . all phat beats mad stlyes there but end thats it . movie displays illegal crime activity what happens next . some flashbacks movie pretty macabre . this really though hardcore bombing different cities . this essence graffiti it cry props world none	1
great show series " masters horror " . this episode ellen ( bree turner ) driving through mountains when she accident . she goes check other car when she runs into psycho freak moonface ( john de santis ) . there subsequent babe chased through woods killer , but twist ; she trained survivalist who set up neat rambo-like booby traps forest . she finally taken obligatory house horrors . you tell there much this story than first meets eye . production value top notch , it looks great , even if it kind " friday 13th " knock-off . horror favorite angus scrimm here , this time he plays much more animated character than tall man . he guy knows what going explains it . really stand out feature woman ellen , who much stronger than usual scream-queen ; more like buffy vampire slayer . if there one complaint it this ; don coscarelli notorious his quirky horror fantasy " phantasm " , but there little quirky wit here , it just straight stalk slash slasher . other wise great entry wonderful series .	1

my grandmother introduced me danny kaye movies starting white christmas court jester . later i found movies like secret life walter mitty just funny . i hooked danny kaye actor/comedian . this not one his outrageously hilarious movies . it sad beautiful wonderful plotline . wonderful cast compliments danny kaye musical score fantastic -- very jazzy rag . louis armstrong duets danny kaye voice well trumpet ( coronet ) . my favorite song lullabye ragtime , though . they manage meld two different melodies perfectly . movie focuses life red nichol ( danny kaye ) small-town coronet player trying make it big music industry . he falls love gets married , but just he starting make it big-time his wife gets pregnant . they take baby road them long they but it no life child . eventually she sent boarding school where she contracts polio . red so overcome guilt he gives up everything he music industry help his daughter get well walk again . time she grown up able stand again she forgotten her father ever music industry . red wife all his old band buddies want him happy get back into music , but red keeps falling into depression punishing himself his daughter polio . it ends beautifully all his band buddies turning out hear him play his daughter walking towards him without her cane them dancing together . it makes me cry every time . i would highly recommend this anyone feel good , slice-of-life movie both it joyous highs rock-bottom lows .	1
i think i like this season much more than than season 2 . only thing time i truly find out sort fact they didn't format episodes chronilogical order . episode el viejo placed second disc ( i believe second disc ) which comes after episode showing how crockett lost his black car ( before he gets testerosa ) . all honest i believe episode accidently left out season 2 . but spite little minor detail i believe anyone who buys seasons 3 4 won't sorry .	1
i don't see why people making so much noise against this movie . we all know this isn't history class . we all know this isn't realistic any way . it not it not supposed be!i've never heard people say : " musical version three musketeers gene kelly isn't faithful book " . frankly , who cares ? if you want true story , realistic story , get book or documentary . what we here true " popcorn movie " , kind film you put your dvd player nice evening " no thinking , just enjoying " . this hollywood family movie , 3 great stars , fancy costumes , beautiful scenery great music . me , this some best entertainment ! kind entertainment cinema invented so succesful 40s 50s . it seems me people today just can't enjoy kind entertainment anymore . that sad ! so , please , stop complaining just enjoy pete sake , lol	1
i mark points off because weirdness nick bottom wife , but i don't really mind all much change scene ( although characters might better named things like lorenzo antonio , but i don't like quibble over these things . much . ) otherwise , it all very fun . rustic players my favorite part . michelle pfeiffer okay titania , but rupert everett better oberon . calista flockhart appropriately befuddled " painted maypole . " she appear tall ! other reviewer who posted eyebrow-raising range accents right . sheeeesh . actress who played ' ermia worst , but thankfully , cockney twang sort faded end movie . all all , very enjoyable	1

i first saw this when i like 6 years old . i remember renting this my mom cousin . like lot people , my mom no idea who david cronenberg . well , she known , i'm sure she would not let her 6 year old son watch flick . main thing i remember this guy getting his arm torn off baboon getting pulverised . those pretty gross scenes . however , i buy this recently , realized , yes it still gross , it not age extremely well . but , i must say , jeff goldblum pretty good . he bit too quirky first , but i figured they wanted him this geeky guy so when his fly-like abilities started kicking , it would show extreme opposite what his original character . this would also cause sympathy towards end even though he became , basically dick middle movie . i suggest buying this , especially cronenberg fans	1
love story all , great acting , great script , great music , great cinematography , great directing . i appreciate this film	1
i originally purchased this 2 dvd set 1959 lana turner /juanita moore second screen version which it includes . i captivated emotional storyline , especially juanita moore presence . highlight film mahalia jackson singing " trouble world . " after viewing 1959 version , i pleasently surprised find 1934 claudette colbert / louise beavers version included this set even more captivating . while basic plotline same , characters bit more down earth , therefore more relatable most people . there also better love story this version . it easy see why it acadamy award nominated best picture . both these films choose wonderful option dvd viewing . reason i docked it star , because i initialy found it difficult decipher which film which side dvd , since it written such tiny print around center ring , so i flip dvd first couple times i watched it , until i figured it out . course , could just me	1
this movie roc-a-fella films production different their other recent movies because this one funny hell ! roc-a-fella recording artists such beanie sigel , memphis bleek , noreaga , jay-z , damon dash more great see acting but , kevin hart man this funny comedy !	1

this couple young actors then ( gene kelly frank sinatra opening his wings stardom ) so distant respect their respective would depart them . this amusing entertained movie deal some ins outs respect two sailors who license during four days l.a. consequence valorous act heroism total conveyance . funny musical deserves all your attention , due one most original suggestive musicals ever made .	1
whilst i find comedy greats series personally more enjoyable , you cant go past interviews like brando or welles . cavett somethingn naturally accessible because i think he very close " average " person this position . or rather , he makes it look way . brando interview astounding : he arrogant , genius , mad ? make up your own mind but you wont able turn it off ! welles comes across like no other alive today : he spent time greats , lived among them dont miss his anecdotes churchill . better than run mill rubbish tv today , i assure you . oh yes , groucho makes yet appearance . cant get enough him neither could cavett it seemed	1

grand-daddy all vampire movies - there may earlier ones , but murnau 1922 nosferatu one we all remember - still pretty effective . count orlok ( max schreck ) wants buy house bremen , na�ve ambitious real estate agent hutter travels his gloomy castle deal . while there hutter spills little blood ( those red marks his neck aren't , he believes , pesky mosquitoes ) , worse , he drops cameo portrait his `pure ' wife ellen (`nice neck ' ) under , er , robust nose contract-signing count . if you've seen any vampire movie made since then , there thousands them , you pretty much connect dots set-up end . nosferatu least frightening , yet most disturbing , movie i've seen . set against deserted barren landscapes cragged castles enveloping arches , populated characters who flow one extreme pose , shadowed freudian debris blistered imagination bram stoker , framed focused through expressionist lens german director f.w. murnau , nosferatu filmed nightmare . today standards acting broadly melodramatic resoundingly bad , ham upon ham . orlok , dracula character , taloned pointy-toothed grotesque . poor hutter bouncing halfwit . nobody nothing reflects reality this picture , least waking reality . honest , nosferatu didn't begin work me right away . i saw it years ago bad vhs tape wasn't very impressed . image print clean , many delicately tinted sequences ( original , i believe ) good commentary track . still , after first viewing i something close my original reaction . i watched it couple other times after , once commentary track , found acting increasingly less distracting images more insinuating disturbing . it certainly movie grows each viewing . highly recommended .	1

i bought this movie because manson it i appreciate his artistic ability . also , prior buying movie i read description thought plot sounded interesting . movie , though not terrible , not excel any criteria . acting seems forced , special effects poor , plot starts get repetitive uninteresting . manson , most stars , only movie very brief periods time . movie revolves around screwed up mother who retrieves her son his foster parents after 6 years . mother addicted drugs neglects her child while exposing him evil outside world . many scenes no relevance actual movie end movie there no apparent moral or lesson . if you want see " dark " movie such this one fantastic acting actual plot i would recommend requiem dream	1
i loved this movie just much first one which just much critics hated it . i don't know why i still read what they say because they led me astray way too many times . especially when it comes movie like this where i know before hand i probably like it . i loved fact they continued this movie damn near right after ending first one , i enjoyed graphic nature series . who cares special effects if story keeps you engaged all way through , least enough get over any possible crappy fx scenerios . if you want great special effects , but crappy plot , go watch van helsing . that one movie i consider terrible	1

early going , i thought choice four five stars . movie progressed , my rating dropped somewhere three four , so clearly first half movie better than second . ending so disappointing i drop my rating two stars . it polish man france who marries french girl but divorced her because he unable make love her . he returns poland without her , manages get rich , comes up plot get revenge his beloved dominique . problem this writing he loves her , so why he plotting revenge against her ? it senseless . ending utterly surreal . she should hate him what he her , but she smiling him . he looking her crying . he betrayed her cruel way . he doesn't right crying her . like hitler crying jews . he still position help her out , but he won't . it really pretty sickening . story becomes unclear enough it , without adding some fantasy scenes or memories wedding kiss . it left me angrily saying " what hell going ? " i really hate it when director becomes unclear plays audience . i don't find cute all . tell damn story tell it clearly . besides , ending sucks	1
before he batman , christian bale turned film world it ear his incredible performance this adaptation bret easton ellis ' controversial novel . bale stars wall street yuppie patrick bateman , who living good life indulgent 80 . night , bateman psychotic serial killer whose masterful routine coming apart seams . while it uneven moments , bale star making performance worth seeing american psycho alone . no one else could brought character patrick bateman life better than bale , rest cast , including reese witherspoon , justin theroux , josh lucas , jared leto , willem dafoe , chloe sevigny , samantha mathis ; great well supporting characters too obsessed themselves realize or care what patrick doing . spectacular satire showcase bale talents ; american psycho isn't quite classic , but it pretty close regardless	1
its kinda hard me admit i watched laguna beach this premier season hills , especially all jokes i make two series . but exact target age both shows ( 20 years old ) , i feel into original laguna beach watching it it aired durring final stretch my senior year high school so i small emotional connection show characters where going through same things tha i when it air . season two three laguna beach though where boarderline annoying i found myself barely ever watching them . but hills different , lauren always my favorite ' character ' it pretty interesting actually see her grew out her teenage self into young woman - all fictionalization came it ... hills follows lauren she moves los angeles ( but i'm pretty sure its santa monica ) , how life changes her she enrolls fashion school gets internship teen vogue all drama comes her roomate , coworker , exboyfriend , growing up	1

no doubt " world war " probably best documentary ever made second world war but since beginning i problems playing this dvd set various dvd players . i consider myself serious dvd collector trying keep every disc clean possible following every instruction avoid scratches dirt . i know very first dvds this series sold public problematic but i thought mine weren't . yet , almost three years purchase , 3 out 5 discs completely unplayable althought none them no noticeable scratch . needless say i tested them many computer dvds stand-alone players various brands without success . i not know if this problem related fact these only dual-layered double-sided discs ( dvd 18 ) i ever seen because vast majority dvds sold around single-sided single-layered ( dvd5 ) or single sided double-layered ( dvd9 ) none them brought me such headaches . i wasted us$ 99 , 99 something i expected last much much longer .	1
begin , i am not big fan cary grant , except his hitchcock movies , where he excellent . i enjoy him much katharine hepburn bringing up baby . he very good eagle hawk fredric march . he tolerable philadelphia story talk town . friend mine loaned me this dvd ; she just bought it . i wanted see what cary would this film , i wanted see him dress . start , movie slow boring , all jokes so lame not all funny . i also don't go films where man woman yell each other dislike each other , then some point realize it really love they feel each other . come ! i just can't understand sort romance situation . i felt cary showed " mean streak " he show some his films , romance situation this story . i rate this one star because it one those films you get bored right beginning it sort torture waiting it finally end . all while i kept saying , " let move , let end this thing , when he put dress ?... " but they dragged it out boring , corny jokes . part we wanted see , cary dress , very end not very much . overall , this film real disappointment letdown . only consolation i saw it free ; i didn't buy it or rent it . still , i wasted good time i could used more profitable enjoyable way . i would even enjoyed washing kitchen full dirty dishes more than watching this movie ! sum it up , very very boring dumb movie , not waste your time .	-1
volume 5 far my favorite volume my-hime series ! this volume explores not only main characters , but other hime well little more than previous ones . now hime must fight one , everyone struggles seem come surface plot grows darker . there none those annoying filler episodes either , so you won't need worry entertained ! if you pay attention , you catch certain hints dropped throughout volume further explored connected volume 6 .	1

i love , love , love this movie . every time i watch this movie i am enthralled great acting beautiful yet haunting music . this movie very little dialogue , however , it very memorable piece art . thandie newton plays woman who lost her husband cruel injustices her african country moves rome study medicine . she supports herself live maid pianist . very early movie we learn her employer fallen love her . when she laughs his advances he begs her let him prove his love her . she eventually tells him only way he prove his love free her husband his african prison . he realizes then she married but he made promise prove his love goes selling his art furniture free her husband . haunting beauty this film up close shots thandie newton face she expresses joy , sadness , fear remorse . she expresses all her emotions without speaking words draws audience inside her we experience her inner turmoil . she realizes what her employer doing her her husband she slowly begins realize she some feelings him . yet , because lack dialogue we never sure whether her feelings result her gratefulness or true desire . my only sore point ending this film leaves you hanging . you want beautiful african maid her white lovestruck employer together , but we not get american style finished ending . we left make our own interpretations . i am actually going purchase this movie soundtrack . that how wonderful i think it	1
yes , some acting bad . yes , story isn't plausible . yes , special effects should better . but , hey this movie . i gave it 4 stars because casper van dien movie . i like see him movies but i little disappointed because he didn't even his shirt off . ok , unless you casper van dien fan or movie fan you probably not enjoy this movie . but , if you realize it movie it some good acting it , you may just enjoy it	1
you tell this movie released 1998 because you still see new york twin towers standing , because groveling incantations " islam religion peace , " repeated often enough ( casting good guy arab cop , tony shalhoub ) offset any pc-incorrect image portraying islamofascist terrorism . measure how silly this movie appears rearview mirror 2006 all ghastly islamofascist atrocities since 9/11 first terrorist scene movie , where denzel washington fbi agent tries , via megaphone , talk terrorists down hostage situation . he succeeds getting terrorists let children exit bus . jihadis conscience -- now where we ever seen this actually happen - beslan ( 186 children killed) ? london ? madrid ? mumbai ? only old people start exit bus second appeal denzel bus blow up . after series bombings new york supermarkets , movie theaters , restaurants , etc ., pressure builds call u.s. army under martial law . bruce willis , army commander who take this task , warns time again this isn't proper role army , but then , one president advisors explains movie , if this just one those political things , " president wants appear presidential . " remember , this 1998 , though critics movie , such new yorker , refer willis character " fascist u.s. army general " , decision grant him martial law authority would , ahem , none other than bill clinton . movie slides little detail , however , make it look like willis , all his own , rounding up all able-bodied men muslim persuasion ( less draconian , way , than rounding up all japanese-americans west coast fdr , where threat less real imminent than this movie , but let not talk , either ; we're still 1998 , after all ) . course , cia comes its usual whipping hollywood , where cia agent annette bening kept crucial facts herself because she personal scores settle -- you see , she one who trained armed some these terrorists who now running amok . oh , yeah , sure , women-hating al-qaeda types would allow somebody like pretty annette train them ! but best nonsense comes end : denzel washington handful fbi agents rush into army combat hq somehow surround bruce willis pull their guns , saying he under arrest " violating constitution " ( hey , why aren't they arresting guy who ordered martial law , bill clinton ? ) . general clueless security detail also draws its guns , there mexican standoff . denzel , using same powers persuasion freed least kiddies islamofascist murder bus , appears succeeding talking army soldiers out using their guns protect willis . so willis accepts situation , allows himself arrested , credits roll we see all these army vehicles leaving brooklyn shame -- all it took bust " fascist " general . ta-dah ! so movie , heap literary license , proves least one point end : back 1990s , it didn't take much bill clinton wuss out avoid taking terrorists . meanwhile , some day , sooner or later , idea pre-emptive internment jihad-age muslim men defensive measure indeed catch , if not here , then perhaps france , netherlands , russia , israel -- it interesting see who goes first . because it not just newtonian laws physics decree every action there equal opposite reaction . when they sequel this preposterous movie new york sans world trade center , willis play part hero , whoever gets stuck fbi agent role fool . i give movie two stars instead one , because i would hate discourage making such sequel , two , because any movie annette bening it automatically gets extra star my book	1
man , some my all-time favorite skits this wonderful compilation here . some reason , monty python crew decided re-do skits , so instead their original form , skits slightly different sets costuming , but ( thankfully ) masterful dialogue not altered any way . i guess crew felt original skits weren't 100% true their vision , so they made few changes match their original intent . one many stand-outs dirty hungarian phrasebook , where poor hungarian man thinks he asking cigarettes when he says , " drop your panties sir william . " marriage counselor who flirts man wife because man sissy anything it . still accountant who wants liontamer , provided lions aren't much different anteaters . course you'd expect classics like dead parrot sketch , nudge , nudge , lumberjack song , last but not least upper-class twit-of-the-year , which happens appropriate finale . my personal favorite sketch expedition mt . kilamarjaro , where john cleese sees two everything unless he covers up one his eyes . i also get kick out sketch where people fall out high buildings . this movie here contains best writing some best comedians ever walk earth . it real treasure every sense word	1
this movie great . this movie " dark " feeling it . it reminds me " 50 " . it great deal motorcycle stunts , music very good . again music reminds me " 50 also . movie not real serious movie . it sort tongue cheek movie . michael pare , diane lane , amy madigan good it	1
director : denzel washingtoncast : denzel washington , derek luke , joy bryant , salli richardson , malcolm david kelley , cody hodges , leonard earl howze , novella nelson . running time : 120 minutesrated pg-13 violence , language mature thematic material involving child abuse . based true story , screenplay written eponymous hero his own book , " antwone fisher " heart study psychological disturbance , laced reasonable amounts hollywood sugar optimism human spirit . it peculiarly american medicine , swallowed less willingly some markets than others , which probably explains why criticism film often confused denzel washington directorial talents ( which generally good ) various workings his film plot , which argued . antwone fisher story starts navy , where after particularly vivid nightmare he slugs fellow shipmate , hauled up before captain . sent navy psychiatrist jerome davenport ( washington ) , he begins work out issues anger , it turns out , stem abused childhood which added guilt complex over dead friend . same time fisher ( played exceptionally well newcomer derek luke ) , struggles establish first adult romantic relationship inviting cheryl ( joy bryant ) . parallel plot thread , washington character , ever-reasonable dr. davenport , marital problems . due course we discover he things learn communicating too fisher catalyst his own change . fisher screenplay reached cameras somewhat circuitous route : after his stint navy little writing experience , he hired sony executive write his own story - process which apparently underwent over 40 drafts before it acceptable . most weaknesses film traced uncertainties he brings his new craft , although washington direction papers reasonably well over many cracks . most unconvincing elements those subplots revolve around main character . these include psychiatrist ironic domestic problems , well fisher tentative love life . one tempted see these narrative distractions rather manipulative bolt-on elements , leavening appeal central , harrowing , personal history . fisher - cheryl romance instance , while context necessarily clumsy , also ultimately gauche . once consummated , it left languish without further comment , if further exploration this side fisher maturing unnecessary . perhaps sensing this central weakness , fisher script introduces element into young african-american tortured life foster child . during flashbacks he deal ' slave-nation ' justifications mrs. tate ( novella nelson ) , suggesting link hurt individual presumably whole black race - reasoning which frankly unconvincing none too interesting . significantly , such issues given short shrift psychiatrist himself , soon disappear view . plus side central performance derek luke hero , perfectly judged acting job , neatly balances inner rage confusion - " i don't know what " - lack self-pity . washington role also well . given difficulty actor-director role , he applauded carrying off both so effectively without fuss , either front or behind camera . this washington directorial debut he admirable job painting thorough picture antwone even though film could benefited some tighter editing , it still film delivers all emotional goods . arguably most impressive thing this film casting luke who total unknown actor mere handful television credits his resume obviously washington knew he possessed right goods pull off role . despite its flaws , " antwone fisher " intriguing look into real life estranged , enigmatic individual ; it film stimulate heart make you wish small children didn't endure such horrors .	1

guy who gave three stars some good points . he quite justified his three star review . however , way i see it , this one few films ( battle sounds only one i think right off bat ) really attempts explore art scratching deliver it wide audience . it true many dj left out scratch , but i think overall goal achieved . first all , film extremely well made . it artful , excellent soundtrack , good flow it some excellent interviews . there many dj weren't included partially because it 92 minute film can't possibly encompass all influential scratch dj . i respect this film immensely due fact it really opening people eyes what art scratching all . i mean eddie def right when he talks burger king dj etc . image djing kind position that easily filled any dumbass turntables " fresh " sample ridiculous . i'll admit , this film introduced me scratching . i've scratching two years now it become my obsession . i thank this film introducing me artform . course i can't review this film point view veteran scratch dj , but i review it scratch dj . if you want learn more scratching , or if you already scratch , then i highly suggest this film or battle sounds . if no other reason , some interviews ( especially some left out final cut ) worth buying this movie .	1
french new wave justifiably famous cinema circles , schools , etc .. it still talked today . when they mention filmmakers came school filmmaking , they mention jean-luc godard , eric rohmer , francois truffault . rarely , if ever , they mention jacques rivette . when friend mine asked me my favorite french directors , i said robert bresson , jean-luc godard , jacques rivette . my friend said " rivette ? " jacques rivette films stand out any other french filmmaker his time . other french new wave filmmakers prolific , whereas rivette would make film every few years . rivette films generally very long ( most extreme example film out 1 , which runs 12 1/2 hours , his other films run average 3-4 hours ) , concern themselves artistic process . this 4 hour film ( slightly longer than most rivette films , but not longest ) , but it unfolds magisterially beautifully . i saw it theater ( intermission ) , i entralled . it one rivette best films , one really shows agony artistic creation . creating art long arduous process . kubrick compared his art , filmmaking , trying write war peace bumpy car ride , but when you've finished , it amazing feeling . its pacing very slow leisurely , but there isn't anything wrong . i didn't feel bored , i didn't feel film needed cut . it perfect way it . title translated " pretty nuisance " , those who curious . this film really captures . completely unrelated sidenote , i remember seeing this film 2 couples front me . women liked it , but men bored out their minds . one kept shifting his head back forth throughout whole thing . men probably just hoping get laid afterwards , so that why they went see it . you should really only see this film if you're committed art cinema person . luckily , i am . this one rivette best films , he filmmaker deserves better known .	1

ok , this movie hilarious . i saw it when it test-screened last year la . back then i thought it so funny totally original it would theatres . i guess big studio bought it but didn't put it out theatrically . it so clever sarcastic you remember it lot more than your normal popcorn studio comedy . first all , " asexual " photographers gunther gerd off hook . they dress identically these ridiculous outfits , one mute while other read his mind . they point out they're not gay , they only spoon . they're always fighting over who gonna inner or outer spoon . lol . movie this magazine editor who organizes photo shoot world greatest supermodels . jaime pressly so funny editor . she obsessed supermodels , their posters all over her room fantasizes supermodels want make her one them . main supermodel played brooke burns , bruce willis ' old girlfriend . i thought she'd just eye candy , but she funniest playing german supermodel . guys dig movie because hot supermodels bikinis like entire movie , but we like it because we get see these vain creatures killed off symbolic really funny ways . it really smart comedy .	1
i first found out this movie you tube . i watch montage all best parts set some gorgeous music . after those 5:15 minutes i sold ... i went straight amazon , read reviews promptly placed my order . next 10 days longest my life , when it finally arrived i tore it open i wasn't dissappointed !! keely hawes personal favourite james murray now definately new favourite !! i somewhat dissappointed first length film , because i am accustomed my great period dramas ( ie our mutual friend , wives daughters ) anything 4-8 hours long !! so 1 half hours seemed mere preview first . but second time round i admit story fit perfectly into time frame . all all wonderful movie , wil leave you warm , mushy feeling we know so well !! making featurette quite interesting , although always , not enough time time given stars show !!! my recommendation : buy it now !! its lovely addition your bbc library	1

this film robert bresson beautiful sad . made same ambience tone his ' au hazard bathasar ' but not exciting it . i don't know where you coming , but if you interested intimistic basically plotless cinema , found foreign ( old ) movies , bresson good choice . but if your reason making spiritual journey , or or widening your faith , then , you must warned . ' diary ... ' pure doubt . doubt main character , rural priest , doubt director . tone sadness experience watchibng this film what mostly impresses me . other than , what stays my mind end story following thoughts : ) story-teller ( bresson ) makes us reflect inutily believing god , or acting if god exists , if he exist , life present , my circumstance , reality , now , what i feel , cancer i suffer , pain i feel , so real , so more real than god love i want believe but i doubt . this impression this film communicating me . ) everybody cruel . this people don't even deserve my love them . how i love them . why should i different ? it would crazy . what would my argument sustained ( case young priest ) order prove these people wrong their believes their actions ? god , his mercy love ? they look me they despise me ! or they pity me like fool ! sad . so this not really story , it just depiction tormented soul , realization we so imperfect , so weak ( would bresson even say " sinful " ? ) , fool-on-the-moon lament . cry wasteland . what you when you hungry ? you eat food , or you cry it blame it hungry ? same god . there certain resemblance this film way great historian arnold toynbee depicts disintegrating societies : there sense drift , which people yield meaningless determinism , if their efforts not matter , if they no control over their lives . there sense guilt , self-loathing comes their moral abandon . drift guilt . these nouns apply well young priest parishioners . whole postmodern pandemonium .	1

when i first saw round midnight young man , i thought dale turner real jazz musician wondered what he made him avoid america , like roman polanski . that tribute good acting dexter gordon direction bertrand tavernier , who i understand swiss . tight close-ups 1959 blue note reverberate sweat reality . recently i chance watch this film tandem michael curtiz young man horn i saw some similarities way gordon photographed john alton shadows stripes across his handsome face , just juano hernandez given almost noir treatment earlier film , heated nightclubs where everyone wears cigarette out side their mouth smoke makes feverish patterns across whitewashed walls .. i wish dvd included some memories film makers , including some testimony tavernier see if he really studied earlier american jazz films or not . young french jazz buff grows close dale who then becomes his idol , shares acting duties film , just dale sweats out his addiction liquor but what he can't shake his love/hate affair new york city america whole . ambivalence factor young frenchman just can't understand ; it goes way over his head leaves him standing far shores love even banks east river . i suppose if this movie made usa this character ( francis ) would played woman ( like doris day ) young man weith horn , usa men aren't allowed give each other adoring looks francois gives dale this one . given time period ( 1986 ) perhaps part would offered robin givens or lisa bonet ? it we get incandescent lonette mckee her finest , singing beautifully too . film goes great lengths prove francis solidly heterosexual , pro-family , his parents cute little daughter . david rayfiel , who wrote this paean black-white relationships , years favorite screenwriter sydney pollack , also wrote amazing rape revenge picture lipstick . he true journeyman here he gave dexter gordon part should won him oscar .	1

i love this movie ! it so incredibly stupid funny . it absolutely ridiculous slightly crass . grinch whos look like bunch clowns . film predictable completely ripped off animated tv special . this isn't stupid barney , because least makers this film actually tried funny , rather than just childish retarded . this film gotten lot mixed reviews amazon.com, so sure rent it before you buy it .	1
three things save this dvd fom trashcan - one selection kqed-tv black white performances ( although whole show available vhs ) . two very interesting films band recording " summertime " studio cheap thrills album . three course janis . she shines . those who only know her visually still photos monterey pop film , you may find yourself surprised how very attractive she every way . still photos never her justice . unfortunately , beyond these three saving graces this hour long documentary lackluster , managing make this incredibly exciting period american rock roll just plain boring , social revolution which fed it . most band performances within documentary nothing short embarrassing , profoundly bad , bad guitar , bad bass , bad backing vocals , just sloppy timing . when this accompanied lifeless modern interviews band , it tough find pleasure this disc . it comes across , i'm sad say , grown men whining incessantly how nobody liked them everyone liked janis more . even though i've always regarded band live playing cheap thrills alternate evening performance which out there someplace cd brilliant , my opinion big brother abilities ( personal character ) shrunk mightily after watching 900 nights . all bands bad nights , bad recordings out there circulation - most airplane live recordings pretty scary , but nothing like what we here . one would look very hard performance clips made band sound worse . black cherry sour whipped cream found extras , where each band member asked how he heard janis ' death . peter albin james gurley responses bloodless shameful . honest perhaps , but show little class guys . remember you're part legendary band one reason one reason alone . if it wasn't one particular lady , no one would know your names . stop whining . get over it . you got fired because you pretty lousy band who couldn't keep time or play decent solos . cheap thrills album sounds like band , frankly	1

it great series , i watch it over again again . sales people miserable salary divided into ' seniors ' ' juniors ' it unbelivable how desperately ' seniors ' try humilate ' juniors ' just prove themselves they better than their wage implies . some jokes easily predictable , like those mr. hamphries ' other way ' or ms. sloucomb she-cat , nevertheless they superb humor . technical note : i cannot comprehend why dvd should close-captioned ( useless feature ) instead sub-titled english ( importand feature movie many british idioms	1
this movie me my wife guessing where it going end . magic this beautiful period movie handled very well , all performances top notch . yet i wouldn't recommend this younger audience ; my children troubled scared several places . older children , questions issues this movie brings up could wonderful conversation starters -- thoughtful pre-teens young teens . again , wonderfully shot acted . sound design music excellent well	1
i wish there - rating system , i would rate this - 10 stars , only good thing this movie john digweed ( he shows up end movie 2 minutes ) bedrocks heaven scent . it such burden watch this whole movie , first all acting horrible waaaaaaay overdone ; pretentious word . acting like watching those kids candy commercials there all these skateboarders " extreme " sports figures doing tricks advertise candy product . then theres all these gay love scenes , which i found very unnecessary . if this movie shows what rave scene really , i feel sorry ravers , fortunately this not what raving all . this story shows corporate-underground ( hmmm those two words shouldnt together , should they ? well they this movie ) rave , you party planner sending e-mails all these yuppys let them know where party , then theres " going party " thing , wharehouse blah blah blah . trying look like real rave , but last i knew raves werent sponsored levis or starbucks !! then you all these horrible actors trying act like there all high ecstasy , they just over it , its like watching your granny trying act like she drunk . then theirs dj who act like their mixing grabbing records , putting them turntable cranking up crossfader , any dj knows its not simple . i'm not trying disrespect dj , i bet john digweed tiny part this movie because he probably got ditched club owner didnt pay him gig he needed money get back home . part movie this " raver-couple " who met each other like 2 days ago getting married , their " love " completely influenced after using ecstasy ( love drug ) dudes brother who complete pretentious nerd . raver dude all sudden kissing dude who supposed official rave massage guy !! i mean wtf ?!!! then his brother ( pret . nerd ) gets hold some , course he never any kind narcotics or substance before , he starts tripping turns into complete fool , he meets chick who supposed veteran raver she tries guide him around his trip , then party he invites everyone breakfest his house , course doesnt happen because he didnt really like people , he just happy . thank god theres end movie , end you get see digweed playing heaven scent , thats only good part movie it lasts like 2 minutes . oh i forgto mention " police bust " . police arrive party party organizer talks his way gets sngle cop leave without checking any paper work or permit party , then later copps arrive shut party down raid like fashion , but guess what ? no one gets arrested sound equipment doesnt get confiscated , cops just run warehouse run everybody out . course nature this movie wouldnt just let people go home stop filming this atrocity , nooooooooooooooooo , people go back warehouse , break police lock continue party where they left off . totally unreal . raver-couple chick see her boyfriend kissing massage guy runs bathroom cry , her boyfriend follows her tells her he not gay , course they get back together go back dancing , then when partys raver-couple dude sees massage guy tells him " i'm not gay " massage dude replies " nah , me neither " . i hope you got idea how bad movie this review , i got headache writing it .	-1

faith hathaway just graduated high school one week away going into army . she full hope life . robert willie ( man this movie based ) , his accomplice raped murdered her . she raped , stabbed 17 times , raped after she died . director this movie denied requests made faith mother , gave all attention only person who deserved die . where mercy faith ? where compassion faith ? where people protesting faith life ? finally where story mercy which denied faith ? what her suffering her family ? barely foot note this movie . ohh sister prejean discovered lie when it suits her case .	-1

i wanted give movie version end all wars 5 stars but ... there trend lately faith-based entertainment use elements such swearing " keep it real " . perhaps this effort reach broader audience . ... or out defiance what typical faith-based entertainment . but once you've read ernest gordon firsthand account ( published under few different names ) you proof same moving powerful story told without language . others concerned like we which words used - it basically word said repeatedly one character 13+ times row moment anger then one time shortly after character . there other words well but never god name used swearing ( which where we would've drawn line ) . other than , movie really gripping . there some tense scenes violence , but there many excellent performances actors . hope this review helpful	1

ok first , if you politicaly correct person who wants nothing offends any one , don " buy this movie !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! now if you except world full offending things laugh them best way deal them , come seat watch this wonderful , trashy satire violance way we become numb it what it . oh yes brothers sisters feel healing powers this tacky road race movie future where war no more only outlet our aggresion sport " deathrace " where besides speed you must earn points running over people race way . david carridine frankenstien worlds greatest driver sport , but he begining think maybe this race no longer what world needs . all kidding aside(sorry if i sounded like preacher , but really i ment ) this satire very funny reminds us politicaly correctness isn't great if it stops us think , not bad message little drive-in movie 70 	1
i never seen queen damned until last night , when i just finished anne rice novel queen damned . knowing i would soon novel , i curious see movie so i went out moviestop picked up cheap , used dvd copy , despite hearing this movie very bad . turns out , word bad understatement . let me get point , there several changes story , i understand some this needs movies screen time reasons , etc . but i found after reading novel , while basic premise story same novel , pretty much everything gave novel plotline it depth intrigue removed story film adaptation , this movie simply falls flat . i shaking my head end movie such disappointment so much story hacked away . vampires this movie not portrayed amount love feeling intended anne rice , akasha included . maharet , perhaps foremost character novel , basically doesn't show up until end movie simply take part disappointing final showdown . again , all backstory should present here missing . i won't spoil it any those who still plan read novel , but akasha motives what she planning actually logical ( her own evil misguided way ) , but there reason it she saw legitemate , where movie it simply " everybody must die ! " . period . that your motive everything movie building up . i can't stress this enough - depth book gone movie . like i said , i understand things need trimmed/skipped sake screen time , etc ., but this movie barely over 1 1/2 hours long , so much plot development could still included here give this movie depth it lacked . what wrong adding even 30-45 minutes screen time fill story make it 120 or 135 minute film ? heck , i sat theatres all three lord rings movies which all ran over 3 hours . or this movie directed punk kids 10 minute attention spans , rather than fans anne rice vampire chronicles ? such shame , because this movie really potential equal , if not better , adaptation interview vampire . i could go other things this movie i thought just stupid , silly , etc . etc . kind like how other vampires pissed lestat revealing himself world vampire giving away vampiric secrets , yet they decide fly up stage during middle concert , front tens thousands people start fighting , essence " revealing " themselves well , which totally inconsistent why these vampires angry first place . i won't go into all details , because it would take too much writing tell you everything bugged me . bottom line , i guess if you're into cheesy vampire action flicks korn , etc . movie score , then you may still see some value here , but anne rice diehards most certainly find this movie waste their time . but don't let this movie scare you out reading novel , because book much much much better than this movie	-1
i love daria this movie very fitting sign off series . however , some unknown reason , mtv found reason make numerous small cuts throughout movie original version it appeared its original broadcast . jokes deleted , natural conversations characters reduced " just facts , ma'am . " least one scene , which daria decides not go date tom favor staying home , totally cut out movie . ??? original soundtrack also replaced generic music backdrop avoid obtaining video distribution rights original music . i recommend buying dvd if you no other way see broadcast version . i just hope someday mtv someday see fit release it uncensored , well complete unedited season releases .

years after its release i find myself writting what i consider completely biast review this film ( somewhat star wars fan made it difficult look it any negative light before ) . let me first start saying my two daughters love film . me , i grew up watching original star wars ( now titled episode iv , new hope ) . when original star wars came out , it changed way people looked sci-fi . i saw it several times just able focus different aspects sets , props , costumes , etc . it best eye-candy its time far . substance became less important factor if movie couple " holes " story we forgave it watched-on mesmerized its visual splendor likability its characters . almost thirty years later panorama completely different . star wars movies still hold bar special effects but computer-generated world , amazing visuals ocurr within any television comercial , even lowest budget sci-fi television show special effects somewhat convincing or least cool look . effects not make movie " attack clones " more effects than story or even acting matter . awfully silly dialogue doesn't help it neither . retrospect , i wish george lucas would come up two completely different droids than c3po r2d2 ( latter even flies ! imagine , more capabilities than future ) . this premise even absurd world star wars . according story , luke skywalker his uncle owen episode four bought two droids thirty forty years old . i'm typing this review i imagine myself typing it royal ribbon typewriter , just wouldn't happen . it scary find things even too far-fetched world lucas created but movie full them . he doesn't really give any explanation whole trilogy ( i , ii , iii ) why future ships not cool or look act clunkier , or why everything looks dated thirty years now . his world technology goes backwards not other way around . i , however solution all these . george lucas should keep meddling original trilogy until all left original films faces protagonists . everything else should computer re-generated order keep pace future more sync its past . then , you could buy all versions original trilogy ( iv , , vi ) . originally shot , revised version we all saw re-release theaters , " ultimate enhanced version " better match second trilogy ( i , ii , iii ) . maybe he could even re-edited where actors look if they no personalities change dialog sound more confusing . then , you would whole set six films look fantastic but lack every other aspect story telling ( ie ., compelling characters , continuity , interesting plotlines , etc ) . only reason i give movie two stars because wonderful effects created ilm still makes film worth watching least once . otherwise , i rather watch " serenity " which more star wars feel it than this star wars film . nickname " mannequin " " annakin " well-deserved it any negatives regarding characters this poorly told story	1
what it 70 ... decade begged parodied -- almost while we still living it ? watching " seven ups " , just released dvd , its pretty obvious what so " strange " 70 . everything so extreme . clothing extreme ; poverty extreme ; automobiles extreme ; everything either " suede " or " broken glass " . all " schlock " 70 produced , there group incredible crime/cop films came out era . sort 70 " noir " . " seven ups " roy scheider plays leader " special squad " police dealing offenders whose crimes wil guarantee them prison sentence " 7 years or up " hence rather misleading title film . i hadn't seen this film over 25 years when i recently purchased it , watching it time capsule gritty urban 70 . what really surprised me , rewatching it , though , how much subsequent movie tv crime shows " ripped off " this film . that not say this film didn't its own larceny ... there car chase designed out-do " french connection " " bullitt " . but it plot character construction this film , some its contemporaries , set style shows 30 years later still emulating . its character driven ; plot driven ; action filled . watching this movie , i could almost smell diesel fumes transit buses i used ride downtown baltimore 1970s . watch it historical curiosity ; watch it parody ; but you'll also realize you're watching fine example tight story telling still influencing tony soprano his competition today	1
i saw dead ringers movies . theater filled mostly couples . when it over , we walked out , laughter began spread we all recognized we couples same conversation ; " whose stupid idea it pay money see this move " !	-1
this quite corny adventure film , one least significant movies hitchcock ever made . it deserves two stars maltin . yes , charles laughton good major villain , although his makeup could used some work times , especially during closeups . yes , 19-year-old maureen o'hara beautiful , even if her clothes never stay wet after swimming her makeup never gets smeared . yes , young robert newton okay , even if his commission bearing his police credentials remain dry clear after ocean . but whole , this melodrama one live without . young people especially guffaw hammy ending . worse problem print . it inferior . one point there jump eliminates five or ten minutes story . there no excuse putting this sort print dvd	1
made during horror movie heyday late 1930s early 1940s , this classic suspenseful thriller introduced audiences one most well-known movie monsters ; lon chaney jr. ' " wolf man " . chaney plays larry talbot , who returning his home wales after spending eighteen years united states . larry brother recently killed hunting accident . claude rains stars larry father , sir john talbot . upon returning home , larry helps his father install new lens his telescope . while peering through lens , larry discovers beautiful girl window across street . her name gwen conliffe ( evelyn ankers ) . larry goes over introduces himself , two agree go walk together evening . gwen invites her friend jenny williams come . three decide go their fortunes told group gypsies who set up camp town . jenny goes first . gypsy bela ( bela lugosi ) reads jenny fortune . he immediately disturbed when he sees shape pentagram appear jenny palm . he immediately tells jenny leave . meanwhile , gwen larry walked off their own . minutes later , they hear blood-curdling scream . larry runs investigate finds large wolf attacking jenny . larry manages kill wolf his silver-handled cane , but he bitten process . gypsy maleva ( maria ouspenskaya ) tells larry legend werewolf , if person bitten werewolf survives , they too become werewolf . maleva gives larry charm wear around his neck protect himself , but he gives charm gwen . night full moon , maleva predictions come true , larry talbot transformed into werewolf . charm protect gwen , or she suffer same fate her friend jenny ? this movie remained classic over sixty years , it takes viewer back time before blood-and-guts horror films popular , movie producers relied psychological terror scare audiences . there no blood this movie , but viewer still scared unique movie sets , fog rolling through trees , haunting musical score . lon chaney jr. made his role wolf man famous , he only actor ever played wolf man . although character originally designed boris karloff , chaney made this his signature role . he always remembered wolf man . other actors , especially maria ouspenskaya claude rains , give good performances well . i give this movie my highest recommendation . this film takes me back when i young child , i used stay up late weekends watching scary movies television . remember , " even man who pure heart says his prayers night , may become wolf when wolf bane blooms , autumn moon bright "	1
lovers foreign films find this movie gem . unlike most american offerings , foreign productions rely human relationships emotions drive plot rather than sterotypical situations characters . this film no exception . movie , which more family bonds time crisis then it homosexuality horror aids , candid enthralling beginning end . relationships family members touching , times inadvertently strange , especially if you're american family . love they one comes across very strong actions like cuddling while sleeping same bed incidental nudity among brothers ( things considered inappropriate other cultures ) not any way sexual but simply natural part family life . my opinion good movie allows you think bigger issues . while watching " close leo " i couldn't help but wonder how much stronger stable people , turn societies , would if most families like this . maybe cultures general too quick demonize think such activities suspect or improperly sexual . even family questionable decision keep plight marcel favorite brother secret made out concern compassion not selfishness or malice . climax film contains graphic sexuality nudity leo hostel keeper , but it very realistic poignant way . it here where audience able see how leo deep familial love enables him make final unselfish choice . deciding change his previous wanton behavior send marcel back home alone paris , he makes decision take possession his own pain over his death refuse allow anyone family take it upon themselves . definitely " must see " if you get opportunity	1

" body soul " elevated conspicuous morality tale classic film virtue its supporting cast . william conrad terrific gruff , two-faced , but somehow sympathetic quinn , even though he few lines . charley gold digging mistress , alice , even less prominent character , played memorably hazel brooks . charley fianc�e beloved peg , art student aspiring painter played lilli palmer , odd character . she intelligent , articulate , temperate -in contrast charley . but her european accent refined demeanor make her seem out place film lower east side . somehow , this works film favor putting peg moral pedestal .

late `70s early `80s walter hill one best action/thriller directors . like don siegel sam peckinpah before him , hill made lean , gritty no-nonsense genre pictures like warriors , southern comfort 48hrs . he understands what drives action film visual storytelling through kinetic editing . this what propels his under-appreciated movie , driver finally seeing its debut dvd . near dialogue-less opening heist/getaway sequence foreshadows same kind approach michael mann would later apply his own urban crime thrillers , most notably , thief , which owes huge debt driver terms style attitude . first car chase , where driver evades several police cars through city streets night epitome stylistic economy . there no cgi , no special effects ; just judicious use editing letting action tell story . hill employs classic , no frills style filmmaking almost non-existent today climate which all music video style editing ( which he dabbled streets fire ) . he doesn't feel need spell things out through dialogue or providing unnecessary back stories . it not important where this guy came or we even like him . this movie battle wills driver detective . there three-minute " alternate beginning " which establishes , early , detective work philosophy also two women driver life . this prologue originally aired television . also included theatrical trailer . sadly , fox not included 135 minute version shown los angeles american cinemateque , which apparently included more car chases	1

this horrible movie no redeeming value . i realize such knock actually drive people purchase this . let me bring something you attention . this slasher movie effective gore . fact , time , gore more sick similar movies . however , there no scares , no suspense , no clever script , no story it stupic ending . i know , applies most gore movies ! problem this movie it overly mean spirited towards women ( i am man , 6 foot 235 pound big strong guy also raises family ) . story , which guy killing women b/c mistreatment his mother , seems like it written directed person shares same demons killer film . murders this movie so mean-spirited ( yet no cinematic value ) normal movie goer would offended . this movie not sick " good " movie way but rather sick ashamed manner . this woman-bashing movie should make any viewer feel guilty they patronizing this garbage . movie should entertainment value . there no cinematic , artistic touch this film . this simply mean , mean movie !	-1

i think there weird kind disconnect modern audiences when they watch silent film , despite fact carl theodor dreyer vampyre fact " talkie " , i don't think any movie could illustrate point better . sound motion pictures new enough when this film made film-makers clearly adjusting idea . dialogue minimal , sound effects sparse enough jarring , most movie plays like some victorian goth kid fever dream . combination minimal sound beautiful atmospheric visuals make something very unique unsettling . definitely worth watching . hard-core vampire fans should warned : despire title , this movie more haunted house story than vampire story . if you're dying vintage bloodsucking , you should probably check out other 1931 vamipre movie . you know , one starring romanian guy seasme street	1

fan nick park style claymation , i gave this product four stars . but second season creature comforts not universally accessible first . starters , there greater use harder understand british accents ( yorkshire , urban youth talk , heavy scottish , etc ) , which fine bbc afficiandos such myself , but others , especially children , may find it bit difficult sort through sounds hear what interviewees saying . keeping mind this series made uk , references pop culture side ocean may more obscure humor more elusive neophytes . material well seems bit mature younger audiences . parents may wish screen episodes before watching them their children . it strictly pg+ , not quite racy enough pg13 , but bit more advanced than some may feel comfortable ( think juicier bits " rabbit " ) . but quality animation remains strong . little details which we all love - background characters moving response what interviewees saying - up standard excellence which we expect ardman product . humor still there , enjoyable those who appreciate british style wit . previously noted , this set contains separately sold christmas special - which very fun episode , indeed , but not worth buying twice . so , if you're nick park fan , this you . but newbie may put off difficult accents unfamiliar subjects	1

o.k. , except old farts who don't like profanity , wheezer who only thought 20 minutes it entertaining chick who thought intro lame ( bill murry send-up reservation theme genius ) , this very funny dvd . there definitely some lame moments ( david spade trying too hard `cooler than everyone else room ' shtick ) , some painful moments ( adam sandler piece embarrassingly horrible ) yet one more intensely boring musical piece lately ubiquitous prince , whose own shtick sexual ambivalence , wimpy voice imminently forgettable tunes only rival his/her movie exploits tedium . anyhow , although i think madtv folks occasionally find finer honed edge than snl crowd ( first two seasons consistently funnier ) , they also taped would hard time doing it live consistent basis . like ebb flow sun-spot activity , snl good bad casts , strong weak seasons , but always something going makes it worth while watching , almost always pulls off one immensely funny skit during evening . this collection those efforts . don't miss it . i just wish they would release 15th anniversary taping . it hilarious .	1

geez .... way back then , i absolutely loved alice . thirty years later it all looks so immature ridiculous . his theatrical broadway antics just look wimpy . i still think alice probably pretty cool guy , i love hearing his older music ( killer still his best album ) , but this dvd really sucks . it probably deserves 1 star , but i can't bear give alice failing grade , so out kindness my heart , i'll give him 2 stars . stay away this dvd . oh yeah ...... they promote this dvd extra shocking gross ........ it not , compared today standards . this whole disc just seems silly	1
child i pen pals one swarm stars : christian juttner . christian came up through disney farm team system ( creating child actors ) . he only good thing this miserable dreck . don't get me wrong - he over acting , but he isn't chewing up scenery like so many others this long , drawn out pot boiler/action film . irwin allen produced swarm . he also created " towering inferno , " " earthquake , " " posiedon adventure " among vast list low grade science fiction/action television series . allen used formula each his films/television series . he doesn't stray it here . michael caine his most painfully horrible , overacting so badly he verges manic personality . olivia dehaviland embarrasses herself god-awful southern accent overacts so badly she seems doing skit impression herself acting class how not act . fred mcmurray saddled dismal dialogue but doesn't actually embarrass himself . allen throws us bevy a-list actors silver screen era , only squander waste them . script absolutely painfully bad . nothing quite makes sense ( not this silliness could ever really make sense . apparently , swarms african killer bees sitting around procreating mustering up nerve declare war all texas ( although only idiot would not realize sets used hollywood hills backlots everywhere hollywood ) . what if these swarms get together create one huge swarm ? what indeed ?! opening film : large group men orange mechanics overalls orange motorcycle helmets wander around military facility without uttering word - this takes place over twenty minutes . apparently we understand these boys orange scientists military personnel assigned investigate disaster : military installation decimated something .... but what ? lab quite obviously allen television series : 20000 leagues under sea lost space . when they speak , you wish they just shut up instead uttering such drivel . now , we believe these bees kill quickly efficiently leaving no tell tale signs what killed victims . first all there would huge welts victims secondly there would some dead bees ( they tell us they've only discovered one bee carcass - i got news you - if i'm getting stung swarm bees , i'm still going get few good slaps take out more than zero bees ) . christian juttner character part first onscreen attack . his parents killed they set up picnic ( thank heavens , because neither them act)- juttner mercifully spared because he sent car thermos ... he drives car(covered bees ) into backlot ... um , i mean nearby town whisked off hospital treatment his bites . he later sneaks out some friends antagonizes swarm bees picnic area where his parents died . then he runs around talking michael caine promises watch over some woman caine taken liking . next we see juttner bed hospital sick , dying , dead ! wow ! where this come ? dehavilland agonizes only high school freshman acting student would over deaths dozens school children playground ( however never we actually see bee any these kids ) . no where film we see any indication bees actually stung any victims . there no welts , no marks , no redness . they're just .... dead .

warner brothers commended assembling this triple feature set classic randolph scott films single two-sided dvd . although this not scott best work -- look " 7 men now " or " ride high country " -- these b-westerns very , very entertaining not missed any fan westerns or good stories . early 1950s technicolor looks great transfers appear made very good source materials . i only wish wb would made least bare bones scene selection menu and/or added trailers these other scott films . also , anamorphically enhanced transfers would nice considering current proliferation 16x9 monitors . i shied away buying this disc initially because these indeed b-movies not scott best work but i found them very , very enjoyable westerns . so much so i'm ordering other wb set scott westerns . sit back , relax allow yourself watch randolph scott ride again !

alfred hitchcock my favorite director ! it impossible me pick favorite film there too many i love cannot live without . however , one i seem come back more so than others " rope " . plot ( based off leopold/loeb murder 1924 ) pure hitchcock . two grad students/roommates strangle fellow student hide his body inside trunk . trunk then covered tablecloth , candles food used party entertain ( who else ) victim family friends . i love fact this first movie shot real time . hitch makes his cuts every ten minutes ( length film camera could hold 1948 ) closing out character back , trunk or wall . thing i always pay attention how fake backdrop outside large livingroom window looks amazingly real film carries sun sets . kudos property master lighting department ! hitchcock also loved anything taboo perverse . he went great lengths let us know these two roommates not only killers but they lovers well ! overtones unmistakeable i can't believe it got past censors . john dall farley granger play it up nines ! i won't spoil ending or tell you why two men decided murder their victim first place . i tell you this definitely hitchcock first masterpiece ! pure suspense ! go buy or rent it right now ! you won't sorry	1
why ? because if you're here , you probably already saw movie just curious this release version . so i'll tell you it . first , good : - comes official movie soundtrack . i mean full soundtrack , it separate disc . - video transfer lot better than original dvd release . - case designed lot more appealing than standard black blue . - audio better encoded easier hear lower volumes . - lots extras , including some fluff , but hey . - better aspect ratio , picture fills widescreen displays more evenly without stretching . now , bad : - soundtrack ... it so irritating listen , because they managed true movie version " nothing but love " some other songs , fresh movie , but yet " nights like this " after 7 version . i don't mind after 7 version , it not bad , but i wanted hear movie version . this especially troublesome when they even managed byrd song fresh movie . - some footage never made it movie should . like scene where duck explaining all members sing all different levels . it would explain later scene when choirboy offers sing eddie place - when i watched first version i confused . soprano singing baritone parts ? also , there some slight comedy pieces there should included . - some extras just flat out pointless - or if they wanted include them least include characters people cared . there one extra where actors kayfabe giving their thoughts before accepting ' awards ' . totally corny , but it might entertaining if eddie kang jr. jt there . there only 3 five present . - general movie negative ... they never explain what happened bobby , beginning movie . i hoping deleted scene would explain this , but alas ... so , would i recommend getting this ? absolutely , because i almost guarantee it won't released hd-dvd or bluray	1

d.o.a. ( 1950 ) one those films i try watch once year ( lot easier since purchasing it dvd ) it classic american film-noir mystery/drama quite bit going it , few , minor flaws ( minor flaws tend stand out little more here because most other aspects so strong ) . directed rudolph mat� ( when worlds collide , violent men ) , accomplished cinematographer prior moving into realm directing , feature stars oscar winning character actor edmond o'brien ( hitch-hiker , barefoot contessa , wild bunch ) . also appearing pamela britton ( " blondie " , " my favorite martian " ) , lynn baggett ( time their lives ) , luther adler ( voyage damned ) , beverly garland ( alligator people ) , william ching ( lonely place ) , laurette luez ( prehistoric women ) , neville brand ( halls montezuma , stalag 17 ) , his first credited feature film role . fans television show " green acres " , keep eye peeled frank `sam drucker ' cady , he got bit part early bartender . film opens we see man entering large , metropolitan police station head towards homicide division . upon arriving , we learn he there report murder ... his own ! turns out man name frank bigelow ( o'brien ) , he accountant small , californian town , which we move into lengthy flashback he relates his tale . frank works small , podunk town secretary/girlfriend paula ( britton ) , it seems paula little put out fact frank announced , very short notice , he taking trip san francisco get little time himself . frank arrives his hotel , joint jumping conventioneers , group them frank ends up hooking up ... after night out town frank returns hotel wakes next morning feeling rather poorly , enough so cause him see doctor , which he then informed he poisoned ! not only , but poison fatal , he got perhaps week , most , live . some vacation ... anyway , frank eventually discovers his predicament deliberately caused , sets out discover whos whys . trail leads frank minor business dealing he some time ago character named renoylds , one involving sale some precious metals . frank delves deeper into mystery he stirs up hornet nest trouble , mainly himself , there those who don't appreciate his sudden interest their affairs , runs afoul some thugs , result if poison coursing through his system doesn't kill him , various bullets thrown his way might ... i think one more interesting aspects this film me how o ' brien character just wasn't entirely likeable fellow beginning , one i found myself rooting end ( albeit halfheartedly ) . you see , scenes near beginning , frank portrayed sort philanderer , especially once he hits san francisco . , itself wouldn't mean much me , except fact he stringing swell dame paula ( ms. britton looked incredibly beautiful here , but not inaccessible ) who completely devoted him , so much so she willing put up his peccadilloes . sure she gets miffed , but she always ends up coming around , , one point , she basically tells frank there isn't anything he would cause her feelings him falter ... probably not something you should relate someone wandering eye . once frank accepts his predicament ( whole dying thing ) , he eventually come around , realizing what important , so there strong , moral element involved . element i enjoyed character chester thug , played neville brand , who appears later story . it always fun when they throw sadistic , wild-eyed psychotic mix , especially one who tends refer himself third person call his handgun `baby ' . there couple really great lines dialogue present , one which i used title this review . it occurs once frank begins unraveling mystery his murder , he gets terse femme fatale whom he believes involved ( she ) , which she tells him " if you man i'd punch your dirty face . " . good one comes just prior this , he strong arming tight-lipped secretary , played beverly garland , into spilling her guts telling her she " this right up your pretty , little neck ! " . i thought performances , direction , writing , cinematography all very strong , complimented wonderfully dimitri tiomkin vibrant musical score . pacing quick leads up exciting engaging climax , one definitely worth sticking around ... there one aspect i find annoying , it wasn't fact so many fabulous babes seemed willing throw themselves slightly paunchy edmond o'brien . it involved usage slide whistle . o'brien character arrives his hotel san francisco early , every time he sees babe there simulated wolf call sound effect created slide whistle . now this something i'd expect screwball comedy starring jerry lewis , but not something fits material here , especially given rather dramatic opening sequence . i'm unsure who decided throw particular sound effect , but they didn't picture any favors . it certainly doesn't ruin film , but i thought i should warn those interesting see it , it may draw you out feature it me , eliciting " what fudge ? " response . despite minor point , rest gold , especially if you're fan noir . it looks if this film release onto dvd various times , few , different companies , but version i own released image entertainment , part wade williams collection . dvd case states source material used restored producer negative . picture , presented full screen ( 1.33 : 1 ) look clean sharp , but there minor imperfection throughout ( no frames seem missing , though ) . far dolby digital mono audio , it seemed me levels weren't entirely consistent , i found myself regularly adjusting volume ( maybe my ears going bad , i don't know ) . there aren't any extras included , but there chapter stops . i haven't seen other dvd releases so i can't compare this them , but i'm familiar enough image entertainment dvd releases feel comfortable saying overall quality here probably better than some less expensive releases . i notice roan release available , i've found their releases solid , so if your looking less expensive version but still better than average quality , might way go . cookieman108by way , i've seen 1988 remake featuring dennis quaid meg ryan ... it not bad , but comes up lacking when compared original , my opinion .	1
this movie decent movie lot gore but plot weak acting horrible . kim myers good actor but she not fit this roll like she bloodline . freddy still psycotic killer but he changed into more jokester which really killing series . also mark patton character whines cries through out movie like little baby it really kills movie . this movie just hardcore fans or people collecting entire series . this only gets two stars because violence gore .	1
perhaps i love this movie so much simply beacuse i just now happened upon it . i hadn't heard it , now i see it came out 2002 . wow , where i ? this one twisted chick one twisted film . thing obviously attracts us female character her beauty , brains . no one could this evil still men chasing her without " something . " " something " she sexy -- real knock-out . scene bar where she checks out berg equipment under table can't beat . sort outdoing " sally met harry " 2002 . berg plays it cool , great " secret " his life finally revealed toward end movie . if you enjoy movies where you don't know how things going turn out , check out last seduction it fill all your needs	1
i getting tired watching this movie probably because i didn't really like charactor franklin he just getting my nerves he just felt like bagage girl friend ( i forget charactors name ) i got mad when franklin wasn't doing his part relationship , even if he couldn't get job , he could least helped out baby more so mother child didn't lose out her dream becoming singer . perhaps if she didn't meet him she might made it . all fairness franklin there times when girlfriend provoked franklin insecurities . example when he brought tickets concert them her birthday she traded them better seats . thats no no you don't take gift back front person who brought you gift , would hurt anybody make them feel unappreciated . all all i thought it somewhat realistic story relationship man woman trying keep it togetherarguments breakup all . ending kind leaves you hanging but you assume they try get back together	1

glass cage piece work should not overlooked . when i saw film apt pupil , i thought it decent film some superb acting , but sadly i felt hollywood watered movie down when it came portraying nazi mentality , decadence , cycle abuse , cruelty . after viewing glass cage , i finally seen what other film could become if it not hollywood politics , since then i kept ever closer eye foreign cinema . glass cage both tale mental decay revenge . this story revolves around german family relocated isolation spain after fall 3rd reich , young man(angelo ) , who child abused patriarch family , klaus ; former ss officer . angelo tracked klaus down , catches him committing brutal act against youth . klaus ' brutal act sends klaus over mental edge , fit despair , he makes failed suicide bid , confining him iron lung glass windows(the glass cage ) . angelo , gathered some sensitive journals depicting klaus ' crimes , uses this his past klaus coerce klaus into allowing angelo into household " care " paralyzed helpless klaus . angelo quickly begins corrupting family , gaining daughter affections simultaneously gaining abhorance family matriarch , while keeping klaus edge making him relive atrocities he tried escape . first angelo this through reading journals atrocities klaus , eventually angelo descends deeper into madness , begins committing atrocities his own . starting matriarch house , angelo begins kill , he quickly moves children like described journals he reads . torture klaus who both adores despises himself very things he now forced watch come full circle . his wife dead , his daughter controlled angelo , he forced relive himself . this where uncompromising nature piece really takes hold . children put death this film , viewer not spared agony this implications , or off-camera violence . this happens your face , even very first scene klaus youth . it places bitter slice nazi cruelty right your mouth you taste . eventually this cruelty aimed klaus himself , eerie aid daughter , mental schism becomes complete , angelo assuming role klaus glass cage . i found this film more dramatic shocker than art-house film , but story solid acting top notch , especially when approaching subject matter . glass cage not shock simply degrade viewer , rather presents violencce " this how it went down " fashion . nothing glamorized no character particularly likeable , they simply they programmed better or worse , which right point context naziism . if visually-presented subject nazi cruelty regarding homosexuality , petiphilia , grotesque murder children would get you leave room , then this film not you . but those you seeking uncompromising cinema ...	1
2-disc , director cut , my expectations perhaps too high this dvd . nevertheless , i appalled poor quality transfer . colors dull throughout , focus frequently not beginning scenes . movie itself , i don't agree it holding up well over time . 25 years old , movie just limited entertainment value people who aren't waiting their beloved canceled tv series big screen . there no question ii iv best series , but comparing it other star trek original cast movies isn't putting bar very high . my interest watching this again just finished melville moby dick , final scenes which khan repeats liberally during final space battle . said , i think montalban fantastic revenged-obsessed khan very evocative ahab . however , shatner pretentious kirk just becomes more grating time goes . original cast schtick just doesn't make compelling drama	1

quiet deliberate movie ultimately suffers too much star power . no matter how scruffy wain filmmakers try make nicole kidman look , she still nicole kidman . her portrayal janitor really pushes limits " suspension disbelief " her delicate features legs go forever . anthony hopkins also miscast jewish professor hard knock , secret past . while he remains one my favorite actors , he cannot escape his " britishness " which even more unbelievable once you discover what his character past ! real discovery this film wentworth miller absolutely astonishing turn teenage anthony hopkins . ultimately , film worth seeing wentworth miller alone . but casting two megawatt hollywood actors hurts believability this film end	1
you like zombie movies ? course you , otherwise you wouldn't here . but you like piss-poor make-up design , god-awful special effects horrendous lighting ? probably no t.t he best thing i say this flick it comes 2 discs . first ( plaga zombie)is almost certainly college project . ( so i won't comment further one . but second disc ( plaga zombie : mutant zone ) should better since it follow-up bigger ( i assume ) budget . anyways ; music little over-exaggerated seemed like it trying make this flick more serious than it really . ( except " john west " song , which i still find myself singing . fact whole scene best part movie . ) when it comes zombie comedies , you alot better than this one . ( ie : dead-alive , return living dead part 2 , shaun dead ) don't get me wrong , directors potential . but potential would better geared toward slap-stick comedies , not horror comedies . just side note : main attraction any zombie flick undeads prosthetic make-up . ( peeling flesh/half-eaten lips/severed limbs disembodied torsos/ etc . ) suffice say , absolutely none these zombies even so much resembled zombies . ( or acted like zombies matter ) . they look more like college kids after halloween night . moral story : time money precious commodities . waste them this flick unethical .	-1

this movie just wonderful . first movie great movie well , but i believe this better . i understand many people felt differently . but when you look 2001 version it just plain better . overall . acting , effects , story-line . 1971 version , well 70s . they best they could what they . but this version concentrates more friendship two athletes well family chicago bears provided it players since it beginnings 1920 . pfeifer maher performances wonderful ! coach halas played excellently too ! huge chicago bears fan chicago bears history buff , i'd say this movie almost perfect . oh your tissues ready almost this whole movie because it sadder than first . granted stories same , but they focus more illness not race issue . i believe more important this story than anything else .	1
i am really picky critical what i watch , but i consider wire season 1 masterpiece . give you idea my tastes , one my favorite movies insomnia al pacino . this show even better than , you get enjoy it whole season , not just 2 hours ! everything rings true . dialogue , plot -- everything . plot dialogue remind me movie crash times , only this less over-the-top . it lots philosophical symbolism , but unlike crash it presented subtly rather than beating you over head it . suspenseful moments most suspenseful i've seen anything screen . because it serial , there time complex plot complex characters developed . you get hear bona fide dialect spoken many african-americans dc-baltimore area where i live , vocabulary not dumbed down general audience you would find most movies . you get real thing . lastly , director something i wish more directors would : he dispenses music most part . many directors use music crutch making audience feel emotions they supposed feel particular scene . here , emotional reactions induced good acting alone , it works . watch this show . you won't regret it	1

this sequel viewers sidestitches laughing their heads off ! regina hall anna faris return play their hilarious characters wayans brothers bring laughs two fold . if you into classic horror movies than this best movie ! there ia lot more tongue cheek moments crude sometimes political humor . now lot people bag tori spelling but i thought she hilarious this movie . watching classics such " exorcist " , " haunting " " house haunted hill " mercilessly spoofed make this purchase worth it . this may not funny people enjoy slasher flicks but those enjoy classics , then this movie ! however i'd warn against eating or drinking while watching this movie unless viewer doesn't mind spewing said items out their nose	1
rabbitproof fence based true story three young aboriginal girls who ran away government relocation program 1930 australia . " half-caste " ( half-white ) aboriginal children forcibly removed their parents government , placed schools taught white way life , placed white families . many children never saw their parents again . against such tragic backdrop , rabbitproof fence impossibly exhilarating , not because happy ending , but just because someone tried fight racist program against impossible odds . three young girls seek walk fifteen hundred miles back their family , they chased trackers . extras - making-of documentary film commentary director truly enhance film make it experience you never forget , not entertainment few hours . highly , highly recommended	1

this series bawdy tongue cheek way totally not pc , i think what makes watching it so much fun . mike hammer old school private eye living digital era , but least he still solve crimes catch " bad guys " . it campy full puns , if you enjoy blood elaborate chase scenes this not you . but if you just want chuckle don't take things you see television shows seriously this could choice you . never saw original however .	1

although not my favorite jim carrey movie , me , myself irene moments pure hilarity . i'm big fan carrey i'm also nice person who stepped one too many times my life . so when charlie ( carrey ) finally snaps grocery store , i feel like i relate only wish i nerve act like his alter-ego , hank , who soon starts taking over . much like me , charlie wasn't always this way . he got married his wife wound up affair black midget limo driver their wedding day . she triplets although it quite obvious charlie not father , he embraces them anyway . then , she leaves him boys . that when charlie starts chipping away . he buries all his anger sadness inside until lo behold , he cannot take it anymore . his first outburst far my favorite . his fellow troopers rhode island force worried him he now take pills keep hank coming out . his boss gives him time off asks him drop off woman named irene upstate new york . epa wants talk her her involvement golf course scam , but irene doesn't know anything it ... her ex before she figure it out , he got everyone coming her . when his guys kill agents charlie left her , irene runs get charlie 2 must leave immediately . course , they hit road , charlie forgets bring his pills soon , irene gets meet hank . but " 3 " them ( charlie , hank irene ) survive lam ? ah , it certainly not carrey best film , but if you're fan , you'll certainly laugh out loud wonderful time . he really great job . if you mute movie , you still clearly tell when he charlie or hank . me , myself irene fun funny , if you've ever felt like you one second away snapping yourself , this one definitely you . enjoy	1
i didn't want start my review this way but , once while there comes movie extraordinary vision independence it must set apart others paradigm follow . pan labyrinth just such movie . far best work fantasy genre come out i'd say since legend . this movie not copy paste version novel little men , nor it poorly adapted screenplay novel written 15 year old . this movie delves deep into nature fantasy itself . what more fantastic than what within human mind ? possibilities , both wonderful horrific , endless . poor little ofelia our guide through human psyche we revel her wonderful fantasies revolted viscious clarity her reality . elements all classic fairytales interspersed within , carefully woven together form new unique tale . some say this movie brutality war , child imagination escapist fancy . i disagree . though movie set time revolution there few , stress few , graphically violent scenes , movie this sharp contrasts hazy , beautiful fantasy scenes . focus more emotion unimaginative reality life . ofelia encounters many monsters , both real mythical , worst captain , her stepfather . this serves strengthen fact some people lives worse than anything we imagine . far cinematography goes , movie shot perfectly . reality dark gritty , dirty yet vividly clear . ofelia fantasy world moments clarity , but overall hazy , like memory sunny summer day long , long ago . mood captured perfectly really brings viewer into picture . soundtrack subtle , enabling viewer visually astounded , yet powerful enough it startle you out your dream when you least expect it . one my favorite things movie narration . narrator voice melodic deep . when narration starts , it just fits so perfectly you couldn't imagine movie without it . watching this movie spanish real treat , even if you don't speak language . so much feeling context gained watching it natural language it completely negates any bad things subtitles . overall , huge recommendation anyone who tired boring , unimaginative complacent productions hollywood . this stimulate mind leave you sad but same time happy	1
movie such this , i pleasantly surprised realistic qualities it held . first i skeptical david duchovny talk over if he doing narritive . really wasn't what it though . it just exerpts things he putting tape later use . once i got my head , movie started flowing pretty nicely . brad pitt excellent job role he played white trash killer who really doesn't understand what he doing even though he knows fact he killed . absolutely no remorse . usual , juliette lewis plays dumb innocent girl astounding accuaracy . either she really good actress she just typecasted , or she just dumb they hire her those types roles just reason . this movie overall great anyone who likes take peek life serial killer . even though it based fiction , brad pitt such good job sticking role gave movie realistic quality . check it out if you into those types movies	1
i really enjoyed this movie . i thought story excellent . i expected frankenstein your classic , everyday , lame horror film which you only watch get some cheap thrills , see some horrible overacting . i didn't find it so all . this movie beautifully - powerful , dynamic story how man attempts achieve greatness , but ends up ruining their lives lives others result . i not read mary shelley book , but if it half emotional effect this movie , i'll consider it time well spent ! kenneth branagh brought this movie together wonderfully , both his directing powerful , memorable acting tormented dr. victor frankenstein . this film quite simply spectacular ! it goes same category hell , they both too sophisticated beautiful just horror films . cleverness this film its sheer radiance must throw some people off . robert de niro creature ! de niro gives foul beast soul his own . well worth look , photography alone makes it worth owning dvd .	1

my second favorite three darin/dee comedies , last one they filmed . obviously not shakespear , but cute premise good supporting cast , great chemistry two leads . esp good donald o'connor , one darin real life heros . it great see them work together . it also demonstrates darin considerable songwriting talent peaked when he commissioned write song specific context , occured many his movies . resulting theme song here , funny feeling , really wonderful infectious . recommended fans darin , dee , or just fans goofy romantic comedies general .	1

tos finally comes end we get volume worthy trek lore . mediocre 3rd season me praying someone put this puppy out its misery but least we get two episodes , second which even more so , worthy inclusion among very best episodes across all 3 seasons here . first episode little silly times but huge redeeming factor me introduction explanation very key characters pivotal future trek series like ds9 e.g. kahless founding father vulcans . also , moral pursuit science knowledge noble worthy causes themselves but not cost misery suffering innocent others i found very relevant even today . second episode one my all-time favourites i even liked it better than " city ... forever . " just episode , there number inconsistencies strange events here like how completely different planet similar history ours musketeers boot ! ignoring this though , side-story spock mccoy simply brilliant . nimoy very good acting job here he shows emotions jealousy anger then reverts his usual self end . very good time-travel episode very easily best episode final season . if you deciding which volumes keep , this one falls under " must " category . recommended	1
following up their success 1974 uptown saturday night , sidney poitier ( raisin sun , guess who coming dinner ) bill cosby ( " i spy " , california suite ) paired up again this film aptly titled let it again ( 1975 ) , which followed their third outing titled piece action ( 1977 ) . directed poitier , let it again featured particularly strong supporting cast calvin lockhart ( uptown saturday night ) , john amos ( " good times " , die hard 2 ) , ossie davis ( right thing ) , denise nicholas ( piece action ) , lee chamberlin ( " electric company " ) , julius harris ( live let die ) , mel stewart ( hammer , trick baby ) , jimmie walker , who top world time his role character james ' . . ' evans , jr hit television series " good times " , his first silver screen appearance . also , keep eye out former heavyweight boxing champion george foreman , sans his foreman grill , jayne kennedy ( muthers ) , former miss ohio one first women land nfl announcing gig , bit parts near beginning ( miss kennedy `legs ' scenes worth watching more than once ) . poitier cosby play couple atlanta working class stiffs clyde williams billy foster , respectively , both who members lodge need new home , city planning tearing down their current location . lodge raised some monies , but not nearly enough fund new building , but billy plan ... one involves clyde using his ability hypnotize . men , their wives , played nicholas chamberlin , leave atlanta weekend getaway new orleans ( billy his wife celebrating their anniversary ) , lodge money hand , intent taking funds betting extreme underdog bootney farnsworth ( walker ) , upcoming boxing match . it sucker bet sure , one local big time criminals kansas city mack ( amos ) biggie smalls ( lockhart ) only too happy take , until they lose because clyde put whammy bootney , making him believe he greatest fighter there ever ... after bootney slaughters his opponent , clyde billy collect winnings , remove whammy bootney , return home , but kansas city mack figures out what happened , finds boys , now wants put them work fixing fight not only get his money back , but also put his rival , smalls , out business same time . boys little choice but participate mack scheme , but they develop their own double-cross , one score their lodge funds necessary new nursery while getting both kansas city mack biggie smalls off their backs good , if things go planned , that big if ... three films poitier cosby together early mid 1970s , this one probably my favorite , uptown saturday night ( 1974 ) piece action ( 1977 ) coming close second third , respectively ... regardless , all three films just whole lot fun , poitier cosby played off so well against each other , assisted wonderful supporting cast each time . what so interesting these movies they originally presented alternative black audiences cinema , time , inundated blaxpoitation films , but ended up appealing wide range audiences due fact they just so entertaining . perhaps funniest bit this film , besides cosby character flashy wardrobe when he disguised his underworld alter ego mongo slade , sequence after jimmy walker character hypnotized confidence up waz . after knocking put his sparring partner , bootney subsequently tears up gym , knocking punching bag through wall speed bag out window amazement everyone ( most all his trainer ) attendance . some aspects feature terribly dated , i.e. wardrobe sported some characters , gangsters seemed particularly goofy ( i found it difficult believe times kansas city mack or biggie smalls could hold down large , criminal operations due ineptness themselves their respective crews ) , but this all good natured fun , so we weren't meant take any it too seriously . cosby character just whole lot fun watch , whether he sticking script , or improvising his own bits . aspect really helped make this film soundtrack legendary curtis mayfield , featuring staple singers their smooth tune " let it again " . his best work , my opinion , 1972 film superfly , but his efforts here certainly outstanding . i think feature ran bit long ( pushing two hour mark ) , poitier could shaved ten minutes off still strong film , but he keep things moving well . story get slightly convoluted during latter half feature poitier cosby characters get their wives involved effort not only score some much needed funds , but also shake criminals off their tails , but given this comedy , more outlandish situations better . perhaps it also important note characters within three films , while very similar , not same so films followed uptown saturday night aren't sequels , but basically follow ups . if you're looking some lighthearted fun featuring some crazy characters even crazier situations , then i'd recommend checking out this film , uptown saturday night ( 1974 ) piece action ( 1977 ) , all certainly fit bill ( again , since let it again piece action aren't actually sequels , order which they're seen doesn't really matter ) . picture , provided anamorphic widescreen ( 1.85 : 1 ) , looks sharp dolby digital mono audio comes through clean . only extras included dvd subtitles ( available english , spanish , french ) , feature length commentary track screenwriter richard wesley new york press film critic armond white . too bad warner couldn't pull together some principal players commentary track i would really enjoyed hearing both but poitier cosby comment their film , but oh well ... cookieman108	1

despite my revulsion using such phrase , best summation i give this work " fair balanced . " director rodger young somehow manages present view escalating situation idaho not tainted , slanted , or driven politically correct agenda . there no bad guys no good guys this docudrama . ( although i might stretch point name " bad guy " deputy director stagg , supervisory us marshal who , upon seeing weaver name front page newspaper , demands stakes raised armed tactical units brought . this particular character gets all 30 seconds ' screen time , but i think it far say , if stagg ego hadn't so badly bruised thought weaver not arrested 18 months , situation could stayed under control . ) working script lionel chetwind , which developed book " every knee shall bow " jess walter , young frankly amazing job portraying weavers ' early life together , dropping hints racism , separatism , some decidedly unorthodox religious viewpoints way -- but none it condemning manner . yes , vicki randy almost certainly not sort folks you'd want associate much , but all character flaws , nothing justifies what their situation came . truth , triumphant scene which family finally " discovers " spot land become their home should end story . i've always something laura dern fan , but my admiration this actress talent professionalism definitely raised couple notches her portrayal vicki . you see her eyes fervent belief complete assurances , while perhaps misguided , certainly not out cause trouble or violence -- indeed , end it vicki who asks randy stop associating skinheads , he more than happy so , clearly not very comfortable association all . disintegrating lines communication vicki rest her family especially well performed particularly hard watch . quaid , he manages deliver soul truly conflicted man , even behind exhausted eyes someone who finds himself number-one subject discussion across america when all he truly ever wanted left alone raise his family . bradley pierce puts across absorbing combination childhood innocence hard-hearted bigotry into role 14 year-old sammy weaver , who , together jacob davis younger version sammy , turn character into audience favorite time marshals open fire . it when family starts associating area neo-nazis aryan nations members kirsten dunst really starts shine story , absorbing hateful propaganda neatly tying it into religious views which her mother diligently raised her . end result both compelling disturbing . darren burrows also delivers first-rate performance weaver family friend kevin harris , who manages anchor weaver reality even he lies bleeding delirious . particularly compelling performance brought life bruce locke , who plays fbi sniper lon horiuchi , who killed vicki even she held her baby . locke injects sense anger naked revenge into eyes sniper -- this man who chosen interpret already badly-explained revised rules engagement himself , all he think getting even evil bastards who killed us marshal william degan . also worth look joe don baker legal living legend gerry spence " silkwood " notoriety , who manages switch some desperately-welcomed humorous moments movie coda . few points trivia : works hal lindsey ( " late great planet earth " ) referenced early story catalyst shaping vicki weaver beliefs . longtime independent journalist . orlin grabbe , one first publicly denounce fbi domestic terrorists , appears extra several scenes . short , movie not flinch : weaver loving dad devoted husband , but also bigot petty thief . feds framed him , botched case , overstepped their authority . there no excuses . nobody comes out this story completely innocent not single tenet hollywood-style political correctness observed . no single scene truly emerges pivotal " here where it all went wrong " moment . gary graham performance reluctant us marshal particularly convincing -- here law enforcement figure obviously doesn't want follow up this case would happily let him , but orders he getting above . movie takes us one sequence bad decisions next , ultimately revealing real " villain " piece miscommunication . marshals aren't listening local residents , weaver not listening his neighbors , vicki isn't listening her parents ( nor they listening her ) , press isn't listening marshals , us attorney isn't listening atf case agent , course fbi isn't listening anyone . it only end action when bo gritz ( excellently played bob gunton ) delivers horrifying news agitated crowd " villain " reveals itself -- one deft move , gritz defuses miscommunication , states simple truth , even calms down unruly ready-for-blood mob . federal government learn its lesson tragedy ruby ridge ? well , course . you just imagine internal memos flying around : " next time , punch holes walls tanks , flood place flammable gas , then shoot anyone who tries escape fire . " hats off hollywood this effort , particularly quaid , dern , young delivering product tells story without apology never slants audience sympathies too far one side or other . clear warning trumpet very much worth renting or owning , regardless your religious views , or where you think you fall political spectrum	1
whole " women prison " drama where they sexual realtionships quite nauseating watch . i guess it becasue i've worked prisons this kind show so ridiculous , usa male version ( oz or prison break ) . least male prison shows , there agenda escape , or some attempt everyday life prison ; whereas this show depicting healthy relationships . what makes this show more ridiculous love affairs women . not there aren't those female facilities . they just aren't like how they depcited this show . they create these soap box love stories don't ring true . more than likely affairs women prison manipulative , controlling , always volatile , never romantic . there usally so much dysfunction chaos created around female inmate relationships . it never positive experience , dysfunction real female inmate vs tv inmate makes latter unbelievable . reality , women prison isn't healthy environment where healthy relationships evolve . it place where women offenders various crimes grouped together , egoes , violent behaviors , battered scars , addiction patterns really surface create nauseating work environment officers staff . anyone who ever worked prisons any length time would view this cringe . it insulting women prison staff media comes out these show	-1

first , commentor erronously stated happy days owes its inspiration american graffiti when actually pilot ron howard shot 1971 ( eventually shown love american style episode 1972 ) then shelved garry marshall . it said lucas even asked look footage ascertain whether howard would suitable steve bolander . course excitement project reivigorated success american graffiti , but no way owes inspiration it . movie , it nearly perfect . even though it half-generation before my own , it still evokes sense nostalgia . there ache soul when one contemplates cusp change , losing something special , knowing best days slipped into past . this movie captures this concept magnificently . acting superior , editing great , direction pitch perfect ( why star wars i-vi inhabited wooden cut-outs mystery me ) . movie doesn't overstay its welcome almost 2 hours it flies , if anything seems too short , not characters underdeveloped , you just want see more what soon memory . movie treat you just want it even bigger . it nice level it ron howard richard dreyfus before they became ron howard richard dreyfus . relative unknowns performances generally free pretensions . all around must see movie my top 10	1
i read several reviews series , devoted viewer during series ' run , i think uproar lack original soundtrack music laced each episode tempest teapot . producers these dvd faulted , however , not printing disks correct markings so we know which episodes disks . they mysteriously blank making it real guessing game which disk play , especially if you trying stay original sequence . other than , this show writing its best creative direction , faultless photography location , fine ensemble cast . filmed fictional alaska town cicily without laugh track or live audience sound stage , each script stood test time multiple stories taking place each episode . one particular episode one my favorites . character , ed , gave storekeeper ruth ann mason jar dirt her birthday . it grave site he bought her . end episode pays off ed heart-felt gift he drives ruth ann site overlooking magnificent river valley . she then askes ed first " dance grave " her . tears viewer guarenteed . so , my fellow devotees , give up your angst over original soundtrack remember scripts , dialogue performances what they : unforgotable collectable	1
her comic teaming rock hudson tony randall 1959 mega hit " pillow talk " , produced ross hunter doris day , ten years successful film work already behind her entered into her most successful period film stardom where her teamings likes hudson , james garner cary grant made her most popular female star her time . less well known this period this once only pairing she david niven 1960 " please don't eat daisies " . despite not high profile like day/hudson teamings this effort went become huge hit mgm ended up studio biggest money earner year after " butterfield 8 " , starring elizabeth taylor . while not hilarious comedy vein this effort provides interesting balance drama comedy its story theatre critic rise heights his profession who then discovers he loses everything real value including his family way . chief joy " please don't eat daisies " , my belief most pleasing very compatiable chemistry two very different lead performers . doris day david niven work off each others very different personality surprisingly effective way which makes them appear like they indeed real married couple trying cope change their personal professional crcumstances resulting husband getting his big break theatre critics circle . although doris day most fondly remembered comedies late 1950 early 1960 " sex comedies " , rock hudson james garner , this quietly amusing family comedy something every doris day fan should include their film collections . film one those early 1960 efforts successful it spawned mid ' 60 television series same name lasted couple seasons but which course not doris day david niven leads . different type leading man englishman david niven , doris proves herself just adept working him she american leading men she her more famous collaborations . while not funny or memorable day/hudson teamings such films " pillow talk " , " lover come back " , i strongly recommend you take time sit down enjoy this often quite serious little domestic comedy some themes just timely today they 1960 . doris day always highly entertaining any her films whether they drama or comedy mgm 1960 hit " please dont eat daisies " , no exception . enjoy	1

i afraid even before watching this movie degree realism going par days thunder ( cars slamming into each other constantly , wrecked cars winning races , etc ) it only took few minutes viewing me realize this movie far , far worse . aside fact none actors could perform their way out old paper bags , movie moves such rapid pace it almost makes you dizzy . now degree realism . i understand not all car races electrifying , but i see no reason there spectacular crash every single race . i never 18 years watching indycar races seen car go flying off track into water hazard . that why barriers there . also , those indycars aerodynamically designed so if track turned upside-down , cars would stay glued course , yet they fly off ground this movie like they made out tissue paper . good lord , joyride through chicago stupidest scene whole movie . it would interesting scene aside fact indycars can't start themselves . even worse , neither one drivers even gets trouble it ...... don't get it . this movie makes days thunder look like masterpiece cinema . if you want watch racing movie , rent . not driven . absolutely not driven	-1

this astounding film so prescient regarding our current plight it could considered prophetic . andy griffith astonishing his role lifelong failure screw-up who discovered groomed into folksy demagogue svengali-like character ( portrayed movie patricia neal life karl rove ) . fronting sinister group conservative wealthy big-business-types , larry " lonesome " rhodes manages get one them elected president talking him up stints joking , banjo-playing " jes ' folks " radio ( here fiction present reality diverge somewhat ) . familiar me his work " andy griffith show " , i not seen such remarkably successful casting against type since avuncular fred mac murray 60 tv show " my three sons " played weaselly , self-serving navy officer " caine mutiny " . you might say this movie happy ending : just when " lonesome " rhodes zenith his power popularity , patricia neal decides leave microphone open after one his broadcasts ends so public learn what he really thinks them . instead folksy patter , country stupefied they overhear venomous contempt them stream their radio speakers . , rhodes finished . concluding half-hour which follows harrowing scene rhodes returns his luxurious home proceeds emotionally disintegrate before eyes skeptical unsympathetic walter matthau . ( people who made " network " get their ideas peter finch character breakdown this scene ? ) standpoint story whole , movie could ended soon after scene open mike , but sight ol ' " lonesome " raving , bawling , wallowing self-pity one viewer not likely forge t.t he most disturbing thing this film evident faith elia kazan-a patriot who endured much vilification testifying against stalinist communists movie industry-that people , though mislead , would eventually catch would right thing . no means clear moment . instead , there plenty evidence public turned away serious news ( it may tell them things they not want hear ) towards infotainment plays their fears , hates , vanities , delusions ignorance . contrast , they shown themselves appallingly credulous towards official assurances prevarications sort usually seen only nazi or soviet propaganda . indeed totalitarian propaganda , even " lonesome " rhodes ' pseudo-populist cornpone seem hopelessly primitive compared today state art . even so , worst lies always ones told one self . when country reacts officially condoned torture murder prisoners something like `they would never ! besides , what wrong it anyway ?

i saw this movie kid mentioned it my two teenagers once when they saw picture lee marvin drunken horse leaning against building . they never heard movie so i purchased it we watched it family . although it bit slow today standards kids really enjoyed it brought friends over see it . lee marvin performance itself makes movie well worth owning .	1
i am definitely not barbie fan , but my four year old daughter . she developed love ballet , classical music femininity watching barbie movies . morales honest , friendly all , unselfish , caring , hardworking , modest etc . touched throughout movie open way talk some issues my daughter her level understanding . i would highly recommend all barbie movies moms daughters sit together some fun girl time . it not often movie come that entertaining both child adult - wholesome without any adult innuendos or humor .	1
i gave my daughter this 2 disc edition christmas now gotten see extras included second disc . movie itself looks great what i think improvements stage production ( switching cool gee officer krupke ; swapping america tonight ; adding boys america ) but i wish they not omitted ballet sequence . get cast recording carol lawrence larry kert hear how great ballet sequence sounds . this musical deserves seen big screen ( or least big screen tv killer sound system ) appreciated wonderful score . everything could said songs bernstein sondheim wrote said so i can't add anything there . forget idea natalie wood playing puerto rican enjoy great movie . see stage production if it ever comes your town	1
start out , i won't even comment your inability , ( or rigid unwillingness i can't conceive anyone thick enough not ability , ) grasp concept synergy , i.e. buckminster fuller , i.e. sum whole greater than , or capable transforming definition seperate parts , but , i think your bent mind you obscured clouds narrow perception . you even know meaning word obtuse ? i don't think so . this film extremely existential anthropomorphic but quite reverse obtuse . so , risk truly obtuse , look word up dictionary . then try using it proper context . but then , if you weren't so obtuse you would already know . but i digress , review : this film , ( while admittedly bit afield novel , well extremely toned down sexual angle ) , fairly brilliant scene where ' agent ' conversation ' agent ' while walking down street , mouthing conversation while we hear each person private thoughts , while not original concept , quite original style . ( woody allen same thing you recall ' annie hall ' but subtitles . using actual ' thought dialogue ' voices cronenberg raised device kitchiness surreallism . cool !	1
cheech chong already bunch albums under their belts since 1971 , so they weren't exactly new when up smoke hit theaters september , 1978 . i often seen this movie network tv , unfortunately , it so drastically butchered because they censor lot , not mention all commercials . but course i get this movie vhs or dvd . i ended up dvd , which some bonus features , including bunch unused clips , even audio commentary lou adler cheech marin movie , i actually got some useful info them movie , some trivia it ( like vw beetle tommy chong driving rolls royce radiator strapped front near beginning film actually belonged jack nicholson ) . it seemed only natural lou adler would direct this film , after all , cheech chong albums produced adler ( released his ode label , which included various music acts like carole king psychedelic band spirit ) . it fantastic film full laughs . much what i want say i can't say here because it won't get posted ( because content ) , but it basically two hippies trying escape law , get deported mexico , return america van made marijuana , enter rock band contest . speaking which , there this scene during " rock fight " ( where these punk rock bands play ) there this one singer who so badly wanted mick jagger , it hurts , audience started throwing beer cans him ( music sounded like stones ripoff ) . but course , end cheech chong performing " earache my eye " ( alice bowie this movie ) . this cut originally appeared their wedding album ( 1974 ) , but course it only musical part included this film . speaking music , while saturday night fever capitilized disco craze , up smoke seemed pick up punk rock craze . both styles music came out around same time ( though disco much more popular america because it moneymaker ) pretty much brought end prog rock psychedelia came before it . what really strange cheech marin tommy chong quite bit older than real musicians involved punk rock scene . up smoke truly great movie , so its following , cheech chong next movie , so make sure you get both	1
this yet wonderful offerring clint eastwood . this movie clint plays red , aspiring guitarist singer who dreams performing memphis . we see red deterioration through tuberculosis movie progresses . his final cry lost love more believable than anything i seen or read so called " master vulnerable sentimental nostalgia " tennessee williams . i give this movie 5 stars because mr. eastwood can't sing which means he something common most country music stars today	1

i didn't even see this movie i know it sucks . all i see bon jovi i threw video ground hard i could muster video store where i promptly kicked out . it worth it though , it actually offensive such thing could exist . vampire genre could so awesome yet very few films live up its potential . i guess it also lends itself complete drivle such " vampires - los muertos "	-1

almodovar making quite name himself recently , it easy see why . his films called daring while still engaging topics particular focus interest society today . his characters willing silent when needed , which good independent film motif some odd reason lot filmmakers don't seem fully understand power . he uses somewhat hitchcockian style his movies , which always good way boost favor amongst critics film snobs . furthermore , this film features none other than gael garcia bernal , strongest actor working spanish-language films one strongest actors around today . short , this film would fail marvelously any less than good , thus it very damn good . storyline itself sort approach could only around today , but which lot stylistic roots we've come accept past , mainly film noir . when two characters exit film noir festival movie say , " it like they us , " it not just almodovar paying homage greats past , it him recognizing expressing exactly what his film . i like it because it several layers narrative narrative-within-a-narrative force me question how much it actually " true " some it may based real life experiences almodovar . however , i don't know because i don't know anything almodovar biography ... i don't care . but point film narrative style forces us question it biographical sources , kind like movie like matrix or existenz forces us question our own reality presenting multiple levels virtual realms . r-rated version : really , my suggestion you see nc-17 version . r-rated version poor job hiding its imagery it badly produced censorship ( including pixellations ... ugh ... ) make it seem more pornographic than scenes actually . -- polarisdi	1

this great film true spirit basic plot dickens . songs melodically wonderful choreography original , fresh keeps your eyes constantly screen . movie very well cast ron moody wonderful fagin . he " nicer " than book ( maybe it pet owl they gave him ) but his basic motivations actions remain same albeit he happier more ambiguous ending film . oliver reed probably more physically attractive bill sikes than one most people imagine reading dickens ' work but he certainly menacing scary . nancy , also , much lovelier ( well older ) than novel describes but part excellently acted sung shani wallis . child actors all engaging not smugness ( well artful charlie supposed " cheeky " ) too many times seen young kids movies . plot simplified book few characters like rose oliver evil half brother monks left out time sake but it not hurt story since it could argued original too many complicated subplots . some " exciting " scenes added action loving moviegoer rather disturbingly innocent oliver present scenes both nancy bill demise . mr. mrs. bumble not larger , very comic , parts they play both novel originial musical though mr. bumble " law then sir bachelor ... may he learn experience " speech included almost word word dicken original writing many other critical speeches throughout film . oliver wonderful gem whole family enjoy . dvd flipped over there not many extras but these minor quibbles such great viewing experience .	1

after reading reviews synopsis here amazon ( which same back dvd ) , i thought this looked like it would very good movie promising plot . within first fifteen minutes , however , it not all i expected . first , summary stated anna manni ( police investigator played asia argento , daughter director one only redeeming features this movie ) hot trail serial killer/rapist would captured because attack stendhal syndrome . this misleading because this actually happens early movie ( before any her tracking him down shown ) . other words , if you expecting see movie beautiful , strong-willed police detective trying capture serial killer , this not movie you . instead it [ mostly ] journey into mind greatly disturbed ( possibly psychotic ) rape victim . overall quality this movie also not nearly great it director reputation . this my first dario argento movie , it grave disappointment . after hearing " argento genius , " i really expected movie great editing , dialogue least decent horror movie style soundtrack . this movie instead opposite all counts . finally , style presented leaves lot desired . it basically mashing together sci-fi , horror , drama , even romance doesn't quite work ( some parts so outlandish i could not help but laugh ) . short , save your money worthier movie not follow flawed script begin , not attempt such " stylistic " filmmaking .	1
this movie amazing ! i love how scenery changes mood , while most directors just change lighting background music . akira kurosawa takes art movie making takes it up whole other level brilliance	1

i intrigued see this film again after " remake " popped up 2005 . scanning all video stores shops cape town try find copy . unfortunately no avail . until " lock-down " special edition popped up - obviously remind us all before adam sandlers version , or vinnie jones ... it burt " deliverance/the bandit " reynolds who delivered blows one all time great prison football movies . i very impressed film made 31 years ago still some kick !!! lets honest , you not going get " matrix " style footage , no overly impressive slow-mo or thumping music - but take it what robert aldrich hoped we would . cleverly made action-comedy offers great way escape 2 hours . film under-tones dirty dozen coming through - recruiting bunch misfits all out spectacular mission . this case , turning tables guards delivering some punishment inflicted them full duration their sentences . all all - still magnificent film . 31 years ago - it must epic . burt - well he always great watch !!! let hear it : " mean machine " , " mean machine " , " mean machine " !!! small footnote those wanting buy it : transfer great . colours good , offered widescreen , but sound mono , not 5.1 ! ( this may just copy offered south africa - but i doubt it ) there also one scene where voice/picture overlay doesn't quite fit ... but flick made 31 years ago ... it all accepted !!! worth shelf watch lazy sunday afternoon !!!	1

you don't appreciate stephen king works like this great movie based one king better stories . not only outstanding performances main supporting cast makes dead zone standout it own , fine direction , camerawork , editing atmosphere makes it all worth while , also . first few minutes after beautiful opening sequence which title becomes visible piece piece , you could amazed honest close real life acting qualities christopher walken . further movie , other performances believable his i think this makes tdz again , great movie . still , you see yourself it make your own observations get your own opinion . if you see tdz years ago when it came out , liked it , want buy copy dvd ( again , maybe ) , than this version you'd want . extra fine nice , but : picture quality well sound quality greatly improved . i should emphasise ' improved ' because it major enhancement . it looks like it put disc yesterday - , today technologies mastering equipment just after it shot , almost , high definition camera equipmen t.t he picture quality really very impressive sound stage like you're there . it all you could want , especially movie this age . get it enjoy , like i . highly recommended	1

controversial french director catherine breillat " brief crossing " ( 2001 ) mesmerizing 80-minute knockout follows two very different travelers they meet overnight ferry cruise enter into steamy one-night affair . twist here odd couple thirtysomething englishwoman 16-year-old french schoolboy . breillat obviously inspired david lean classic " brief encounter . " however , similarities end there . anyone who seen any breillat previous features ( including [ hot ] " romance " " fat girl " ) know , director isn't interested telling conventional love story so much chronicling psychological fallout sex . this film no exception . breillat herself says revealing interview accompanies film , she made film simply because she wanted explore loss young male virginity . this case , it young thomas ( gilles guillan ) , who meets alice ( sarah pratt ) while ordering dinner , then begins mutual flirtation amused woman after she invites him share table her . over course next hour , they share much revealing conversation , then eventually fall into bed together . what happens next best left viewer experience . obviously centerpiece this film sexual encounter , let just say it beautifully handled director her two actors . perhaps because tender age her young star , breillat doesn't push envelope far she " romance , " leaving it up viewer decide just how real encounter . ( rest assured , young guillan 19 when he made film , but still virgin according director . ) still , it eye-opening moment . so , if you're one easily offended on-screen sexuality , pass this one up . acting pratt guillan perfect . dinner scene particular brilliantly handled . it fascinating watch older woman trying act younger while young boy puffs cigarette vainly tries impress older woman acting much older than he . last fifteen minutes especially ring true , last-minute twist ends film exactly right note . all , " brief crossing " minor film which sacrifices plot tell simple story two disparate souls who make once-in-a-lifetime connection . ending sad but honest , leaves viewer make his own judgments woman behavior .

this movie really good , it arty , scary , gothic , top it off bauhaus begining . it really depressing movie but doesn't take away anything it just makes you love movie much more , but it alittle hard follow sometimes vampires don't really anything cool ( they feed cutting you there cute little necklesses then sucking wound ) but it still works . there mad chicks making out too . i could see why some people would hate it though , it slow sometimes , artiness alittle much sometimes , it really really depressing . but if you're into sort thing this movie perfect you ( i loved it i stole it hollywood video am still collecting late fees )	1

wow , many reviewers really bashed this film . we just bought dvd our daughter , she absolutely loved it . after watched special features section detailing how rodriguez family devised story , my daughter writing illustrating multitudes original , imaginary scenes her own . adult , i actually enjoyed movie very much . sure , it step away reality , but it revitalized imagination creativity our household . dreaming very bizarre peculiar phenomenon , so i think pure imagination depicted film justified . i haven't seen movie so imaginative entrancing since first time i saw gene wilder willie wonka hbo seven-year-old boy . it corny cheesy , but give it chance try not negatively biased scathing critiques . watch it your kids . they'll enjoy your company . you might like it	1
personally , i found 8 1/2 one most boring films i've ever seen . it pretentious , self-indulgent trip down director memory lane . i understood plot , enjoyed some thoughts raised near end , but overall bored silly stilted , pointless dialogue . said , cinematography stunning music almost made film worth watching . perhaps 8 1/2 would better off series photographs musical accompaniment :p	1
this one worst movies i ever seen . characters unlikeable except charity two friends . songs far too long i fast forward through most them because they so dull . i especially disappointed big spender because i love song expected spectacular dance number bob fosse all they stand there draped over bar . only redeeming factor sammy davis jr. it . he awesome even though song fairly stupid . this my first shirley maclaine film back it said sweet charity her best movie . i no desire see her other movies then	-1

unbearable lightness considered unfilmable novel good reason : point kundera writing not his plot - or even his characters - but his style . instances , his endless digressions history , politics , philosophy . movie , we left nothing but plot character . ok , what one ? itself wouldn't so bad if i didn't watch film constant thought : i could read book less time than it takes me watch this movie . this slow film . it takes hour-and-a-half story takes three hours tell it . i can't recommend film	1

i love this dvd . it very easy use you pre-program what workout you want , depending your time constraints , your own physical needs level . 1 . 20 minute cardio workout . i'm doing low intensity ( high intensity also available ) cardio i find it very enjoyable . i love all workouts this segment - those which include grapevine , shuffle , lunges , rainbow , almost all movements . even my 3-year old daughter loves them , so she imitates me while watching me workout . i went through high intensity me , low intensity lot more fun . 2 . 10 minute upper body . i'm also doing low intensity ( but dvd medium high too ) but instead chair , i use stability ball when i'm doing weights . i find it more flexible it ball than chair . 3 . 10 minute lower body . i don't consider my lower body main problem spot , so now , i skip this section due time constraints . that why this dvd so good , you choose what you want , depending your needs ! this also available low , medium high intensity . i went through section , though , find variety lower body exercises which i haven't seen some yet . i try this when i luxury time . ;-) 4 . 10 minute abs . this my problem spot so i always make it point this all time . this tough you would really feel it working all sections your abs . there lot variation basic crunches which i find very useful . i hope it works visibly , though ! i lot flab hiding my 6-pack . lol ! 5 . last segment stretching which basically usual stretching we see , but course , very important cool down . all all , i give this dvd 5+ stars easy use workouts doable but effective . i guess i'm fast becomming denise fan . i enjoy her workouts me her talkies not distracting . but if you get annoyed her voice , there also function play music only . buy this , it worth it	1

this show original idea , take old movies ham up language make them funny wacky . this whole show played max hokey . it aired 1960s ( those you under 45 may not want apply ) seeing it now dvd includes bit nostalgia watch these shows again . these shows played laughs , hans conreid , host , doing most this line play . explain theme this show , they took old movies lot effort created wacky dialogue " update " silents make plot (?) out them completely different thesis than silent movie once showed . i no idea how they found so many old movies " improve " , but it amusing then ( 60 , when this show aired ) watch this it now too . if you like rocky bullwinkle , you'll like this show essentially same group , uh , artisans (?) . it not seinfeld-style humor , nor stand-up comic humor , instead this sort very hokey , consciously self-pretentious , over-done sort humor makes you laugh much their silliness their puns their frankly funny adaptations old movies into absurdities dubbed dialogue . it interesting combination old silent movies added-on dialogue . not everyone , great some us .	1

this collection definitely worth any remington steele fan , but last two seasons series together one set , it very uneven package . if i could break it down , i would give 5 stars season 4 , 2 stars season 5 , 3 stars extras . season 4 not best series . show already passed its peak , but it still quite good . season some classic episodes , including " beg , borrow or steele , " which laura mr. steele presumed dead mildred arrested their murder , " dancer , prancer , donner steele , " christmas episode which gang taken hostage bunch santas , " sensitive steele , " most in-depth exploration relationship we ever get show . other episodes like " coffee , tea , or steele , " " steele blushing , " " steele your service , " " forged steele , " " steele running " very strong well . even weaker episodes like " suburban steele " " steele inc . " their moments . although some other reviewers pointed out , series started look more dated less " classic " fourth year , overall , it still its trademark charm , wit , sophistication . character development season 4 , mildred discovers secret mr. steele invented miss holt , so dynamic among three changes bit . relationship laura mr. steele also develops little over course season , but usual this show , we given just enough make us want more , never enough satisfy . often referred show " foreplay , " rs delivers not delivering . season 4 provides plenty little romantic moments keep us intrigued couple -- we even see them admitting other people they're " committed " each other -- but they still never consummate relationship . yes , some complained , if you think it , it bizarre two healthy adults could such hot heavy romance four years still remain chaste , but you're not really supposed think it too much . that why , few exceptions , only minute or two per episode devoted relationship . tease , perhaps , start wear little thin season 4 . if show continued full year , some point they would fish or cut bait relationship . but me , amazing chemistry pierce brosnan stephanie zimbalist keeps me coming back more throughout fourth season , even when i realize i'm played little writers who wanted their cake eat it too . time we reach fifth season , however , everything changed . others mentioned , show cancelled after fourth season , most things come back dead , it never same again . mercifully short fifth season very " we don't want here " feel it . exotic locations serve poor substitutes good story-telling character development . plots become thin tedious . humor goes clever overly silly farcical . characters inconsistent previous seasons . inclusion jack scalia ( tony ) cast totally throws off dynamic worked so well what classy , silver-screen-inspired romantic duet . basically , show lost its heart . fans not get emotionally satisfying ending , it still makes me little bitter after all these years . extras same other seasons , just little less . i know you can't expect much extras such old show , well , you don't get much . there few featurettes okay . farewell steele one make me very nostalgic sad see series come end ( again ) . i give extras three stars instead two , because these featurettes , especially because they able get interviews all three stars . that probably big coup such old show . what i didn't care much extras episode commentaries . i already mentioned this my review season 3 , but i really wish whoever charge putting together extras dvds like this would send commentors copy ahead time so they could take 45 minutes watch show before doing commentary it . it not interesting listen people guessing plot points they don't remember episode you just watched . you expect hear something interesting , it little insulting viewer commentors ramble , laugh in-jokes , constantly interrupt each other , etc . -- basically terrible job . what even more annoying one commentary guy who actually joked what bad job they doing . yes , it hilarious waste time people who support show who spent good money these dvds . anyway , i'm not saying there not some good bits information commentaries , but they're few far . overall , though , disappointing final season poor commentary skills people involved series take away little these dvds or series whole . it great whole set , wealth wonderful episodes -- all 94 -- right there nice , convenient package , return whenever i want . but i'm also little wistful this last set . seeing my favorite childhood show dvd first time close i ever get recapturing magic watching it when it originally aired . now i've savored every episode -- good , bad , big-haired--it sad say goodbye again	1

japanese-american raised 1960 , i always mixed feelings 1961 film version rodgers hammerstein chinese-american musical comedy . although it refreshing see so many asian faces mainstream studio movie ( granted several japanese-american actors chinese roles ) , portrayals always struck me trite catering pre-existing stereotypes . now it finally come out dvd forty-five years after its initial release , i appreciate it much more without raising my eyebrows much , perhaps because it now seems so much nostalgic product eisenhower-era sensibilities . reason dvd contains pristine print balances saturated use color throughout . moreover , there music , which while not grade-a material legendary team , enough their recognizably melodious style make whole affair quite entertaining now . set san francisco chinatown late 1950 , souffl�-light story , written joseph fields , family-oriented , musical-chairs romantic comedy focused east-west cultural differences primarily well-to-do wang household headed ultra-traditional master wang . it starts pretty mei li , who stowed away chinese steamer her professor father become mail-order bride nightclub owner sammy fong . en route , they end up staying wang home where she develops crush eldest son wang ta . but he infatuated saucy showgirl linda low , who intent making sammy jealous enough him propose after five years non-commitment . wang ta linda turn out mismatch , which would good news if only mei li marriage contract not so binding . if situation not complicated enough , dressmaker doormat helen chao lifelong crush wang ta well . all-asian cast assembled , rarity itself back then , it helps most perform within constraints movie quite well . looking like porcelain doll brought life , miyoshi umeki lends her uniquely plaintive quality role mei li , she sings quiet clarity her trademark song , " hundred million miracles " . wang ta , james shigeta , also pleasant singer , sincere matinee idol looks match , although his na�ve character seems excessively dim when it comes women . both , however , overshadowed shenanigans provided nancy kwan , her pin-up cutie peak , linda , jack soo full dean martin mode cynical sammy . even though their stormy relationship seems lifted completely nathan adelaide " guys dolls " , they provide lion share entertainment domestic fantasy , " sunday " particular highlight . while dubbed , kwan performs boudoir classic , " i enjoy girl " , sexy flair , she dances graceful exuberance " fan tan fannie " especially " grand avenue " virtual battalion dancers . benson fong , who memorably played charlie chan #3 son his youth , brings necessary bluster master wang , while juanita hall , bloody mary " south pacific " , stays mainly sidelines understanding auntie liang except when she solos " chop suey " . supporting cast , two performers stand out - teenaged patrick adiarte dancing energetically younger son wang tan , lovelorn helen , reiko sato leads stunning ballet show best song , " love , look away " ( her voice dubbed legendary soprano marilyn horne ) . opening credits showcase series striking watercolor paintings artist dong kingman , russell metty richly colorful cinematography finally appreciated dvd . 2006 dvd extras generous starting solid commentary track kwan british film historian nick redman . even though kwan sometimes gets derailed her life story , she redman partner well bringing out intriguing aspects production cast . there five featurettes which feel like components one feature-length documentary since same participants show up all five . first one talks story transition original novel c.y. lee broadway musical directed gene kelly 1961 movie 2002 broadway revival developed david henry hwang . other shorts focus casting , score , sets costumes , more personal look rodgers hammerstein . it interesting how veteran filmmaker henry koster barely mentioned since he directed film , though his pedestrian direction truly least impressive part movie	1
great performance who , although they pinch less-rehearsed here ( this 1999 gig one very first times , if not first time , who stripped away all extra brass , backup singers , second guitar extra percussion ) than they reunion arena dallas , texas , aug . 27 , 2000 , but they still rocked . i could used little more camera angles john entwistle ( rip ) , last half or third show seems concentrate more townshend daltrey . but still great show . band fighting form , even amid couple goofs - daltrey early entrance near end " anyway , anyhow , anywhere , " townshend breaking two or three strings during show , keeping soundman bobby pridden hopping stratocasters hand . who still best band around . this show , seemingly short around 90 minutes , would morph into 2000 tour , which would group best post-keith moon tour . i agree previous reviewer . lack special guests ( i love paul weller/the jam ) makes this dvd favorite . it interesting townshend daltrey seem almost feuding this show . townshend makes fun daltrey messing his inner-ear sound monitors near end show , telling audience , " thanks letting us experiment you . well , some us experimenting . " who still rock , although they're not quite strong when ox thumped bass them ( or when moonie drummer ) , but they're still greatest live band now . beginners should pick up " kids alright " dvd first , then move this video " live isle wight 1970 " ( 2006 version two bonus songs ) dvd . boston 2002 dvd , released late 2004 first tour new bassist pino palladino , good , but maybe not best starting point potential ' oo heads . 2000 royal albert hall dvd ( released fall 2001 ) good too , " concert new york city , " where who four-song set worth price admission alone ! who rocks . can't wait see them dallas seven days	1

don't want create war previous reviewer , but after watching this fun flick last night , i throw my 2 cents . if you looking deep , touching , sensitive moving film then don't bother this one ( cover art clearly shows you what expect ) . also if you're kind person who doesn't appreciate beauty dirty joke , then move something else . now if you looking something different , hysterical , funny , then buy this now ! we ( myself 6 friends ) watched this last night we laughing so hard we crying . fact , we pause it several times we couldn't control our laughter we missing continuing dialogue . i think that what this film all ......... fun entertaining . i don't think writers/producers/directors/actors high hopes oscar . too clarify my rebuttal my title ...... " america prove british approach " ...... these artists took comedy ala benny hill but gay twist it .	1
i know it probably all said , but yes , i extremely disappointed not see original ending included movie . so i watched extras , shivering anticipation this mythical " original ending . " let down again ! we aren't even given final version ! bah ! sorry , but i've always rooted duckie . he least deserved some screen time dancing his true love . but- it still great movie , other extras quite satisfying , such " favorite scenes " which includes duckie infectious dance try little tenderness fight duckie steff ( you love shot duckie peering over edge balcony down steff , staring him down look death ) . i really disappointed not hear james spader extras . he always my favorite jerk . " you got problem , friend ? " those linen suits penny loafers no socks ?! i just can't get enough his smug , self-satisfied rich boy . also , hearing cast talking john hughes ' behind scenes- directing interesting . you see how he got most his actors . more i watch this movie , more i am convinced there never stronger teenage actress than likes molly ringwald . her pout , her passion , her fury- quintessential redhead . " what prom , blane ?! " so , conclusion , dvd worth watching ( or renting ) but i don't feel need replace my vhs copy just yet	1

i think anthony hopkins gives terrific portrayal paul ( not i've ever met paul .... :) he brings lot character i never really considered reading bible . he great job " humanizing " paul . paul such tremendous apostle start christian church . i think hopkins given us , this film , look paul truly shows his human side . i tried understand what might paul " thorn flesh . " maybe it his arrogance ( he stated himself ) . i've always thought it possibly some physical impairment but after seeing this movie , maybe it more pride , etc . interesting perspective . anyway , i highly recommend movie . it shows some what bible describes relationship peter paul . film stays pretty close what bible describes ( certainly taking little artistic license ) filling some places . even though very well .	1

there old saying , if you nothing nice say , say nothing all . but i feel compelled critique this film , partly because i really liked what i think it trying say ... follow your heart , not what necessarily popular , follow bohemian lifestyle if what makes you happy . o.k. this film instead comes across one produced major corporation get us all thinking heading back home suburbs . because really what it saying even if you all idealism world , it only land you ghost town like woodstock , n.y. , full self doubt , hypocritical trappings . first all acting not bad , i no issues acting . fact other fine actors this film , colin farrell should angry . their true abilities developing characterization seem written , directed , edited right out this film . there little or no subjective viewpoint these characters lives . viewer left outside looking , wondering where these characters coming , or what they motivated . this film forces us assume everything order believe anything , without dramatizing or exemplifying why these characters feel way they . effect clear , screen-writer director apparently anesthetized these characters into poseurs masked sterotypes ; only thing left certain , only thing derived , they truly believe hair color , haircuts , one-night stands . " home end world , " wants us believe it making liberal statement , wants us swallow whole enchilida . using home metaphor terminal disease create sympathy itself , what this film really lead us down road good intentions home decorated bad taste .	1

john barrymore over-the-top reading egomaniacal producer oscar jaffe absolutely brilliant howard hawks ' screwball farce . you basically just sit back awe barrymore improvises variety histrionics , facial contortions , animal noises , etc . times i thought he throes dts . if you find fault film story struck me little thin , despite adapted stage play charles mcarthur ben hecht . also , i thought carole lombard , lovely she former lingeree salesgirl turned toast-of-broadway , came off little shrill . it seems like she trying go toe-to-toe barrymore but didn't comiedic chops work . falls short classic status but deinitely should checked out barrymore performance	1

i thought this comes out movie muslim considering ways west finding them bitter sweet best . women often try take additional man prove themselves ennui they feel home not their fault alone . what happens they need theory life religiously , socially or nationally approved set rules management details . without such code we find out men get better without women around save they vile know something missing . take feminism british men can't bear responsibilities women regularly carry out respecting spouse career . woman talented but man just himself . my suggestion characters would bit humility less rage what they little ability change . they both people worth . perhaps back music jay perform , manage or teach perhaps writing or directing would suit claire	1

1950 version " king solomon mines " deserves full 5 stars if only one reason -- it one few movies even this day which set africa , filmed africa , features actual africans portraying africans . particular , dance scene near end almost quality ethnographic film , worth watching itself because lead dancer one finest you ever see . while it true this movie barely same story . rider haggard novel , only good thing , book racist unbelievably sexist even 19th century standards . plot indeed full adventure , but there several points where descriptions game hunting ( without even taking trophies ! literally no reason ! ) made me nauseous . all means , read it get taste 19th century british attitudes toward their colonies . it ain't pretty , today standards . whether you love or hate plot movie , this film , its way , little piece history . it true african actors aren't main stars movie ( though some them so charismatic they steal their scenes ) . but lest we forget , 1932 , only 18 years before , edward . robinson loretta young , boris karloff myrna loy all played chinese people ( " hatchet man " " mask fu manchu " respectively ) because god forbid hollywood would actually cast chinese actors . it would long time before african or african-american actor would considered big enough star draw mainly white audiences , but " ksm " step right direction it lot more engrossing movie because it	1
i not into this movie all . my mother recommended it me but it lame all way through . middle-aged man decides he wants something different his life , so he takes dance class . ofcourse there fine dance instructor , crush pursued , wife gets jealous , hires detective , * gasp * his crush found out . movie too predictable it just wasn't me . not bad movie , just not my cup tea . richard gere cute usual , which only thing made me watch it end , besides wanting know what correct quick step looked like since " so you think you dance " never contestants who mastered it	1

grudge american remake japanese horror film . what different grudge it non-linear story line . first you think it three separate stories , then just two , finally you realize your seeing interspersed storylines past present they meet end film -- filling you curse what happening . ( think momento identity)the scariest part story , it pretty creepy , because curse born first murder kills indescriminately anyone who enters house . not immediately . not same way . no matter what you , you can't outwit it . if you house , it got your number . scariest thing most people involved innocent -- they nothing original killing , when seeing ghost while shocked , they tried help . yet , still they died . there might way avoid curse but unfortunately , it didn't get carried ou t.t here no cgi/fx -- everything low key creepy . i'd almost say this more psychological horror than monster coming get you horror but never they less -- you'll probably end up sleeping lights wondering if you should evere go into house you don't know anything again	1

biggest problem most people king kong its length , so there no surprise reaction general public release extended edition 3 hour-plus peter jackson film almost equivalent collective groan . surprise everything added extended edition king kong should never cut . more dinosaurs more creatures more action skull island only improves film , one wonders if these scenes cut mostly time pacing , why wasn't little bit 51 minutes pre-skull island snipped or perhaps few overly drawn scenes kong anna gazing into each other eyes ? more noticable scenes rampaging ceratops fun scene underwater monster attacking adrien brody co . while they rafting down river . bit more character development some seedy behavior carl denham ( jack black ) heroic deeds jack driscoll shipmates add bit flavor male characters literally overshadowed kong film . spider pit sequence also bit lengthened some more lines jack black . overall , worthy 13 minutes added material , but film still feels too long last act . special features this extended edition special features missing first release kong movie , including commentary peter jackson extensive behind scenes features , describing making kong concept artwork screen la performance andy serkis . i enjoyed extended cut , but i don't know this lengthy movie better served added material . it not like lotr films where additions enhance your viewing understanding tolkien world . but hey , i am not going complain more dinosaurs raft sequence i disappointed missing original cut	1
otto preminger directs this 1944 noir thriller starring gene tierney dana andrews . dana andrews plays mcpherson , hard-boiled detective investigating shocking murder society woman , laura , new york . mcpherson focuses waldo lydecker ( clifton webb ) , sardonic sophisticate who writes newspaper column radio talk show . lydecker good friend laura but despised her playboy fiancee shelby ( vincent price ) . process investigation mcpherson falls love laura portrait . fortunately mcpherson , laura returns -- apparently body girl found apartment not laura ! filming this story gorgeous black white cunningly utlized shadow threatens characters -- or reveals their underlying motivation . dana andrews ' curt athletic interpretation detective contrasts nicely talented vincent price who plays spoiled rich boy . clifton webb nice job poisonous , dried-out sophisticate . gene tierney laura gorgeous , charming elegant . unfortunately her character weakens rather than strengthens throughout film . laura starts out assertive individualist who challenges values sophisticated society . end film she docile female who found her man . story little melodramatic , all loose ends tied up too neatly -- good noir thriller leaves some mysteries unsolved . also , theme song little saccharine too often played . nevertheless well worth seeing enjoying	1

i first heard jean-claude brisseau secret things eminent film critic roger ebert , who reviewed movie one episode his ebert roeper show gave it thumbs-up , saying it one those rare erotic films also well-made fascinating . 19-year-old horny college student myself ( hehehe ) , i became rather interested seeing this film when it came out dvd . now i , my reactions it decidedly mixed . i frustrated while watching it , but after it over i rather admired it its sheer ambition . secret things basically two women attempt try climb up business ladder company seducing their way up . seems like simple-enough plot ... except , hands brisseau , it leads twists turns best described surreal over-the-top . what turns out unassuming little drama sex power becomes what you might call morality play , one heavy atmosphere symbolism . who would known scene which one characters sits chair her office quietly masturbates front her boss would eventually lead scene set what seems like some kind mansion/dungeon which lot people engage mass orgy ? it wasn't i necessarily minded brisseau blatant descent into this kind expressionism ; my problem simply much it came seem too pretentious . increasingly heavy-handed dialogue , portentous baroque music soundtrack , all-to o-o bvious symbol woman draped black bird her right shoulder --- all reeked writer-director seemed too much love his own wit . there clever , then there too clever , brisseau flirts frequently coming off too clever his own good : all self-conscious trickery risks obscuring whatever message he trying convey . it if he laughing fate his own characters , keeping his emotional distance he eventually destroys them . all may sound like i not like this movie very much . yet , after i finished watching it reflected bit upon it , i realized what perhaps brisseau getting all this over-the-top style . movie first seems female empowerment , two main female characters nathalie ( coralie revel ) sandrine ( sabrina seyvecou ) hatch their scheme try get top . but secret things turns out something little more universal little less gender-specific : it how quest power corrupt soul , make you little less human . perhaps it telling sandrine , who admits she never come man , finally reaches orgasm evil christophe ( fabrice deville ) , arrogant , cocky young ladykiller who all set inherit business his ailing father . sandrine herself gone so far her quest climb corporate ladder process she loses her innocence ideals love rejects delacroix ( roger mirmont ) , her boss office , mere " weakling " instead realizing he truly love her . nathalie , other hand , starts out cynical love movie , but slowly starts shedding cynicism she starts falling love herself . ending film , contrary what some people said it , perfectly logical context brisseau exploration search power highlighting dark night human soul . end , i began put pieces this movie together , i began develop some more admiration what brisseau pulled off secret things . power corrupting force not breathtakingly original theme movies ( look what happened tony montana brian de palma scarface ) , but brisseau explores it daring , boldly original , even relevant , way certainly fascinate you even if it occasionally frustrates you . most viewers probably find this film overheated almost insufferably pretentious ; but , look little deeper , perhaps style film its substance come together way make you respect it , if not necessarily love it . i think secret things worth look , despite reservations .	1

raging bull #24 100 best american movies ever , it among 1000 best movies dvd peter travers . later named best movie decade ( 80 ) , which i think true . i rate this movie 5 stars or 9.5 /10 . it nominated eight 1980 oscars , but won only two : de niro best actor , thelma schoonmaker her editing ( academy seems problem scorsese ) . schoonmaker appears one audio commentaries movie , martin scorsese , producer , real lamotta others . this dvd exactly what we collectors like special edition dvds . package beautifully ( yes ! package matters lot ) , containing small booklet some short essays pictures movie . then , this special edition comes second dvd full special features , such 4 behind-the-scenes featurettes , making documentary , trailers , some other very interesting stuff . this movie masterpiece . acting perfect , i don't only mean de niro , who got oscar this role my opinion one best actors ever , but joe pesci , who always sensational , cathy moriarty role vickie . shooting black white very wise decision , photography michael chapman , music ( cavalleria rusticana fits perfectly ) , editing got oscar also great job well , story , screenplay , even fight scenes just absolutely amazing ( i just hate violence ... ) . new york times put it " though it movie full anger nonstop physical violence , effect or raging bull lyrical " . i recommend this movie absolutely everybody . you like it sure . if you , get this special edition ( though while i am writing this review , it looks it not available anymore amazon ) . p.s. if you like my review vote yes . you read all my other reviews if you wish . i modestly write them help people form opinion movies , music books , but if nobody reads them ( if you don't vote i not know if you ) there no point writing them : -	1
flatliners horrific exploration after-death experiences , directed taut suspense joel schumacher ( client , batman forever , lost boys ) . it five medical students led kiefer sutherland ( lost boys ) carelessly experimenting death . each wants turn one time they bring each other brink their medical know-how , reviving volunteer within seconds - first , then daring each other go longer periods minutes . after sutherland experience he finds child his past haunting him , but hides his hallucinations others . william baldwin ( backdraft ) goes next , after his experience he sees reflections his sins - selfish promiscuity , primarily - everywhere around him . kevin bacon ( river wild , white water summer , stir echoes ) next , before results first two revealed , then julia roberts ( pretty woman , conspiracy theory ) , who insists her turn spite growing fears others . fifth member their group oliver platt ( simon birch , time kill ) . original idea , time film created , fascinating well scary , precursor such later efforts white noise . unfortunately there great deal foul language , considerable violence , unnecessary sex partial nudity ( particularly illustration baldwin case ) . i say " unfortunately " because otherwise i'd like show film everyone , idea so good , effectively delivers good message - " everything we matters . " but it , it not suitable children , certainly offensive many older viewers . if you're not bothered very r-ratedness , or dare watch spite it , i recommend movie whole-heartedly	1
" ring two " stars naomi watts david dorfman reprising their roles rachel aiden keller , family plagued samara morgan , demon child created video tape after death showed horrifying images killed viewers seven days after they watch it . original met great praise , labeled critics scariest movie since " exorcist " " rosemary baby " , even though i didn't find it scary all , just good mystery . " ring two " , rachel aiden moved new town , evidence arises local death may caused mysterious video tape . this inspires rachel , reporter , investigate . most critics don't like this film because it doesn't " atmosphere " original . since i've read books now how vastly different first second , i didn't expect it . you can't expect it , anyway , seeing how they two different directors . i'm quite sure this movie would better if gore verbinski direct , but studio hired director japanese film . it didn't work " grudge " it didn't work this , but it turned out better than what i expected . " ring " mystery video tape revealed , including where it came history who made it . ( though i admit , they could explained it better . book . ) " ring two " , we know what there fear so all there left throw it us see what happens . they try something new though , slightly resembles what occurs very end book , but much different happens middle . i didn't like how they just threw idea samara adopted us . i wish they explained it . they also kind overexagerated water . after fact villain later revealed , it kind makes sense but not really . i just hope fans react " dark water " well when they see it . i also really liked scene end well . there seems scene like end both them , one shocks you makes you flip out . ( first where she crawls out tv . ) all all , it very cool movie , one better ones i've seen recently . i'd give it 10/10 because it everything i thought it should . they close it off , but i still expect third . why wouldn't they it ?	1

this film creates impossible challenge this reviewer : convince one how important , even essential , movie coming terms not only modern art , but modern sensibility generally -- without however destroying wonder just viewing it . state ask trust , although such trust somewhat necessitated context : major american abstract-expressionist artist deserved reputation , although reputation virtually entirely established art world insiders would never established -- then , now , or perhaps forever -- general public . thus importance this film subject rests not only identity painter -- whose work and/or life one may or may not like -- but phenomenon elite art culture our time its paradoxical dominance wide open , democratic society such world never before known . there key paradox : film succeeds because aesthetic entirely opposed its subject : american realism . it if john huston or john ford persuaded make movie . obviously no one their type interested , so ed harris step it himself besides playing mercurial artist . couse he entirely uncannily subsumed role degree which just plain -- -- -- well , i cannot say it without destroying part your experience . please let harris it you himself . also marcia hartley who , turn , uncannily subsumed lee krasner . everybody else this picture , too . much commentary here amazon.com everywhere reflects fact our nation still often recoils realism , perhaps never happily embrace it . it our nation greatest gift , course , all artistic fields -- figures working against tide like pollack only underscore fact . however his artistic values , however abstract , really close 1st cousin -- absolute integrity emotion . you take or leave , too , there doubtless good arguments against it ( classic argument balance distance -- see titian portait doge venice , or sir joshua reynolds painting country squire ) but if you interested all american art or culture you better sooner or later know what counter view , just like you cannot study our history if you only read washingtons roosevelts , not custers or lee harvey oswalds . sum , without pasting too may more words over this immense wonder film , not assume it too overwhelming seen . just pick good night without distractions when you open i	1

moonlighting television show premiered march 3 1985 carried channel abc . it lasted through five seasons . moonlighting perfect example how good writing , talent chemistry come through tv viewers wanting more more one show . moonlighting also perfect example how top show reach bottom fail further please audiences , due lack commitment well evaporation magic chemistry . it long awaited event fans throughout world . moonlighting finally out dvd . personally , i it my videotaped versions show . i needed relive magic show beginning through help digital version . episodes run very wonderful it pleasure hear crystal clear musical theme every beginning . picture crystal clear audio digital stereo ( not 5.1 surround it stated technical characteristics ) . still , some points you notice audio changing stereo mono stereo again . issue comes up this dvd collection two first seasons fact some episodes altered . it seems ridiculous episodes altered when transferring dvd especially if you examine reason this . example , episode " funeral doornail " sex shop scene , there furniture superimposed front maddie moment she reading dirty magazine . clearly there no reason type censoring because front page magazine visible bit offensive prudish back `80s . there legal issue magazine this time around ? one only speculate . why they provide us classic episode " lady iron mask " newly recorded soundtrack ? it difficult gain rights musical themes played original episode ? people who new moonlighting such issues may trivial , but people who fond memories tv series such things matter . so what we ? we so anxious release moonlighting so we not stopped such minor technicalities . i rushed bought dvd collection two first seasons soon i could , not mention i already pre-ordered season 3 . no true fan left behind such treat their favourite television show . i need advertise show ? people who familiar there no reason all . this show many fans through out globe . i need advertise show younger unfamiliar generations ? surely enough saying television dialogue , character development television entertainment its best rolled into this old series . we only hope future episodes all restored their original form further more , there deleted scenes , there teaser 15 30 second tv ads much , much more . second time around doing professional job inclusion all this trivia because i am almost certain like me , great deal fans buy them all over again . just try keep away anniversary editions appear every five years include new item recently discovered . pretty much , i feel we all it predatory marketing started business trend during late `90s	1

skipping past my silly title , i actually liked this movie over arnold schwarzenegger first " predator . " while arnold incredible physique , danny glover more down-to-earth rely his wits more than arnold . danny glover plays maverick cop vein harry callahan clint eastwood dirty harry movies . danny hunts down columbian drug lords he runs across alien predator also hunting same columbian drug lords . while danny should happy someone else taking out columbian drug lords , apparently danny would rather it police instead alien hunter , so soon danny finds himself trail alien . original " predator " number plot holes easy ignore because nearly non-stop action . " predator 2 " even more plot holes , occasionally they intrude into action enough you pay attention them . perhaps biggest plot hole arrogance stupidity gary bussey government agent peter keyes . it seems action movies feds always end up portrayed too good everyone own good , including their own . if gary his team technologically astute they appeared , they should recognized alien could see their lights meat locker . while particular incident may biggest plot hole , there number others occasionally distracting i leave viewer discover . real charm this movie danny physically not match predator , thus must rely his intelligence thwart predator . predator clearly its own arrogance , which it ultimately pays , but way interaction glover alien provide some very good scenes . one scene predator danny glover very bad situation . danny able make use alien high tech boomerang weapon cut off alien hand . alien escapes into building across way . using cool looking colander alien mixes little glass some other ingredients make kind patch stub his arm . noise alien makes it puts molten glass ceramic its arm scares little old lady her bed , providing funny moment alien leaps out lady bathroom then her apartment , soon followed danny glover , who meantime found clever way get two apartment buildings . " predator 2 " not quite slick first " predator , " plot holes bigger . all , i thought " predator 2 " achieved more potential alien hunter than first movie , action more frequent more varied than first movie . first movie final show down main character alien , outcome just uncertain . while each movie its charms its weaknesses , i am sure some prefer first over second , i still think second lot offer . note there bunch versions this movie . sure choose version best meets your needs budget . enjoy !	1
i love this character " harold " i'm glad found dvd complete series . i find anything amazon	1
i bought dvd this artwork out dollar bin i got what i paid . image fuzzy audio poor quality . this must taken 16mm print . it may this film public domain , so it may difficult find decent quality dvd . there many issues this film so you would better try one other dvd issues . note : amazon seems spread these reviews across dvds same title , so you may see this review under multiple dvd releases " meet john doe " . poor quality dvd i bought cover looked like this : [ ...	-1

if you follow my reviews , you know i felt version " jack ripper " michael caine inspector fred abberline phenomenal masterpiece . not only michael caine phenomenal role , but version offered convincing speculation mystery we don't know never . while i respect this version johnny depp , it more horror oriented . ( michael caine version more historical . ) onto subject hand . some you may know jack 5 victims . ( mary anne nichols , annie chapman , elizabeth stride , kathy eadows , mary jane kelly . ) well , they seem close friendship , we also get impression they share some dangerous secret . ( michael caine version , 5 victims knew each other , but they just associates . ) well , course jack ripper comes into play . one scene very well while we don't see his face , we see some disturbing pictures , we see him cutting his steak pouring blood red wine . comes depp ( inspector fred abberline ) . it interesting while older michael caine brought frustration tremendous energy role , johnny depp looks like his character living borrowed time going die anyday . but maybe depp didn't want just imitate caine . one thing i problem while caine some trouble his superiors , depp trouble his superiors blown out proportion . ( without giving story away , his superiors must known things they didn't tell depp ! least caine superiors carried some reason their side ! ) you'll probably notice depp finds things out much quicker than caine . ( probably because caine version 4 hours , while depp only 2 . ) while caine involved artist , depp becomes involved mary jane kelly . gradually , depp discovers things put together interesting puzzle . like caine his version , depp ironically gets close almost friendly killer . ( course , depp not know he talking killer . ) well , problem here caine version , we understand more why killer appeared normal even friendly caine . we never really understand here why killer friendly even helpful depp . ( jack ripper not same mental illness he caine version . ) i admit scenery well , elements horror there , depp good job not just imitating michael caine . depp sergeant godley offer some entertainment . but if you saw michael caine version , you undoubtedly miss quite probable historical accuracy . if other hand , you don't mind fact this version more geared towards horror than history , you'll probably find it respectable horror movie . side note : johnny depp makes inspector fred abberline look like he going die anyday . well , reality , fred abberline lived 40 more years after he stopped jack ripper .	1
i could ( ) watched this movie over over again . it great	1
when i 10 years old , i saw this movie first time friend house when there sleepover . it scariest thing i ever seen . even since then , it my favorite horror movie or dare i say my favorite movie all time ? i think so . it classic . when i bought it dvd i expected bare bones edition nothing besides movie . i wrong . i shocked when i saw documentary including interviews john carpenter , debra hill , jamie lee curtis p.j. soles , among many others . i pleasantly surprised director commentary well . i usually don't watch films commentary because i find it ruins film , but ... i'm so fascinated this film i see . i highly recommened this film anyone , horror fan or not	1
i never followed western stories ... but college i took course studied western genre we read lonesome dove well critique movie . i walked away better understanding thoroughly enjoyed book well movie	1
this worst sequel i ever displeasure seeing . i knew it wasn't going good first one , but it this cheesy boring . they aged mia , got rid michael , threw her together some loser , made up some bogus law marriage . i really disappointed	-1
first one best thrillers ever , clever suspence , good characters , decent acting awesome effects . this one ... meh . why must you make sequel huge success hit turn franchise into straigh t-t o-video series ? what bloody point ? now there some good parts . rooms pretty nice musice score decent , but you know , doesn't even save it . this movie annoying , pointless downright piece crap only kids easily love . it so un-intelligent it really makes you wanna puke . characters nothing but cardboard cut-outs . i don't even know them well . all they scream , run around cube rooms cannot keep their mouths shut . i also really hate effects this one well . they felt like they over-used . there even scene where guy gets cut into peices look how badly it . direction ok , but when it comes adding wierdness , it too much . i don't understand story , there strange sex-scene which cube movie not need . cube suspence . this one just adding too much effects , four-dimensional cube trying make itself look better than first one . you don't need stuff . if you wanted make sequel better than first , add something original , don't take itself too seriously make sure it stays true original . but no , you just add all this unoiriginal time crap alot special effects taking over even sex scene which not cool because if it cube movie , you don't need nudity . overall , if you wanna kill off some time watching this crap , go ahead . i know you like watching people getting killed unoriginal ways watching sex scenes . if you're fan cube , dont ' bother . acting : 3/10ugh , don't get me started . these actors bad acting skills i hope they die . gore factor : 4/10cgi gore ?! come !? ta : 1/10a cube movie doesn't need nudity they don't know because they don't know cube . direction : 7/10andrzej sekula some visual eye some parts . i enjoy few scenes i dug rooms , but you know , i can't say he great director . he turned franchise straigh t-t o-video written all over it . bottom line : if you wanna watch , go ahead , then you'll sorry . this movie just sad . it doesn't try anything impress you because it idiotic . lets hope andrzej sekula learned his lesson should never sequel impressive indipendent film again	1
i greatly enjoyed both series 1 2 . costumes spectular . plot little tedious times , but there impressive cast different characters coming going throughout series . it also pleasantly predictable , so lot fun . my only complaint last episode mild cliff hanger , later episodes aren't available . my compliments amazon.com carrying these reviews . it only place i found indicated there more episodes come dvd . not even bbc . uk website provided information ! thanks , amazon volunteer reviewers	1
brad pitt angelina jolie star this action-packed thriller rather unorthodox married couple who very unique occupations . pitt jolie star john jane smith . both attending marriage counseling work out problems their marriage . jane works computers , while john works architect his friend eddie ( vince vaughn ) . they dinner each night 7 pm , neither much say . they live nice neighborhood friendly neighbors . but reality , there much more than meets eye . unbeknownst each other , both cooly lethal , highly-paid assassins working rival organizations . they both assigned same target , benjamin danz ( adam brody ) . both john jane show up intercept point , but reality , benjamin used bait draw out both john jane . organizations found out two married , there orders kill both them . jane soon discovers john one who foiled her attempt get benjamin , now she set her sights taking out her husband . what happens now battle among husband wife see who survive . john manage escape his wife ? they both realize they used bait much larger inter-organizational battle ? john jane join forces save each other ? i thought this very good movie . story very well-conceived . there lots action scenes , guns , knives , explosives , narrow escapes . there even elevator crashes ground top building . brad pitt angelina jolie perfect together , film keep you your toes throughout . i highly recommend this action-packed movie . this movie gives new meaning " till death us part " .	1

first , i give this 5 stars because subject matter subject matter importance , supplemental interviews dvd extras ; but not quality documentary filmmaking . more moment ... subject matter very , very , deadly serious . easily most important subject matter this decade certainly one top issues last 40 years . regardless whether you consider yourself one political camp or , or neutral ; you should know documentary looks both individual , very personal concerns such mother who lost her son war , also examines much broader , political economic aspects questions deserve attention , intelligent , calm discussion . **** even if you seen film disagree , you should watch dvd supplemental footage . if you miss these additional parts , you missing 50% information . please see #2 belowand if you critical main documentary viewpoint , you may welcome fact supplemental material largely unedited , running footage devoid any particular viewpoint film authors . this documentary well deserves praise one first approach this subject time when virtually entire western world media would not ( or could not ) go near this topic . when national fever high any questioning war effort considered " treason , " " unpatriotic , " " morally wrong ; " our constitutional rights such free speech free assembly serious danger . documentary portrays this , but ( unfortunately ) only sidelight fashion ( one many problems ) . fact , i'm not sure filmmakers realized this one greatest overriding issues . if common citizens better informed , insane actions atrocities would never happened . yet , documentary displays this serious , national problem absentee press graphically without any possible misinterpretation . both within us other parts world , censorship denial taking place . but it doesn't make points strongly or clearly enough . because this film its issues seen now tens millions , it part our culture effect growing . dismiss it without seeing it its entirety ( plus supplemental materials ! ) going cast doubt anyone who tries discuss documentary but doesn't know firsthand how information presented . basically , you can't attack documentary ideas unless you watch documentary . hearing it your uncle or coworker not acceptable working knowledge . furthermore , since these gigantic political life-threatening issues , every citizen duty informed possible . we can't country goes war , invades 2 other countries , kills permanently maims tens thousands its own soldiers tens thousands citizens other countries , puts 20,000 + jail six+ years , commits acts torture thousands , then substantial part its own population refuse consider this right or wrong , refuses spend 2 hours their time watching easily available documentary might shed new light or viewpoints this situation . said , michael moore his filmmaking team documentary skills decisions sometimes good , but other times quite poor . this documentary several problems , these nothing facts correct or other content issues ; this strictly documentary filmmaking * process * decisions made creation this work . -- big problem #1 : if you film titled " fahrenheit 9/11 " , don't start film discussing presidential election questions and/or irregularities . any filmmaker knows every minute , every second , their footage precious , especially first 10 minutes . documentary our nationwide election problems just fine . but that documentary ; maybe really good one , but i don't think it should included , except perhaps end . starting off material not directly related 9/11 attacks , mr. moore given his critics ample fodder criticism rejection beginning , even if reason rejection flaws . this decision huge presentation blunder , stole precious resources could used set up structure rest material , prepare audience what ahead . its final form , this information irrelevant next 90 minutes barely remembered after it all over . -- big problem #2 : mentioned above , filmmakers not appear good grasp subjects they documenting , there no strong sense what important what not . results missed opportunities , barrage information , lack clarity . information not well organized , it not summarized or reviewed times when new viewer needs time catch their breath . this problem editing pacing ; understanding how viewer or audience mentally keep track everything . doesn't mean material incorrect or faulty , it means it assembled presented poorly . comparison , i'd say it like reading book starting last chapter , then backing up one chapter time . sure , you read book all words , but people , information , story , connections going lot harder put together kind approach . we see lot really important information . there no doubt . but what most important points ? you might name 3 , but someone else might name 3 completely different ones . both would right ! however , this shouldn't happen if documentary well made . -- big problem #3 : film doesn't possess good structure . it not particularly linear piece , neither it follow several simultaneous information or storylines . it doesn't " scientific " approach or any other good format . instead it assembly line data but fails add up finished product , following this analogy , some information falls off assembly line easily forgotten . again , this doesn't mean data wrong , this mistake filmmaking ; all fairness , it sort mistake one would expect someone not well skilled creating documentaries . it not amateur , but it not tight coherent either . material both dense emotionally explosive , hard digest , especially if you aren't familiar all facts . but presentation doesn't work help viewer through this , connect many pieces information or give time pause review . instead , presentation relentless zigzag structure which takes away power material rather than combine it something stronger . instance , we see critically important censorship denial part media , but it not brought into sharp mental focus amongst all other information data , neither implications this media black hole . this needed stronger , more focused presentation . great crime war " freedom " denied " freedom press " very likely lost many viewers . add this seemingly never-ending series musical jokes segments , which i can't even guess their purpose . here we watching this [ literally ] deadly serious material , suddenly we silly rock music images , like some low-grade music video . this type decision truly amateur pathetic ; just shameful people joked . if documentary filmmakers don't treat subject seriousness , how they ridicule other people ? but this documentary shouldn't jokes . fact , no " true documentary " would ever take this lunatic approach , this behavior easily opens up entire subject ridicule . it incomprehensible how any documentary would created this type approach . shame producers , distributors , anyone else involved production not stepping forward " telling emperor he no clothes . " this juvenile , dimwit approach disgraces production insults everyone who suffered craziness " fahrenheit 9/11 " . this should never happened . -- big problem #4 : every moment film should runaway crazy " fahrenheit 9/11 , " but it isn't . example , president bush bangs podium exclaims usual nonsense terrorists hating freedom hating american goodwill . so why not show real reasons ? like fact united states sold arms iran iraq they fought each other years ago , creating immense hostility throughout middle east towards us ? little information , either remind or inform viewer real reasons hatred goes long way proving how we received endless stream lies misleading information entire situation . better yet , since you doing documentary , why not ask variety experts subject , them explain agree or disagree " terrorists hate america freedom " . instead , precious moments documentary stolen largely dead or irrelevant material , such when michael moore stands outside saudi embassy secret service coming ask questions . it interesting , but belongs supplemental materials section . not something qualifies national hysteria or " fahrenheit 9/11 " . it opens both michael moore his entire team criticisms grandstanding trying performers part story instead good documentary filmmakers . here one most important things you should know : original film documentary , we see us military raid civilian home suspected harbor terrorists my utter dismay , we see supplemental materials this part much larger story 10 times much impact , disgusting , barbaric outrageous disrespect ordinary citizens our soldiers . unfortunately this lost jumbled original cut . swedish reporter us military unit tells us no one , including swedish media , would present this shocking horrifying behavior . furthermore , only supplemental material lets us idea type documentary footage michael moore his team work . this well-documented sequence swedish journalists , we see one our military units invade ordinary family home our soldiers physically mentally abusing terrorizing ordinary citizens , including tormenting crippled old man . apparently they didn't understand its importance . then ! ... we find out one soldiers drunk , soldiers hit old man penis repeatedly , this all happens commanding officer watching calmly side . why earth wasn't this included main documentary ? this isn't bad abu ghraib torture sessions , but it dynamite material nevertheless . then we told this not anything unusual ; fact it commonplace ! showing our military behaving like this extremely important footage , shows why people iraq middle eastern world learned hate united states more more each year . yet , this crucial segment poorly presented largely lost original documentary . compared some segments mentioned above , this clearly more important . but , it cast aside . i cannot understand this . it hard speculate , but if this left out , we ask ourselves what other material discarded ? this , unfortunately , just plain bad decision-making documentary process , real lack comprehension part documentary filmmakers ; poor workmanship compared other documentary work . -- final thoughts : this point you may think my opinion documentary poor maybe not worth viewing , so let me avoid film mistake summarize this : this exceedingly serious important documentary , i recommend it supplemental materials anyone who considers himself good american , moral conscience , or anyone who interest american politics actions . you don't agree but you should familiar material see all i t.t hat why it gets 5 stars . you need watch this . however , i'm very critical documentary skill , or lack thereof , much better threfore less controversial documentary could created same materials , might more positive impact received wider acceptance . even so , this needs seen . if you confused how i give five stars something this many problems , let me repeat just delving into this subject national , political environment time its release breakthrough revolutionary . it would " great " hands others	1
so , i saw this movie once ... it guy it ... guy who always grey hair ... it julia roberts . first off ... i want make two things very very clear . if not one specific scene ... i would given this movie one star . so , anyway , it movie this guy who falls love this girl , because she really really beautiful self confident , but then he finds out she married this really big fat guy too ... who way way older than her , way richer than he . so then he all broken-hearted .... so then he sort goes through this flower period , where he realizes he wrong he needs sort ... re-birth . he ... he becomes this really amazing sensative guy , travels all over globe search meaning world peace . then , while he feeding starving children africa , he meets girl some swanky hotel where he giving one his peacful speeches . she sees man who he turned into ... so different skinny little boy next door who threw snow balls her way school . least , that what i feel happened inside him . because when he sees her again he feels like different person since last time he met her . he didn't really go africa all , but that what movie trying say ... his heart , become better person her ... he went africa.it really really touching	1

i bought this ( yep , you guessed it ) grocery store , which very clever marketing concept martha part . there only one dvd left . it contained classic recipes chicken , beef , fish , vegetarian other main dishes . if you think you already know how make classic , everyday dishes such meatloaf , think again - because martha variations may put whole new twist your usual standards . her use fresh herbs truly make difference glaze her meatloaf one i hadn't tried before . my family loved it . there also section bloopers ( yes , martha mistakes or mishaps while filming scene - slips , falls , etc ) . there 12 different cupcake variations extra section kitchen tips ( i learned plenty new things this section ) . i admit i looked bloopers section first , intrigued idea actually seeing martha make mistakes .. i only wish there more those . they funny , especially one showing martha pulling x-rated carrot her garden . you'll buy dvd see rest . it very short section , however . then i watched dvd start finish marveled quality production , well how much information packed into this dvd . start finish , each recipe demonstrated clearly . i intend use this one my youngest child because it perfect introduction some classic recipes , roast chicken meatloaf . they may not made way you used making them but one case advantage ... meatloaf recipe far better than my standard version glaze delicious ( aware your oven peculiarities , however , cover top keep glaze burning ; uncover just long enough brown ) . it would best , course , use oven thermometer know your oven actual temperature since 350 one oven may not 350 - those dials may inaccurate . but don't make mistake thinking this only beginning cooks ( although it'd perfect housewarming gift college graduate who just setting up house ) . there plenty new recipes , especially squash casserole which i am dying try my vegetarian friends , after tested it my family getting rave reviews . fact , one nicest sections this dvd vegetarian one . each those recipes looked delicious . martha mother featured some segments pleasant surprise . she martha chat they cook whole atmosphere nice casual . no matter what you may think martha stewart , this dvd top-notch , quality production tons useful info . dvd also inserted computer get list menus other features .	1

this film made brigitte bardot legend . i admit : i tried look this film objectively i find it alternately demeaning , silly , just plain dumb . so how come i'm giving it five stars ? one word : bardot . if you assemble dictionary would use visuals illustrate various words , bardot mambo sequence would authoritatively define word " sensual . " pulsating sound bongos background punctuated blaring horns , brigitte larger than life dancing room room like woman possessed . this may not acting but it sure holds your attention - kind like watching human transform into wild animal . this sequence tells you all you need know why bardot legend even her senior years . no , i don't believe god created woman silly ending which we expected believe few slaps jean louis trintignant enough turn bardot into submissive french housewife . other hand , i don't think audiences 1950 ready deal reality sexually liberated woman like brigitte .	1

ok , get things straight , only reason i ever bought this movies joseph mazzello name front . this actor , always , gives stunning performance , reason u should view this movie . mary elizabeth mastrantonio gives good performance also struggling single mother . script starts really nice promising , some intelligent thoughts combined funny moments , however , time it ends you start wondering what point . end , my opinion ( although maybe i'm way too cynical therefore subjective ) not satisfactory . it clearly addresses child you , it just it address 4 years old child . this after all family movie , one watch your kids nice cozy living room afternoon when there nothing else better . problem i'm not sure kids would really wanna go through first half film ( although u ) time it reaches end , addressing child supposed watch it , u suddenly feel dumb even sticking whole story . however , if u disregard end imagine tom meeting old jack , this movie could quite enjoyable . other problem patrick swayze . now , i haven't seen other movies he starred , but here ... makes me wonder whether he good actor . maybe he just wasn't part , because i can't sence chemistry him ms. mastrantonio , let alone joseph mazzello ( which chemistry film supposed rely upon ) . he just doesn't fit part . but again , if you disregard this also , you draw something out this film . i said it worth buying just this your joseph mazzello collection , because ending scene , 12 years old tom riding bicycle where main character departs , heart-breaking . how 12 year old child ( supposing he 12 then because it looks like ) pull off beyond me . i think we expect great things him . kid plays his brother overall cute , which exactly what he supposed throughout film - make u feel sympathetic towards him , so no objection there . third problem score . quite frankly , stupidest music i've ever heard . so i said if you're fan mr. mazzello get this movie , if not , well then what u waiting , but start something different like cure or simon birch . if you fan mr. swayze ... i ask why ?	1

let it written , this how television ought made . scripted , staged acted apex success sophistication , i never my life lucky enough see anything like quality elizabeth , bbc very fine 1970s miniseries chronicling more well-known aspects life queen elizabeth 1 . set across series six two-hour plays , story follows young protestant princess elizabeth , disowned shut away while her catholic sister mary takes throne . her subsquent release coronation set stage more eventful , treacherous successful aspects rest her reign - her failed romances , her successful campaigns , her would-be asassinations shot down - each captured so beautifully acted so convincingly completely enthrall viewer . glenda jackson magnificent , it rare thing indeed any actress able portray such age range ( sixteen or so well over sixty ) , , excellent makeup effects notwithstanding , it such consistency timing . jackson palpable skill total immersion such expansive archaic role superlative , sets stage series other quite brilliant performances names like vivian pickles mary scotland , stephen murray bloody-minded chauvanistic cardinal walsingham excellent daphne slater ill-fated queen mary 1 . such performances hand , bbc could forgiven staging productions shoestring budget , but happily this not case , historical detail abounds richness costumes , sparseness elizabethan sets overall sense moment history not forgotten modern researchers . where cate blanchett ' elizabeth ' ( excelletn film , too , but simply not this league ! ) flashy lush , contrasting sense lush spartan treatments some visuals ' elizabeth ' creates such sense period it easy forget this simply tv series . but that doing it injustice . ' tv series ' conjures up images pedantic in-jokes convoluted continuity , neither which ' elizabeth ' suffers . terms acting , staging tension , it really ultimate drama , fans tudor elizabethan periods history , it cannot missed . wholeheartedly recommended	1
i've actually hoping live cd release , but i more than happy this dvd . all favorites here ( only minor gripe omission echo 11am , inclusion priceless , but that just personal preference ) . this all evidence needed show this band reached maturity . drive unexpected change , but most played-out song their lineup , obscurity welcome . musical talent all around seems much improved previous dvds , each member gets show off all their new tricks . unlike some other bands , incubus seems perfectly display each musician talents so well each song , this -for me- showed how it all put together so seamlessly . every song highlight this one - my favorites made tv movie sick sad little world . other notes : it perfect place film dvd ; we get see brandon play guitar how well ben works backup singer ; i think jose could make any rock band sound good . recommended any fan incubus , especially their newer material	1

i recently read short obituary paul pena which this documentary mentioned , inspired rent it . what beautiful story it ! not unlike fictional protagonist " schultze gets blues , " paul pena , blind musician living san francisco , fiddling his short-wave radio one day came across some mongolian music which turned out tuvan throat singing , fascinating art form virtually unknown united states . through long exhaustive study ( which included laborious translation songs tuvan russian english , because there no tuvan-english dictionary , using braille ) , pena taught himself this genre mastered art point where he invited travel tuva compete national throat singing competition . film includes delightful cast characters ( " characters " : unique individuals ) who travel pena , fascinating look handsome deeply spiritual tuvan people , who welcomed pena incredible warmth kindness -- point where he actually felt stronger bond them than his community back u.s. truly special film not missed . ps i rate this film five big stars but maybe i goofed amazon program doesn't permit number stars change once review sumbitted	1

during my teenage years i fan wwf wrestling specifically , rock . he tremendous wrestler who fans admired right away because his talent extremely funny microphone cut some funniest , most disgusting lines ever mentioned wwf tv . his talent ring spot-on , rock would always give people everything he when it came time step ring compete . he rarely made mistake ring ... but he made huge mistake stepping away wrestling walking down path hollywood . it not doom really bad movie . sure , it movie considered disappointment right get go because no one wanted watch it movie theaters . it just normal , monster-shooting film delivers tiny amount suspense , that it . i'm sure movie would've big it released 10 years ago . todays generation probably sick go-nowhere do-nothing action films such doom . okay , so it go somewhere , but film isn't really designed build awe-inspiring creative story . doom kind movie you don't really want seek out- you just happen come across it video store decide you need quick 90-minute action fix , so you rent movie , watch it , then forget it next morning . course , i'm sure you don't forget rewind tape because that impolite . rock never should left wrestling . it bad career move millions wrestling fans ( rock means millions ) really miss him . come back home , rock . please	1

we bought this installment " disney treasures " series when it released late 2005 . my 9 year old son i just watched these cartoons again ( oct . 2006 ) we both love them . i would agree , however , those reviewers who noted visually cartoons this vol . 2 " chronological donald " not restored same degree perfection those earlier releases , including vol . 1 " chronological donald " release containing many donald world war ii cartoons entitled " front lines " . there clear difference quality , which apparent when donald cartoons previously released " front lines " repeated this collection compared cartoons new here . former visually superior , not because they better begin , but because they more carefully restored transferred . this shame . one hopes chronological donald vol 3 ( apparently not released 2006 , but perhaps 2007 ) there return quality vol . 1 " front lines .

i havent gotten really , really good angry movie long time , course , it took film like troy remind me what it like . let me start saying if your idea good time brad pitt orlando bloom slightly misted sweat looking pretty , then turn sound down , grab bowl popcorn all means , enjoy this movie beautiful costuming , ignore rest this review . but , if you expect even one iota more out movie ..... dont waste your time .... i'm saddened fact i cant get 2 hours 40 some odd minutes my life i wasted here back . dialogue insipid ( they actually left line , " i'm sorry sir .... your wife left trojans . " film .... ) , everyone speaks british accent , except brad pitt .... which wouldn't bad if he wasnt star film . then there extras who play sailors .... who reasons i cant quite understand seem speaking greek .... when rest greeks speaking english british accent .... well ... except brad pitt . one scene , achilles ( pitt ) his cousin (?) sparr swords among majestic greek ruins next beautiful blue sea .... i actually hit pause scream screen , " idiots !!! it would building then ! not ruins ! " . real trojan war lasted over ten years .... this filmed version appears last two weeks ... days break here there allow main characters look suitably attractive beach ... you very little if any idea loss life each side .... short , this movie pure unadulterated drivel . youre asked care what began war ( you don't ) , you're asked believe brad pitt achilles smoldering brooding ( you can't ) , youre expected come away knowledge thousands years this considered greatest war all time ( you won't ) . however much spent making this film wasted .	-1
when i first saw this little film , it aired comedy central none fanfare it should received since it initial release . fact , office space reached cult status reason . it funny , witty , always makes you laugh . cast includes jennifer aniston supporting role waitress/girlfriend ron livingston character who epiphany during group therapy session . alex wentworth plays his girlfriend her shorter role . anyway , i don't remember man who plays arab employee friend ron character but he should applauded his role . newsradio stephen root should his own sitcom his performance milton , poor picked employee who reaches breaking point film . diedrich bader plays neighbor next door who offers wisdom ron character film . mad tv alum gregory herman plays colleague computer geek . mad tv alum orlando jones plays guy selling magazines door door . he turns out not person you think he . gary cole memorable performance boss who thinks he knows it all but doesn't know anything . movies like office space make me understand what we become those us office . imagine , if we just didn't work anymore . would heaven me	1
i'm those who saw this sundance , all things i enjoy gaiman mckean graphic novels display : quiet humor , intelligence , delightful weirdness , astounding visual vocabulary . except this case , words spoken good actors , all those visuals get up off their feet move . it hard describe impact watching mckean painting move talk . there might those who quibble movie looking too " animated , " but course that exactly point : create world make it dance . end result , visually least , like nothing you've ever seen before , absolutely worth seeing reason alone . some people i talked after screening also loved visuals but felt story bit dull , they seen it all before . well , it true story wear its influences its sleeve -- little " alice wonderland " here , little " time bandits " there , lot " wizard oz " over here , not mention resemblance gaiman own " coraline . " but i'm just familiar those stories anyone else , resemblances never interrupted my enjoyment " mirrorrmask " -- after all , it what you story determines its success . moment moment , there enough innovation cleverness , enough delight wonder , make movie positive delight . when movie came out theaters i went see it again , there little girl six years old row ahead me who sat through whole thing eyes agog ; then friend mine tried show dvd her young son but he got completely creeped out spider-thingie . ( hey , " wizard oz " moment when witch appears crystal ball exactly same effect me -- yet it lingered memory , when i got older i drawn back fell love movie . that how this stuff works . ) " mirrormask " probably little too wild full-out commercial success ; but i bet it going long , long shelf life dvd people pull it out tell their friends " wait till you see this .	1

i saw this movie twice theaters now dvd , each time it becomes more funny . if you high school graduate 90 , you wave flashbacks brought just music alone . full all high school sterotypes , popular group , jocks , cheerleaders , " nerds " , outcasts , i find this very easy fall into high school rut again . brief synopsis : this story once chubby high school boy ( played ryan reynolds ) who day graduation wants profess his love his best friend ( played amy smart ) . they known each other since 6th grade , always " just friends " , but he now wants more . he writes his confession his yearbook , which accidently gets switched before he give it her . unfortunately , one school bullies it reads it front whole senior class . this sends ryan reynolds running house , new jersey 10 years . he moves california , becomes wealthy popular , player , all based rules this break-up . happenstance , pr stint worlds most annoying pop star ( paris hilton like ) , he gets stranded his home town christmas holidays , he left re-connecting his old friends , feels he something prove . he want show amy smart she missing out him , but through missadventures , falls back into " friendzone " . watch this movie , see if he able show everyone he now mr. cool , or see if he fall flat his face no friends again . all all , very worth purchase price , funny clever , alternate endings dvd funny also , could worked , behind scenes enlightening . must all folks . ryan reynolds excellent job this flick , playing his own normal corny self , bit humbleness .	1

this kurosawa fist use widescreen , it looks glorious . while he managed simulate wider shots his past films academy aspect ratio , this , rife innumerable extras epic landscape , just awesome spectacle . like all good kurosawa though , story simple , elemental , yet definitive . two peasants/thieves absolute riot , mifune comes across amazing presence ... fantastically usual . criterion film justice excellent transfer , but little way supplementary material , especially when compared recent releases -- introduction george lucas this disk great though . price this disk , lack audio commentary , etc ... unfortunate . truly character driven story , film boasts people crass , yet lovable . not concerned apocalypse like kurosawa some previous later works , hidden fortress offers rousing adventure , which encapsulates classic story telling its stylistic best . such , this one favorites my personal kurosawa collection .	1
i saw last half hour this movie bravo network last week when i actually looking rerun " project runway , " so my first exposure it segment k-mart interview charlton heston . wow . i ended up grateful " project runway " wasn't . i made sure catch " bowling columbine " when bravo ran it again , so i could see whole thing . they showed it again last night . i say here , prior this , i'd never seen anything michael moore ( except one episode " tv nation " ) never interest seeing any his films because all negative things i'd heard , including things moore fans raved i thought negative , such way moore confronts people his films . what surprised me " bowling columbine " what came across me michael moore compassion . i really got sense he cared very deeply people who lost their lives through gun violence well people who lived unfortunate circumstances . i much greater respect him than i before i saw film . his motivating factor doesn't seem me so much political moral . he truly moralist . he reminds me abolitionists nineteenth century way .

2 fast 2 furious one those sequels comes around every so often doesn't require you seen original . i saw this movie first time not too long after it came out , never seen original , i thought i would lost wouldn't enjoy myself much other people , but contrary - i left experience much happier than when i came . this film full quick one-liners deserve laugh . special effects car races leave your mouth gaping open . i heard read people didn't appreciate this film much because it seemed focus more plot than first film rather than focus more races , but overall , i think balance works well . even thinking plot we left , i really can't see time when race would even appropriate . people saying this film worse than original , i would disagree ... why ? frankly , i always firm believer than vin diesel entirely overrated actor . ( i mean , c'mon - you seen pacifier ? ) he nothing more than meat head who , while able pretty good fight scenes , should leave dialogue someone else . yes , this film younger crowd , there numerous occasions when unbelievable events take place ( take boat jumping example ) , but there no saying older person wouldn't enjoy it well ... only thing i say you really shouldn't go into this film expecting oscar worthy performance , or else you disappointed . if you sit back take this fun romp it , however , you thoroughly enjoy yourself	1
i really enjoyed this movie . it may not amazing , but it funny just deep enough pull you . it one those movies i like watch when i'm sick because it just makes you feel good	1

there not lot you need know thank you smoking , except it gleefully jaundiced , well-nigh perfectly paced adaptation christopher buckley novel . teacher who used lead class critical thinking , i took particular pleasure witty " spins " glib lobbyist nick naylor treats us he advocates big tobacco . sidelight : not one person this film actually smokes cigarette . special shout-outs excellent supporting actors david koechner ( gun advocate bobby jay bliss ) j.k. simmons ( budd " b.r.

i saw this long time ago showcase channel , heard it through local tv-guide-ish magazine . man , i blown away quality beauty this film . it man who one day claims he son god he bringing second coming . first nobody believes him , but then he starts performing miracles , people start realising this might real deal . i won't ruin ending ( it your job watch it ! ;) ) but part gets me every time . it true piece work , film deserves much more loving . it definitely worth your time	1

it good season worth owning . i assume you already know this if you reading this . dvd set presented good sound , picture quality etc ..... however .... i really disappointed see warner bros . cheaped out english subtitles this time around . seasons 2-4 awesome watch subtitles hard hearing , it really helped comprehension all medical jargon spewed out 100 miles hour . medical professional myself , i got lot out this " special " feature . my fiancee , who not medical professional , found she able get lot more out show watching subtitles well . it definitely helps viewer appreciate complexity show writing . show still great . however , it inexplicable why we wait 7 months this dvd set come out when they obviously didn't put much work into it previous sets ( ie . they didn't want pay someone transcribe scripts sync subtitles ) . this especially irksome considering season 5 available dvd uk quite long while now . i just assumed warner bros . spending extra time cash job right north america . i wrong	1
i leave it others , better it than i am , detail story , actors , hollywood behind this wonderful film . what i need you understand film central theme , life handed us society , life we programmed into accepting unquestioningly unreflectingly one big fraud , more relevant today than ever . this film , more than any other , dares ask right question shows us one man search one right answer . it search tyrone power character begins himself , concludes world filled friends who live falsely rather than truly , chosen illusion happiness over truth possibility despair . take journey him ... you won't disappointed . life tirelessly struggling wealth , power , fame , pleasure cannot help us achieve real happiness , even though rule over us name order organization , structures society must their best convince us it . answer question , why we behave we , live we , got more than what we told almost moment birth ... why not . this film says , living good life , happy life means walking edge , walking tightrope illusion truth . we never hope get all way across , but , like any real-life tightrope , stop means perish .	1

personally , i don't think i would resort murder , but four brothers this movie there no doubt how far they would go . set off police force lack effort ( their eyes ) finding their adoptive mother killer , four brothers take vigilante justice whole new level . nearly lost plot killing , corruption revenge though story family , loyalty love , even respect ( woman who raised them mostly ) . i touched their thanksgiving meal where they each saw her , except bobby , who finally saw her end . josh charles plays smarmy , dirty cop ( like he swat ) garrett hedlund amazing job troubled , youngest brother who tries so hard make older ones proud . well piece singleton sure , it could set any large city but he picked detroit . interesting . this movie very gritty violent , but i drawn right everytime i thought i it figured out there twist	1

almost everything this movie bad . writing side , there no plot , no theme , no characterisation . it like first , very rough draft , everyone involved convinced themselves so brilliant it didn't need re-working . it impossible tell , example , if father meant brilliant but fading , or just rather stupid impostor . he constantly makes references literary works he believes valid , he teaches creative writing , but none his comments any intrinsic value : it just what he personally likes or dislikes . so we're left wondering if we're supposed see him pathetic literary snob or guy who right . quite possibly , this confusion caused writer this film similar position . much this film like ' wonder boys ' without charm , humour , humanity , surprise interesting dialogue . it classic example how up its own arse so much artsy film-making . plot faults abound , e.g. others already pointed out absurdity entire audience not heard pink floyd song plagiarised son . morality making such young actor say stuff he shouldn't . . . . this country ( uk ) , we double-standards this sort thing , it looks like us may too . instance , here press slaughtered , continues so , gary glitter , pop star who found thousands pictures child porn his computer . rightly , his career ended overnight , press continued pursue him . contrast benjamin britten , classical composer . bb liked young , under-age , boys ; he wooed them , took them holidays him one case least , sexually abused victim point ruining his life . but his music still played , his reputation intact . fact , he recently book written him which writer ' explains ' his child-abusing not really all , because bb day it seen more companion/mentor kind thing . this film good example how double standards apply , both morally artistically , under banner ' art ' . but fact , it boring , witless , unrealistic , morally suspect , piece work whose only saving grace it short .	-1
george sluizer original dutch-french version vanishing ( aka man who wanted know ) offers one european cinema most quietly disturbingly anonymous everyday sociopaths , feeling his way one step time towards murder . if you've seen version , you probably still can't get final revelation out your head , but film plenty more offer than , playing chronology , subverting usual cliches its ' lady vanishes ' plot ( hero wants know what happened his missing lover far more than he wants her alive ) throwing some excellent characterization . i only assume this 1993 us remake sluizer so determined o-o ne else going get chance ruin his film when he perfectly capable doing it himself , but few people could anticipated how comprehensively he trashes his own work . his career never recovered . chief culprit astonishing performance jeff bridges overthought through every detail truly disastrous level . friend who produced one his earliest movies noted bridges great instinctive actor long you stopped him thinking what he doing , this film proof pudding . every movement overly mechanical its precision , making him look like rusty clockwork toy , while his voice bizarre mixture tootsie , latka gravas taxi dalek who all taking elocution lessons dok-tah e-ville . no banality evil here , just looney walking around invisible sign over his head saying " please . let . me . kill . you . thank you . your . consideration . ' but blame really needs shared out here . none performances good : often , they don't even look good - keifer sutherland looks more like baby hamster than distraught man his wits end hurried scenes gas station , nancy travis flounders badly sandra bullock makes no impression all object his obsession . not they're given any help either director or writer todd graff . script particularly weak . chronology altered put focus firmly bridges expense couple opening film . worse rush film , draining life character each scene its race get next . rather than high/low mood shifts couple relationship or apparently casual but careful establishing feel location , we just get couple arguments give you impression he probably better off without her . new improved happy ending - standard woman chased nutter woods jeopardy stuff complete lame `let end joke like tv cop show ' moment - best not go there ... which advice holds this entire trainwreck movie . even shockingly bland uninspired jerry goldsmith score can't anything this one .	-1
alan alda must feel blessed such integral part two greatest shows television history . creative forces behind west wing gathered their collective strengths gave series ending it deserved . decades now i'll pulling out these discs watching them . horror sadness we learned last december john spencer suddenly passed . west wing fans grieved sent their prayers behalf mr. spencer those who actually known loved him . we see some love respect gets translated show episodes swirl around leo death among most heart-breaking i've ever seen screen . when kristin chenoweth annabeth tells bradley whitford josh leo died her tears didn't look all like " acting " . same said expressions faces all actors leo funeral , ending martin sheen president bartle t.t he storyline this season centers presidential race jimmy smits portraying congressman matt santos against alda senator arnold vinick . this ticket clearly fantasy liberal writers even republican candidate pro-choice , insults some nra-type vigilantes all but thumbs his nose religious right . vinick campaign derailed somewhat aftermath nuclear accident california particularly shrewish right-winger brought help senator woo back republican base . ron silver continues his role bruno gianelli , political strategist who only cares winning - knows how it . patricia richardson effective vinick assistant who tries keep him track . janeane garofalo serves sparring partner josh lou , democratic operative who gets almost much pleasure seeing josh flounder ( which he inevitably brief moments ) helping her political causes . teri polo plays helen - candidate santos ' wife - this character always seems little less enthusiastic than would appropriate wife man who may become president . aside sensitive respectful way real-life death john spencer worked into fictional story , this season gets few other things right . where we may frustrated past lack love lives most these characters years - all service their country - this season we get see most principal characters hook up one way or . first daughter ellie gets married white house ceremony curiously missing both her sisters . ( although all three daughters make leo funeral . ) through their own obvious attraction donna persistence josh donna finally get together . opening first episode we're glad see flashback c.j. danny concannon married child , other episodes we get see danny gentle courting techniques one most powerful ( powerfully nice ) women world . it also gratifying see some " old friends " show up final episodes such rob lowe return sam seaborn . ( sam recruited duty josh scene pays homage earlier flashback scene season two when josh conscripts sam first " bartlet america " campaign . ) shows writers , directors , actors , professionals who shot , set costumed show : bravo ! i'll miss you dearly watch these shows enduring pleasure . pinheads who decided release these dvds without any significant extras : pox your houses . while first seasons came full sets subtitles , documentaries commentary tracks which performers , directors creators couldn't withhold their obvious glee - this season comes next nothing . first seasons came subtitles english , francais espanol . last two seasons not option english subtitles . what if viewer hard hearing ? what reason these deficiencies ? laziness ? complacency ? no doubt almighty dollar played major role . this show - this show fans - deserved better . rest well-deserved honored peace , john spencer . adieu , west wing .	1

i dont know what its like gone school 1980 or gone school united states but i still relate this movie . this movie could set anywhere any decade it would still tell same story , only fashion accessories would different . everyone seen this movie now everyone opinion it most say it really good movie . i would say it deserves called classic now . it may not laugh out loud comedy or very dramatic move little slow times , but it delivers its message loud clear keeps you engaged throughout whole movie . it gains momentum it moves end , after experiencing all emotiions you feel satisfied . small cast , all your attention focused individual characters . 5 students all completely different one all brilliant . each actor plays their part perfectly . while there large age gap them they all convincing teenagers fighting there own demons . they all probably most remembered this movie , exception emilio estevez , but special mention must go judd nelson who i believe biggest star film . his part originally intended either nicholas cage or john cusack who would also great , but i'm glad judd got his chance prove his acting capabilities . it shame dvd lacks many special features . all you get trailer cast bios , i desperately seeking audio commentary , or very least production notes , however there some interesting facts noted imdb . teen movie 80 generation , anyone born after film made probably not like it , but others who grew up around or just after it probably agree this movie indeed classic . 7.5 /1	1
viewing series 3 , i struck how well producers targeted all three series late 20th-century-middle-class-working-woman-viewer . house elliott all work problems : establishing career insufficient formal credentials , working man world , finding out who you trust business , working people you dislike who nonetheless valuable contributors business , supervising people who dislike each other , hit male coworkers business associates , juggling your demanding career often conflicting demands husband or boyfriend , juggling motherhood work , dealing creatively work emergencies . series 3 , lower-class working conditions , socialism potential solution , major new themes . there also more emphasis demands motherhood ( bea tilly babies ) previously minor characters , especially home lives house elliott employees . pace frenetic compared first two series , lots multiple plot lines quick shifts back forth them , unnecessarily dramatic camera angles , dropped situations , overall too much going . all characters make major life some cases personality shifts . tilly becomes clinically depressed . bea new boyfriend daniel rapidly evolves arrogant , callous , resentful , self-centered , exploitative jerk ( he even gigolo ) sensitive , caring guy who makes major sacrifices evie . evie rejected boyfriend miles apparently turns sweet , caring , sensitive , generous guy shark trying take over house elliott . this really science fiction series where their brains got swapped night ? every single one plots ends up cliffhanger . tilly norm become employed again ? agnes leave house elliott become full-time music hall singer ? jack succeed his new career socialist politician , bea able cope politician wife ? donald happy all sacrifices he made bea ? miles end up running house elliott ? many more . . . but most all , new rift bea evie ( who throughout this show always closer each other than any husband or boyfriend ) ever heal ? stay tuned series 4 : except , far i tell , there wasn't one . nonetheless , fans series 1 2 certainly want watch series 3 . oh , clothes great	1

you tell header , i disappointed this movie . since kurt russell plays lead , i should not surprised , because parts he plays generally rather predictable simplistic ( tango cash , snake plisskin , etc ) . i just don't picture kurt lead actor gritty , realistic drama ... but , eternally optimist , i hoped this might exception . it wasn't . story involves two la detectives , one grizzled thoroughly corrupt veteran ( russell ) other somewhat principled but weak-willed easily manipulated rookie , bobby keough ( scott speedman ) . russell character ( eldon perry ) controlled protected exceedingly corrupt superior officer , jack van meter ( nicely played brendan gleeson ) , who uses perry further his profitable flagrantly illegal interests . if you ever watched " shield " fx cable network then you familiar this general setup .... morally ambiguous detective used further his superior agenda ..... but here problem : shield ( television series ) vastly superior every way : plot , acting , characterization , dialog , direction , etc . this feature film . it like comparing filet mignon cheap hamburger . once you see quality , nuanced drama like shield , this movie all like it rendered unwatchable . characters dark blue caricatures almost no depth . they guzzle whiskey laugh their flagrant crimes . plot dialog contrived unrealistic . there no subtlety .... no intellectually stimulating complexity . eldon always exactly he told : if mass-murdering thugs ( employed protected his superior ) sheltered arrest , simply go out murder couple stray ex-cons let them take rap ( posthumously ) real criminals . never mind neither ex-cons even close plausible suspect . no one would fooled this ruse , except perhaps this mindless movie . eldon gets his partner keough perform one cold-blooded murders ordered van meter , thus begins their downfall , because keough spontaneous change heart suddenly cannot accept guilt his actions . one minute he guzzling whiskey his cronies laughing lying shooting review board , next he overwrought guilt . not all likely real life , but it suits plot . things gets even sillier when partner ( speedman ) then teams up assistant chief ( ving rhames ) predictably beautiful ex-mistress ( michael michelle ) try arrest real thugs use them bring down whole perverted mess . heaven forbid he simply come forth provide evidence accomplish this end . what follows lengthy , confused , poorly choreographed pursuit thugs predictable gun battle equally predictable outcome . ultimate farce , however , reserved eldon himself , who drives around south central los angeles during peak rodney king riots trying find arrest black suspect .... which he easily accomplishes .... then drives away without scratch . this reaches level surrealistic absurdity insult true horror riots . equally unconvincing eldon spontaneous change heart end movie , during his promotion ceremony ( such irony ) , when he delivers rambling , preposterous unconvincing indictment his father , himself , his evil superior .... which simplistically immediately accepted ( true movie fashion ) all who hear it , who then immediately jump arrest condemn naughty superior . this silly , implausible , insult any viewer above age ( maturity ) 10-year old . jump up your next promotion ceremony deliver rambling condemnation your superior see what happens . this type naive nonsense occurs only one place : movies .... bad ones . if you thrilled tango cash , thought snake plissken brilliantly-portrayed anti-hero , then all means hit " buy it now " button this dvd . but , if you want complexity , subtlety , realism , plausibility , infinitely superior acting , plot , characterization , direction .... yourself huge favor use your money either subscribe fx cable , or buy/rent dvd shield series .... filet mignon always better than cheap hamburger	1
some might suggest there now three things not discuss polite conversation : 1 ) politics 2 ) religion 3 ) viet nam . viet nam , battle would become known hamburger hill resulted over ninety per cent one american platoon dead . yet body count would still necessary see which side suffered greater losses . directing mass charges via waves infantry modern warfare initially chronicled during korean conflict only later officially recognized ' war ' . importantly , hamburger hill also battle before it made into movie also war named but never declared . overview , modern war , film-making or army life , " we soldiers " merits full consideration . mel gibson turns flawless performance walking point this sortie became first major battle viet nam conflict , later unofficially entitled " war .

all many many documentaries recounting despicable acts mass murder committed name allah day , this far most comprehensive most unflinching . because this , those whose mindsets side more terrorists find this factual documentary somewhat distressing its raw recitation events . perhaps none more so than " caesar " his review sept . 17 , 2006 . if only he found least troubling carnage , bloodshed , destruction deliberately perpetrated his islamic buddies against civilian populations . but , more this bit . regards this extraordinary video , perspectives air traffic controllers , faa officials , norad neads , air crews passengers board each four doomed flights , testimonies witnesses , participants , firefighters , all heroes near ground zero , this singular documentary takes you minute minute through hell deliberately planned perpetrated those whose religion them believing execution such hellish bloodshed granted them virgin-laden heaven . ( no ... this not " propaganda " or view documentary , but instead my own conclusions drawn many years personal investigation islam ) . anyone who , like " caesar " here , could watch this fully factual account then call such splendid documentary " goody-goody propaganda " " try(ing ) portray us good guys hit bad guys ... " reveals instead either their rabid religious fanaticism or otherwise their own anti-american hatred so apparently condoning such ghastly blood-soaked horrors acts " good guys " retaliating against " bad guys . " while " caesar " ( how telling nickname ) attempts school us ignorant americans our country past political-policy foibles , yet he fails mention billions financial economic aid we given islamic nations , millions military equipment technical advisory assistance provided them they struggled against invading soviet forces and/or other foreign enemies attempting annex rule over sovereign islamic nations , ousting kuwait brutal armed forces islamic fascist dictator who invaded then " enjoyed " weeks metaphoric all too literal raping this tiny islamic nation while openly looting , terrorizing , butchering , torturing , murdering its citizens while none its islamic neighbors lifted so much finger intervene , but instead begged united nations u.s. solve their problems them ... which we ! these just tiny listing far greater acts we cause justice good , all it islam behalf . yet , 9/11 only latest greatest terrorist massacre which we continue repaid bloodthirsty religion islam all we continue its behalf . " caesar " also glaringly omits all too conveniently ignores radical islam blood-soaked history their on-going policy religiously motivated bomb blasts , hijackings , kidnappings , tortures , rapes , gang rapes , female circumcisions , sawing and/or hacking off people limbs heads , mutilations , always ... mass murder after mass murder after yet more mass murder all perpetrated against civilian populations worldwide , including those their own religion , all thanks islam foundational tenets blood lust makes all such horrors not only acceptable but actually laudable , eternally rewardable , thus ... forever inevitable . true , all religions their radicals fanatics . but none deliberately attract , nurture , encourage terrorist fanatics more than islam . none preaches genocide against entire jewish race/nation all non-islamic " infidels " name god more than islam . it how this video accurately documents entire world only this latest greatest mass butchery name allah probably motivates " caesar " most attempt such blatant anti- u.s. propagandizing here . those who would disagree , i challenge " caesar " or anyone else provide us any reliable evidence even single factual error this documentary . what i think " caesar " fears most such powerful documentary this might add growing world view despite constant rhetoric islam religion " peace , " ever-escalating terrorist acts its leaders constituents name islamic religion reveal exact opposite true case . maybe it just me , but i'm thinking any religion so encourages its hormone-driven young men blow themselves up many " infidels " they so spend eternity orgiastic sex 72 virgins deserves fully prosecuted , very least charges " conspiracy commit ( mass ) murder " ! one thought just hit me : if more more islamics continue either commit or condone such bloodshed full approval their islamic leaders , which god they truly honoring emulating : allah -- creator life ; or instead , iblis ( satan ) , destroyer it ? their fruits they known , after all . question whom what islamics most worship adore , permit me close this review also this wonderful documentary , quoting one islam most renowned clerics : " we love death . u.s. loves life . big difference us .

" if cold , dated , impersonal " different " than i guess they . i would wager many here who give this 5 stars viewed it its original time frame fans all , though i must say looking this outside , it quite honestly , train-wreck . i feeling show " could " get better but i won't around reset tracks	-1

movie starts off very slowly , childhood episodes ashton kutcher character . it least 1/2 hour before we see adult kutcher , although he appear very beginning brief scene . premise good , it some good momentum middle , which why i gave it two stars . shifting situations his life lives his friends interesting well , but overall story line very weak , ending dreadful not supported most rest story . also , movie too many tongue-in-cheek references kutcher real life circumstances -- such reference " tighty-whities . " they distract story , make movie more vanity vehicle -- which too bad -- if you not kutcher convert just looking movie , skip this one	1

" philosophers often behave like little children who scribble some marks piece paper random then ask grown-up , ' what ? '" - ludwig wittgensteinimagine spending hour half teenage version sphynx " mystery men , " but without mr. furious foil . instead , there somewhat compassionate , somewhat opportunistic pearl madison , played don cheadle . sometimes i wasn't sure if cheadle doing really good job playing someone who conflicted , or if his regret signing up this film bleeding through screen . film similar " mystery men " way , though ; filmmakers assembled talented production crew , cast some my favorite actors ( including kevin spacey -- also one film prodcuers ) put them one most frustrating films i've ever sat through . i guess i'm just really tired small movies suburban life fey , disembodied narrators spouting out random aphorisms non sequitors . i wouldn't mind so much if film able deliver some sort epiphany , but it doesn't . when credits rolled , only thing i thinking guy who'd stabbed his girlfriend retarded brother , writer/director matthew hoge asking , " what ? " i may well watched " elephant " again . if exploring suburban angst your thing , you might like this film . there better cooked stories out there , though . i watched larry clark " ken park " afterward , which like " united states leland " less wealthy neighborhood . both films depressing , but i felt so gross after i watched " ken park " i promptly returned it video store , showered cleaned my whole apartment . least i shocked into action . " united states leland " just me crawling back into bed . soundtrack okay . score sunny day real estate jeremy enigk . jena malone shoots up heroin pixies , there dot allison song i like credits i'd forgotten . no cd released .	-1
this smart , well-crafted heist movie , which i enjoyed much more than earlier heist ( which just too overly self-consciously clever all back-up plans odd dialog ) . three main actors , brando , norton , de niro all turn exemplary performances , probably one only time all three ever worked togegther . watching de niro use all his safe-cracking skills fascinating , something most us probably know nothing . after all , one doesn't meet high-level safe-crackers every day . :-) safe-cracking scene thermal torch made some spectacular cinematography what all sparks , way de niro figures out how open safe so quickly inspired . commentary dvd , they mention that way it actually happened when they filmed it , it spectacular scene , but i won't say anything more so not spoil it you . but you'll see what i mean when you come it . ending also surprise , unobstrusive musical score adds drama some nice mood touches where they're appropriate . overall good flick worth your time money	1
there few more beatific images than youthful ingrid bergman framed her nun habit , looking skyward glistening candlelight end this 1945 holiday classic . director leo mccarey bing crosby reprise his role father o'malley their film year earlier , " going my way " . both really reflect type films would more likely show up tv movies family channel if produced today , but wartime audiences obviously need such cinematic salves . what reassuring how films remain affecting today if rather unabashedly sentimental . what sets this one apart crosby natural ease role ( certainly far more muted than he bob hope road movies ) incandescent bergman portray sister benedict . pacing leisurely , first part film establishes two stars their roles before going into slim plotline , which sister hoping rich curmudgeon named horace . bogardus donate new , expansive building st. mary academy take place rundown old building sisters schoolchildren inhabit . mccarey - screenwriter dudley nichols - both pioneers screwball comedy , focus lightheartedness story until couple sentimental developments occur . first lonely student named patsy , who comes idolize sister benedict , point intentionally failing graduate order avoid going back home her concerned mother estranged father . second involves sister benedict medical condition which forces father o'malley make difficult decision st. mary . there fewer songs here than " going my way " - title tune one , " aren't you glad you're you ? " , both sung effortlessly crosby swedish folk song performed warm alto bergman . soft-centered philosophical discussions two leads generate some interesting conflict though nothing feels irreconcilable end . there also some amusing scenes well , example , kindergarten class unaffectedly improvising christmas play bergman showing off her pugilistic prowess boy beaten up fight . while i much prefer bergman her more outwardly seductive roles ( " notorious " ) , i see why people wanted so much see her glowing embodiment good during wwii , even though it this image harbinger when she caught extramarital scandal roberto rossellini five years later . crosby always seems playing himself , which this case , good thing . henry travers , forever clarence me frank capra " it wonderful life " , plays bogardus appropriate stubbornness compromised regret , joan carroll , least prominent smith daughters vincente minnelli " meet me st. louis " , gives solid performance conflicted patsy . this understandably well-loved film even if it runs bit too long	1
young white boy growing up navajo reservation very wonderful , this movie brought back many wonderful memories . navajo friends i , all rode mustangs so therefore our weekends spent riding through bueatiful high deserts northern arizona . this movie great movie , it all emotions person may feel 1880 . some what , i felt when we moved northern arizona 1960 . people wonderful grow up . this movie great movie , only problem i dvd see bonus features you special computer . i would happy spend extra money movie , if they could just put it dvd . i would very much like see extra parts left out , unless you computer read these extra parts . other wise i would given this movie 5 star rating	1
movie : one boldest most interesting films early 90 , one deserved far more acclaim attention than it ultimately recieved , this smartly written beautifully acted film should seen any cinemaphile open mind . despite whining some , usually hardline christian , corners , it not anti-christian all . what it simply great , imaginative clever film making , superbly character piece centered around magnificent performance mimi rogers , ably supported likes david duchovny , patton patrick bauchau . i'm not going go into it too deeply simply because it one those films should seen experienced little up front knowledge possible . ( please note i'm not attacking christians or christianity above , just small , but , usual , vocal closed minded minority always gets up arms any film dares tackle any such subject any degree honesty instead going down traditional biblical fawning path . people who instantly hate film like this just " principle " then proclaim all they should avoid " such trash " . you know exactly kind people i'm talking . they're minority , they just happen very vocal closed minded one . none anything their christianity much it their absolute closed mindedness their fear anything dares stray certain comfortable path . ) dvd : good news , this film finally dvd , pretty decent audio commetary boot . bad news , movie badly misframed , which something becomes obvious couple key scenes especially . i'm not sure whether this form censorship ( misframing one scene effectively nullify sequence any real nudity it once ) or whether it just botched transfer , but it clearly misframed regardless i saw this film twice it theatrical run framing different now than it then . plus misframing quite obvious anyway , audio commentary you even hear remarks film pertaining parts print no longer visible due said misframing ( so clearly they watching film it proper framing ) . unfortunately this doesn't appear available anywhere else dvd , so if you want film dvd right now this your only option , just aware going , hope better release somewhere down track . apart framing issue sound audio quality perfectly fine , only other notable extra film trailer . bottom line : really good , bold , interesting film disappointing variable quality dvd . mr	1

federico fellini 1972 film not his best , when he 8 1/2 , la strada la dolce vita his credit . while many critics adore this film its absurdity plotless , dreamy structure , i found it boring phantasmagorical . it simply fellini version rome not rome , eternal city itself . risk sounding negative , i shall admit there some moments which it most expressive early 1970 rome - scenes which hippies american tourists invade city , long scene outdoor restaurant where everyone talking their heads off ( though saying some pretty vulgar things ) my favorite scene- underground archaelogical excavation which frescoes old roman patricians fade into oblivion . but mostly this film weak it bored me because there no plot . it starts off alright , movie works well when there no sudden fantasy sequences . fellini himself this movie , well gore vidal . fellini envisions himself young man studying rome his youth strict catholic school ( slide/projector shows ancient monuments like colliseum , apian way , trevi fountain vatican well offensive pornographic image woman behind ) later young man journeys rome itself takes residence large family crowded apartment slum . then young man sees talent show tasteless , vulgar long-winded . i found myself just unimpressed outraged audicences went far throw dead cat stage ! it bothered me there much attention prostitution , brothels or cheap , slutty women . cover film promiscuous woman start film . film rome italy , there hardly any allusion opera or any true classical theater . pope fashion show ludicrous blasphemous . only serious , hardcore fans fellini want own this dvd . it perfect follow-up his equally absurd sexually radical satyricon , loosely based old roman epic .	1

good western starring clint eastwood released 1985 bringing more developed plot variation " high plains drifter " released several years before . film benefits good screenplay script which there more well developed characters keep audience interested . film set small mining town where independent miners terrorized boss who owns mine adjacent town . clint eastwood rides into town " preacher " sides beleaguered miners against local boss . film remains mysterious whether " preacher " really man or ghostly apparition past coming claim revenge past misdeeds . town boss eventually hires crooked marshall his posse take care preacher there seems past connecting them together . preacher almost leads one think he main character " hang ' em high " because noose mark his neck he hides scarf . this certainly one eastwood better westerns good plot extensive character development . film also certain element supernatural no one knows exactly whether eastwood character living man or avenging ghost coming out past . overall excellent film worth renting or owning	1

new yorker reviewer ( above ) might better suited hard news ; he obviously doesn't much understanding imaginative art . he should least remember cliche artists use lies reveal truth . he criticizes " eternal sunshine " " implausible " -- hmm , doesn't seem hurt reputation " tempest " or " midsummer night dream . " i think maybe reviewer should watch bloody thing eight more times , if that what it takes get it . i blown away ( admittedly bit confused , making me want watch it again ) first time i saw it . charlie kaufman borrowed little best sci-fi altering bit reality help him examine human condition . this isn't linear story , it meditation love , fate , regrets , choice , second chances - if you knew how it turns out , would you it again ? he may answered old question whether we choose who fall love . i may watch movie again really get under surface what happens lengthy sequence carey winslett character travel through his memories he tries hang her memory . i think carey winslett both give incredible performances , kirstin dunst . if nothing else , kaufman , gondry , cast remarkable job revealing how fragile we all - even guy who raiding clementine memories joel woo her himself comes across more sad then creepy . this , ultimately , very tender film . when i read dickens or shakespeare , i sometimes get sense author genuine affection characters he created , i get same feeling this film .	1

advent dvds , i've made it minor hobby compare various versions shakespeare plays - especially othello , lear hamlet . i not see polanski macbeth until recently but aware it decades . my view this single most powerful film adaptation any shakespeare play . though much too intense children or even most teens , polanski artful direction captures insanity , mysticism , jealousy , hate , horror playwright most brutal work perfectly . settings gloomy but realistic acting uniformly excellent . if polanski never made film , he would still remembered vividly capturing complex intensity this play . even jaded modern audiences emotionally exhausted film end- which not easy this age ubiquitous violence sex . this no holds barred shakespeare ; definitely not faint heart .	1
event this movie based so despicable john singleton ( director ) add fictional characters so it wouldn't look shameful rosewood really . some fictitious elements ... 1 . mann ( ving rhames ) character 200% fiction . not even loosely based any historical person . so ending , when mann shooting mob train ... never happened . 2 . emotional distraught racist duke ( bruce mcgill ) son , emmit , fictional not based anything historic . added dramatic purposes obviously . 3 . sylvester ( don cheatle ) died real life during shootout not return heroically horse beside train pick mann up . far i know , rest if pretty accurate .. reality , during massacres like rosewood , heroes like mann sylvester first die . but i knew when i saw him escape lynching , cutting himself down , shooting mob when he escaping train his character based " some " fiction . but then i found out his whole character fictional . singleton create hero , or else black folks would killing people when movie over . i wouldn't blame them . i remember i could hardly sleep night i saw movie . during events like this , not one person faced any charges . not one ! jon voight , always , gave hell performance . his character , john wright , obviously racist , but not bigot . but when he witnesses lynching folks he known years his face , he change heart arranges his friends who owns train passes rosewood pick up black women children . michael rooker , sheriff walker , great job law who could not control his town . he , too , racist , but still wanted order . black preacher movie typical religious uncle tom . proving karl marx theory religion role oppressive societies correct ( drug keep oppressed people satisfied belief after-life ) . read black wallstreet too . i'd like see director make movie . anton batey	1
nutshell : seems crazy , perhaps even insane , today but . . . half century ago , everything we now see " atomic cafe " not only seemed real , but it designed provide us ( effective this ) both motivation security weather nuclear age every way -- or least what we believed ! most all , propaganda provided fear which provided us motivation maintain vigilance we thought needed honorably provide security our way life . we wrong ? : atomic cafe means different things different people ! i live through shelter drills cuban missle crisis , but what it all meant relative propaganda shorts such " duck cover " we may never fully understand . we really need atomic weapons ? anyone ? atomic weapons something added , or detracted , our security ? what rest world ? yes , passage time reveal great deal nuclear age our policies . " atomic cafe " used sort historic tour-guide this recent era effect media us through excerpts official government films times . propaganda always seems so ridiculous superfluous when it put historic context , so what makes this type propaganda different significant ? maybe question can't answered yet , but see " atomic cafe " you may part answer . video : since this video essentially pieced together old propaganda films , quality transfer less than ideal start . add , " atomic cafe " made these already old film scaps 1982 , we see this going tired-looking video terms state its preservation . i not seen dvd yet , but i think i should probably buy one before this vhs copy wears out . bottom line : should fitting requiem nuclear agethis documentary needs seen appreciated it different though valid significant meanings different people	1

`the cider house rules ' succeeds delivering touching thought provoking melodrama that only elevated prime acting part it entire cast . homer , toby maguire gives one his better performances , although i still feel he comes across bit nervous uneasy , if he not too confident his own acting ability . this though offset brilliant acting part his co-stars , like michael caine charlize theron who embody their characters come across like seasoned veterans we know they . film follows homer , young orphan who raised maine orphanage dr. wilber larch ( caine ) who takes care orphans if they his own trained homer take his place . one thing homer could never get used illegal abortions , safe they , wilber insisted performing . it through one these abortions homer meets candy ( theron ) wally ( rudd ) . he decides leave orphanage them take work apple orchard . this course troubles larch homer closest thing he ever real family . this movie touches upon so many controversial subjects , abortion ( which controversial no matter who you talk ) well incest drug abuse , but it so taste tact intelligence makes this film much more impressionable . upon closing credits viewer given lot ponder , lot digest , but that tell tale sign movie this caliber , movie message , its job . i personally think `the cider house rules ' one those movies we all well experience ourselves	1
each these movies treasures . yes they old sometimes slow . yes , sound not excellent . we all seen them one time or . still , they filled some greatest movie quotes all time . when ronald coleman says famous line " tale two cities " , " it far , far , better rest i go than i ever known " , you can't imagine anyone saying it better . when laurence oliver , speaking his pursuit " lizzy " tells greer garson " pride prejudice " " .. chapeter definitely closed " , you seeing best mr. darcy miss bennet ever filmed . yes even better than kiera knightly . but total surprise , you get see w.c. fields " david copperfield " . who would known how great actor he . i still check out if this direct quote book or something fields made up when he says ... " copperfield , i nothing bestowe but advice , still , advice so important i never taken it myself ..... " enjoy these movies .	1

this film excellent , not too long not too short , light mood would make emily bronte proud . love casting sinead o'connor eb herself beginning end ! soundtrack only element gets bit much - same series notes over over doesn't really justice visuals . even though ralph fiennes juliette binoche visibly considerably older than teenaged- early-twenties heathcliffe catherine story , they very believable . other presentations wuthering heights polished , " sexy " heathcliffe who just isn't right since heathcliffe monster through through . fiennes carries it off beautifully barely sublimated savagery showing through every scene , yet remains sympathetic somehow . binoche mischievous smirk perfect cathy who more succubus than , instance , merle oberon glamorous princess 1939 version . i don't often buy movies own repeatedly view , so my shelf favorites not large , but this movie prominent among them .	1

my 2 1/2 year old son received this gift christmas - he loves bob builder we few other videos . this story , scoop becomes egomanical paranoid freak , which my son finds confusing upsetting . there few scenes where machines argue " camera " zooms close-ups angry machine faces . this he finds very upsetting yells me fast forward . it sends terrible message young children- someone treat their friends ( co-workers , whoever ) very badly , then end , when person messes up needs help , easily forgiven it all shrugged off . addition , foreign accents assigned some characters ridiculous almost offensive ( again , confusing my son ) yodeling virtual nightmare . it just so sad hit entertainment not produce storyline more empathetic characters , involve more learning . it total waste	-1

filmed early 70s just past easy rider woodstock epilogg 60s generation this film gloomy mood , kind after christmas depression one first 2nd half hippy era early 70s it looks dated but i think it intended way good way . barry newman car delivery driver after recent depressing life vietnam veteran , corrupt law enforcement possible suicide his girlfriend . film defines mental statis mind racing many vietnam veterans turbulant 60s early 70s who side him . he spent he knows it so he just dont give damm anymore hes out his last dash . 70 dodge chalenger he drives simblizes its last hurrahh well fast car factory winding down 1970 last year cars get faster . after year they started cutting back energy crisis follow . dodge speaks its mopar domination best speedy cars hemi supercharger pistal grip 4 speed shifter . although some may argue car star thats ok well . it looks good , sounds good , owns road , well little while . he driving denver san francisco meets some more depressed people way including cops , want [ ... ] robbers , desert burned out old man , hippi cult jesus freaks , hippi biker , blind disjocky , best guys naked blond riding bike who ask him sex but his chronic depression turns her down . he popping pills stay awake not appear any water desert his life unquenched very unsatisfied . best europian vergion when he picks up girl who desires wants him but its only temporary feel good , its only dream then back his nightmare his falling apart life . they block road 2 bulldozers but he could went around them . its like they gave him choice car him flash like his life 60s history . this movie defines period best like no other never like	1
this movie awful , completely inaccurate they made it seem like she just some crazy person who slept her way top . nowonder people think so badly marilyn monroe . i'm sorry but you not become pop culture icon stupid . that what they made it seem like . according this movie she only made three movies high all time , always horny illiterate . movie they even said " i get top even if i sleep every man hollywood " but really you think it though , they this every great artist . so i suppose that why they it here . they it michael jackson man mirror , mozart beethoven they make it seem like they no talent accendently became pop culture figures.so, sum it all up . you would dumb marilyn monroe portrayed like this movie ... belive it	-1

i agree some reviewers here , this dvd needs upgrade . it too great funny not time investment make this dvd worthy film . however , until new dvd comes , i settle what i . this film discussed length , i would just like add if you never seen this film , yourself favor buy it . not rent it . buy it . it good . tim burton made classic ghost story [ he made many great films ] but this film where i first became really interested his work . film stars young ( geena davis ) ( alec baldwin ) husband wife who recently died . they don't know they dead first , but come realize they never survived their accident . however , they new people home they once occupied : they don't like it . ( jeffrey jones ) funny this film , his character his wife ( catherine o'hara ) delightfully funny . dark broody daughter portrayed ( winona ryder ) who befreinds two recently departed ghost . however , main character ' beetlejuice , ' who portrayed very funny ( michael keaton ) . he helps rid ghosts pesky intruders : but cost . film funny well worth purchase . highly recommended . [ stars : 5+	1
ok , i saw this movie years ago when it first came out i rented it vhs dvd few times , still don't own it yet . this good friday 13th movie , but best thing this movie way they brought jason back file . you tommy jarvis now around 18-19 years old losing his hair , he escapes mental institution his side kick ( arnold horshack ? ) anyway , he goes cemetary rainy night dig up jason face his past once all . but after opening coffin seeing jason dead body he goes crazy ( obviously not taking his meds ) pulls metal pole cemetary fence starts stabbing jason while dead man still coffin . after calming down he throws jason mask down grave gives jason few choice words . all sudden lightening strikes pole while it stuck jason body . rest they say history . jason comes back life goes work . these movies so subjective , i loved it one best , last " real " friday 13th movie . but i would rent it see what you think before you buy it . i own parts 2-5 all good films , part ii probably best . i need part one , part six then my collection complete , nothing after part six important . part 8 funny watch , but not worth buying , but ending really good though	1

adventures superman began production its last two seasons ( aired during 1957-58 ) , series more or less overcome its tight budgetary restrictions evolving into veritable universe unto itself . it wacky universe indeed , operating under its own screwy story logic often totally disconnected any semblance reality . gangsters would watch their bullets bounce off superman chest then , emptied their cartridges , throw their empty guns superhero , if would stop him , or superman pals never seemed realize man kypton mild-mannered reporter clark kent one same , mattered not one iota its legion young viewers . fans comic books , big-budget movies tv shows recent decades , adventures superman rightly appears quaint times depressingly cheap , but if you stick it , chances you'll find it peculiar but very real charm all its own . this year hollywoodland , superman actor george reeves ' last years struggling actor private eye investigation following reeves ' death ( barely year after last show aired ) , adopts curiously contemptuous attitude toward show especially its fan base . though young children took its wild stories face value , many adults very charm show its good-natured goofiness . adventures superman one most iconically ' 50s/eisenhowerian programs its era . superman , after all , fighting not only truth justice , but also " american way . " instead super-villains like lex luthor , superman foes more likely communist types , ironically enough union activist robert shayne , actor who played superman ally inspector henderson metropolis police , during its run subpoenaed appear before house un-american activities committee nearly lost his role it not members cast crew who rushed shayne defense . wonderful example this very ' 50s tone " atomic captive , " cold war masterpiece . after russian fifth columnists fail bring back russian-immigrant nuclear scientist ( loyal naturalized american citizen ) , daily planet reporters jimmy olson ( jack larson ) lois lane ( noel neill ) drive out desert interview him . however , scientist dying radiation poisoning , so " hot " his mere touch likewise fatal . jimmy lois rush , naturally ignore his pleas not go near him , each pawing man reckless abandon . when scientist tells them they've just given themselves fatal dose radiation , all jimmy turn lois say , " golly miss lane , i guess we're . " making matters worse , they then drive out into desert , taking short cut through " ground zero " nuclear test site , wrongly figuring they wouldn't possibly reschedule h-bomb test they flown out cover first place . well , they wrong , take full force nuclear blast , just like glenn manning amazing colossal man . how superman save day ? you'll tune yourself . this complete lack common sense part lois jimmy used throughout these later seasons , apparently kind shorthand propel narrative forward without need lengthy ( logical ) character motivation . " perils superman , " imposing man lead mask ( michael fox ) shows up daily planet grimly announce he devised fiendishly imaginative means " liquidate " lois , jimmy , clark , planet editor perry white ( john hamilton ) . within minute or two after he leaves , lois perry blithely off meeting , business usual . it no surprise then they're kidnapped minute they get into lois ' car . then again , if nothing happened them , there'd no show . budget precluded superman actually performing feats grand " changing course mighty rivers , " but production values these later shows better than those when show began . seasoned b-movie directors like lew landers howard bretherton helmed episodes , star george reeves , while instantly recognizable character actors like jack kruschen , john banner , cyril delevanti , laurie mitchell , billy curtis ( martian mr. zero ) , dabbs greer , joi lansing populate episodes . serial fans likewise delight such familiar faces dale van sickel , tristram coffin , i . stanford jolley , usually playing villains . video audio adventures superman : complete fifth sixth seasons full color presented its original full frame format episodes varying quality . opening titles all shows tend look awful , but episodes themselves generally very sharp bright , super-saturated hues reminiscent early two-color technicolor . series used same shots superman leaping out windows flight over-and-over these modest effects probably never color-timed new footage , hence they tend stick out like sore thumbs . mono audio okay , optional subtitles french spanish . extra features only extra superman pal : jimmy olson , brief tribute jack larson charming performances throughout run series . he interviewed once again , noel neill superman historians jim beaver , gary grossman , michael . hayde , jan henderson . there no mention reeves ' untimely death anywhere discs , or anything various aborted attempts revive series some form years followed . parting thoughts though adventures superman scripts leave all logic door , stories these last 26 episodes pleasingly close spirit light-hearted tone era comic books . neill hair becomes almost phosphorescently orange both reeves larson fleshier features , reeves ' hair little grayer thinner , larson no longer 19-year-old youth he when show began , but youthful excitement still greets show remains unabated .	1

when blue lagoon came out theatres , i 17 , my parents refused allow me see it . it wasn't until i 29 , married cable i finally watched this contraversial film . while i still think it more appropriate actors 18 years old , rather than 14 , due mature themes nudity , this not your hot sweaty sex movie . you get buffy vampire slayer just any daytime/primetime tv , these days . what story 2 cousins , eventually left their own , trying survive eden-like paradise , innocence children natural curiosities adolescence brings . they love , gently affectionately , they child , they content . when ship nears , they make mutual decision remain island not try rescued . word , they complete . while acting overall pretty pathetic , script trite many places , there some poignant moments ; em " meeting " god laying flowers his feet so they would not make him mad would go heaven . richard contemplating bleached skeleton paddy realizing his own eventual fate , well em his son . mutual decisions not saved , well saying farewell each other after eating poison berries , when accidently drifting out sea . one cannot but heartbroken when they found asleep , rather than dead , because there no place society them . they belong paradise , director should let them die . even music becomes sad rather than jubilant . scenery gorgeous , beautiful score , acting fairly bad . so , why we keep returning blue lagoon ? because wouldn't we all like marooned gorgeous tropical island our perfect love left live simple fulfilling lives paradise ? 5 stars idea , 2-3 acting , so gave it 4 .	1

i seen chinese odyssey many times , because it just so funny ! chinese odyssey not really remake chinese classic , journey west , but it more parody , or side story based monkey king . chinese odyssey period drama set ancient china . here , monkey king , sun wu kong ( stephen chow ) reborn ( although he doesn't know this yet because he yet find particular person who " confirm his identity " ) , he now leader bandit group . two demons ( spider " white-bones " demon ) suddenly appear one day forcefully " force " bandits their bidding . there , story moves include time-travel , romance , friendship self-discovery . there plenty twists turns really different original story , which good since it doesn't get boring even if you already know story monkey king . however , minus you'll need know story monkey king able appreciate laugh some jokes aimed original story , but if you don't , there still plenty comical parts around keep you laughing . funny parts may rather silly times , but go ahead laugh their silliness . afterall , stephen chow known king comedy . :) end part 1 , you'd probably feel like ending too abrupt somewhat cliffhanger , but chinese odyssey comes two parts , so you'll need watch part 2 well able fully understand entire movie . if you into chinese mythology culture , give this try take time enjoy this show !	1

i not realize how old sound-track this made-for-television animation until carl reiner , interviewer , set scene , saying , " plane landed idlewild . " sound track probably taken record released 1961 . president jfk still alive ; his family no compelling need name things after him . so , airport still idlewild , not kennedy . according sources who asked remain nameless , since naming them would give away their real ages , mel brooks , 2000 year old man himself , carl reiner performed this little interview throughout 1950s , but never recorded it . i seem remember reading somewhere , perhaps new yorker magazine , first recording took place reiner home , sometime late 1950s . after dinner , reiner turned tape recorder , walked microphone over brooks - dear friend guest - set scene . then he asked first question ... i impression challenge new one brooks , but if my sources correct , they predict there would no weapons mass destruction , brooks reiner through routine many times before fateful night . now , i ask , tape transcribed onto record , or duo it again vinyl ? i don't know , but i suspect they recorded it few times . reason details . review appeared new york times 1975 , when animation this video first broadcast cbs television network , there quote : " i 25,000 children ... not one them ever writes ! " video quote " i 42,000 children ... even one them ever come over visit ? " so , perhaps time media home entertainment picked up animation marketed version i , 1984 , some things changed . who knows ? both versions joke funny , unless you sitting home , dark , waiting your kids call or come over , which case neither version funny . but seriously , " tragedy when i cut my finger . comedy when you don't look where you going , fall hole , die .

this classic western one sam peckinpah greatest . i found dialouge chemistry james coburns pat garrett kris kristoffersons billy kid mesmerizing . kristofferson very young this part fairly inexperienced actor but it doesn't show one bit . costumes period portrayed perfectly . characters dirty , crash , wild . there many colorful characters portrayed lot famous character actors you probably seen ton movies . slim pickens also here brief but memorable role . kid garretts friendship what holds movie together even though they don't show their early outlaw years together they don't . you feel two long relationship their friendship runs very deep . check this movie out if you want see great western just plain great piece movie making	1
i waiting movie like this years years , finally something made not complete hackwork containing nothing but nudity barely mentioning name hpl , even though posing " lovecraft-film " . i watched movie fellow lovecraftian , we greatly pleased adaptation . i never quite understood why teeming masses chose this particular tale hpl their object obsession , since there great number fantastic tales hpl vastly more memorable than call cthulhu , but i'll grant it indeed fine tale , even including journey norway it pages ! there not so much say movie , it ( once ) very true tale , so perfectionist i am , i didn't find much complain there . i loved opening scene wreck man telling tale understanding listener , his face unforgettable ! i only two small criticisms make , one fight-scene swamps , i found this quite silly , something nearly wrecked movie me my friend . other end , where great cthulhu reveals himself . i acknowledge they limited budget , but i just didn't quite enjoy him much i would liked . said , scene where man falls into wall while fleeing his divine attacker something i'll never forget . absolutely splendid ! whole island just perfectly , i adored it . bonus-material interesting , but i hope there few normal people out there who enjoy hpl too , not only bunch strange freaks , like many people behind movie undeniably . said , i really enjoyed film , apart minor criticisms i've already mentioned , i highly recommend this excellent adaptation set style 1920 movie	1
this film treated something like lost child canon director woody allen career . if he would apologize this instead , say , " curse jade scorpion " . what allen attempted here his directorial debut groundbreaking . this first example i recall director telling his film mock-documentary style , later employed albert brooks perfected christopher guest . allen proves himself not only great comic visualist but there great verbal puns here well . conceit film gas . we're supposed believe allen virgil starkwell , inept dweeb criminal , if not among fbi most wanted cause mr. hoover some sleepless nights . gags here rapidfire but i wouldn't spoil it those who uninitiated . my favorite , though , virgil orchestrating prison break gun he fashioned out soap during rainstorm . all this failed effort leaves him hand full soap lather . also , noteworthy cast late janet margolin virgil faithful wife . margolin basically plays straight woman allen but it shame this gifted actress who so good " david lisa " didn't more substantial film career	1
this movie story monty kessler ( brendan fraser ) , senior harvard who thinks his thesis his life . his computer fries ( surprise , surprise ) monty , perfectionist he decides go make copies it second his computer dies school copy center . only problem he slips falls while en route loses thesis boiler room one harvard libraries . he one his roommates then sneak into library ; only monty can't get his thesis back because old homless man decided use it firewood , only give it back him page page-a good deed per page , . initially monty decides use old man , whose name turns out simon wilder ( joe pesci ) not old he looks-to get his thesis back . but monty takes liking guy , all but one his roommates , two become very close . monty winds up learning lot simon ; result movie predictable many ways not predictable other ways . basic formula before , but this movie still good one , not awful but not best movie out there . it one those movies you watch over over again not tire . my book it gets four star rating . again , not best , there better movies out there , especially likes brendan fraser joe pesci , but worth your while . dvd this movie contains absolutely no extras i able find , not even music video main song " i'll remember " madonna .	1
i watched anger management plane . since there nothing else watch , flight more than ten hours , you usually watch whatever t.v. i thought this movie whole pretty bad , though there some funny parts . there some offensive language . overall , it bad movie not worth watching .	-1
i reluctant first write review eisenstein due very hot political nature he still regarded under ... said i feel his first three films absolute masterpieces cinematic art . his ability create tension through sequencing visual narrative make him uncanny choice greatest director all time . he making these films under very primitive conditions . however , eisenstein incredible sense knowing how strong visual medium not afraid go places his directing where no one gone since . sadly time somewhat unkind him . i also read his last years very unhappy he shadowed stalin regime . nevsky ivan terrible i am less defernetial ... they obviously not close eisenstein heart first three .. strike , october battleship #62 ;	1

remember when steven seagal hot property his action films decent ? well don't expect this wearisome retread . seagal plays jonathan cold ( thank god they didn't call him jonathan hott ! ) , agent some deep dark secret covert organization " four columns " ? tamara davies requisite hottie agent who wonders what seagal up carries like most female agents these romanian movies -- makes one dumb move after . storyline ( ho hum ) centers terrorists out set off nuclear bomb downtown los angeles . seagal hardly seen during any his few hand hand combats , pretty much confirming beefy actor stuntman all work , which there very little . preposterous chase scene garbage truck reminiscent roadrunner cartoons its lunacy . two stars hammy but effective performance john pyper ferguson villain . least he looks like he fun	1
otto preminger follow-up his ground-breaking film noir " laura " off-beat , dark foreboding tale con man eric stanton ( dana andrews ) who arrives small california coastal town literally no money his pockets . he soon under spell sultry waitress stella ( linda darnell ) . they no dough marry , however , so stanton plans get hitched wealthy heiress , june mills ( alice faye ) , then get rid her take her fortune . stella , however , not exactly sitting idly - she many boyfriends dates infuriate her lover . ultimately , things don't go planned ; stella found murdered eric prime suspect . surprisingly , june stands him tries him cleared . david raksin again provides haunting theme , dick haymes providing vocals stella favorite song , " slowly " plays repeatedly diner where she works . relationship andrews darnell very daringly portrayed 40s - what preminger able get away amazing - i'm surprised censors weren't all over him ! faye andrews actually end up sharing same bed motel room ( although their characters married this point ) but considering production code , it amazing scene not cut out censors . charles bickford provides right amount suspicion , cynicism ulterior motives local police detective who knows much more than he admit . darnell role stella turning point her career - she went portraying virginal heroines tarts femme fatales . her chemistry andrews explosive ; it could almost considered entanglement calls restraining order . faye blondness darnell dark brunette coloring give distinction heroine temptress . this film most remembered fact this last film alice faye would make over 20 years - she so angered because much her screen time reduced favor darnell ( although she placed blame studio , not linda ) , she left lot huff threw her keys guard . dvd transfer great ; it looks especially good since film out circulation so long . interesting extras , including photo galleries , theatrical trailer , commentary noir expert eddie muller dana andrew youngest daughter , susan , who gives some wonderful insights into this under-appreciated actor . not classic " laura " but definitely good example what dark film noir all	1
rebel without cause first movie james dean i've ever seen . i plan watch his other two because this one so good i didn't want it end . james dean one most beautiful actors i've ever seen . it wasn't just way he looked , ( though helps course ) but he also this charismatic way him makes you want watch his every move . i think that why , i watching movie , i started noticing he reminded me very much character ryan atwood oc . i first noticed way james dean looked people . he same manner ryan oc . james dean moves his eyes right or left sometimes instead straight ahead . his eyebrows raise slightly his smile never more than grin . it very endearing quality it why i noticed it so quickly into movie . then i noticed way james dean smoked . james dean made smoking cigarettes look like art form instead something could cause cancer . lol first episode oc , ryan took out cigarette he talking marissa he looked exactly like james dean . time though , i just thought ryan very " cool " " sexy " since i'd never seen rebel without cause . i no idea two looked so very much alike their mannerisms . there other similarities movie oc , such mansion trio run movie , model home oc where teens there go hide ryan . i'm not sure if this look character ryan atwood purpose make him seem like ' james dean ' type or if storyline just coincidence but my point saying all this i think kids today relate this movie . even though rebel without cause made over 50 years ago , teens today deal parental issues , peer pressure , rejection feelings first love . i would recommend this movie anyone ... especially teenagers .... who get tired same type movie they see over over . rebel without cause true classic i hope anyone hasn't seen it , gives it chance watches it just see themselves not all movies old , ' old fashion ' boring . this one great it one i could , watch many times . i'd really like add oc fans should watch it just see what i'm talking . i'd like see if anyone else noticed what i .	1

i know plenty people completely shocked i find billy madison adam sandler best movie date ( most argue me it happy gilmore but i could not disagree more ) . billy madison perfectly silly movie requires no thought need not overanalyzed . it adam sandler movie crying outloud , not ground-breaking documentary , so get over it . if you enjoy adam sandler somehow missed billy madison , you need go get it right now . billy madison ( adam sandler ) coasted through life his father dime . his father preparing retire wants leave his hotel empire his only son , but billy just wants drink sun all day live good life ( can't say i blame him ) . however , due billy lack responsibility drunken penguin-chasing ways , his father can't good conscious turn company over billy . plus , his dad admits he paid off all billy teachers first grade let him pass . his dad wants turn company over man named eric who worked him years , but eric evil guy . billy doesn't want eric gain control his father hotels so he throws log fire - he comes up idea return school take each grade over again order take over company . course , this where movie takes new silliness . i'm not saying this oscar-winner or anything like , but if you've bad day office or just need something mindless amusing zone out , billy madison movie you . adam sandler some great movies out there , but billy madison still remained my favorite one , even after all this time . absolutely recommended	1

you're not going able find dvd all these legendary performers going up one one same stage perform same audience . so if you enjoy " old-timey mountain music " , i.e. bluegrass , then just buy this dvd , prepare watch listen again again . i quite few music dvds , i think quality this one superior : 1 ) it recorded 5.1 dolby digital surround sound . 2 ) reviewer complained grainy video , but they just need get higher quality tv : i flat-screen sony wega tv , picture crisp sharp . 3 ) several reviewers complained placement backstage conversations , even pre-concert footage . suffice say since we weren't directors , then it not our decision . all concert dvds this extra footage ; it what people expect . i music/concert dvds where every song long rambling philosophical sermons band members . it like , hello ! put stuff end instead forcing it people . that not case this dvd . they cut away near end song cox family , but they're " keepin ' it real " , you expect some concert dvd . just glad they didn't slip some studio-shot music videos !

you pretty much know any film featuring both john candy dan aykroyd going generate some laughs , making great outdoors pretty safe bet anyone mood little comedy - comedy basically all you should expect here ( any film supplies subtitles raccoon conversations isn't really trying express anything meaningful ) , despite fact john hughes wrote script . once , hughes ' involvement more harm than good . while great outdoors certainly good movie , it not very good john hughes movie . course , it hard follow 80s classics like breakfast club pretty pink , but hughes ' heart just didn't seem this one . this best demonstrated teenaged romance part story , which stumbles start really goes nowhere all . when you come right down it , there just isn't any real depth any characters this film - that just not something you expect get john hughes . all chet ripley ( john candy ) wanted nice family vacation country , week relax his wife bond his two boys , especially older one ( frankly , i'm not really sure why younger son even movie ) . what he got " surprise " form his brother-in-law roman craig ( dan aykroyd ) his rather strange family ( annette bening playing mrs. craig ) turning up out blue vacation right him . you can't just tell family get out , though , even if family includes arrogant , rich , know-it-all like roman . chet his best grin bear it , but you know it just matter time before he loses it . when inevitable happen , it triggers series important events re-draw some main characters , even giving roman heretofore unsuspected ( albeit rather narrow ) depth . despite this , strangely insignificant summer romance buck ( chris young ) local girl ( lucy deakins ) , great outdoors really just plays laughs nothing else . some more memorable scenes include chet wild water ski ride , course , battle pitting chet roman against bat . you'll definitely laugh several different moments , but film never really elevates itself side-splitting plateau comic genius . many ways , this pretty safe comedy - it doesn't break any new ground , but it really comfortable fit . would okay many filmmaker , but great outdoors just doesn't live up john hughes ' usually higher standards	1

um ... maybe because our attraction visuals ! first off , ignore all reviewers who complain this story line isn't most imaginative ever thought up , therefore give this fantastic movie terrible review . main point this movie it visually fun watch ! movie starts zevo toy founder kenneth giving dying wish his military brother leland : brother take over toy factory when kenneth passes away . kenneth son leslie ( robin williams ) true love company , but lacks leadership skills really take over company ... until leland starts making toys into actual weapons use kids all killing . this forces leslie come grips some serious issues what really important him , makes him couragous leader ( captain patrick zevo , leland son ) toy army take leland insanity . i'm not big fan or rap any means , but i really got kick out ll cool j performance this movie , it fun watch his character develop into toy-factory loving guy . robin williams brilliant usual , rest cast enjoyable well . most important scene this movie definitly fake vomit testing room turns into potentially deadly crossword puzzle - but there many other visual treats well ... enjoy !	1
i first saw this movie child , age 8 , ever since i loved this movie , most important fact it darker , more interesting , adaptation oz story . dark side this movie may scare children , it myself , but it not overwhelming or too extreme . fact , this movie strikes fine perfect balance darker elements , so typical child , over age 6 or so , scared good way . this because darker sides this film represented things children really should watch out real life , such stranger adults , temptations wander far off home . characters unique original , set designs visual treat . this movie must see people who want more substance than overrated sappy ' wizard oz ' movie pathetically timid judy garland . this movie , fairuza balk plays much stronger compelling dorothy , who we respect believe . overall , this movie far better than any other oz movie terms its dedication original books .	1

if i must describe spirit st louis one word , extraordinary ! pilot real-life hero brilliantly portrayed great actor , who also pilot real-life hero his own right ! movies not just entertainment , movies magic ! sometimes i wish , i could go back good , old days when life simpler there wasn't so much useless information floating around : no countless " reviews " , no " making feature " , no trivia , no quotes . you enter theatre , you instantly transported world there nothing spoil experience you . i am writing this warn you- don't read any reviews before you see spirit st louis . i made this mistake i regret it . i really needed know how old james stewart when movie shot ? i wish everyone their late 40s looks terrific jimmy could easily pass 20 plus ! i don't understand why some people make such big deal something insignificant not affect film all . 1927 , charles lindbergh flew alone single engine airplane roosevelt field new york , across entire north atlantic ocean le bourget field paris -33 hours 30 minutes non-stop flight ! spirit st louis story this flight man who made it happen . james stewart performance lindbergh exceptional ! it keep you engaged deeply emotionally involved form start end . you feel lindbergh exhaustion during long lonely flight you admire his determination stamina . cinematography beautiful aerial photography breathtaking . i wish better music score , one would complement lindbergh sacred love sky , but that minor complaint . jimmy performance so powerful , you soon forget anything else keep fingers crossed lindy lend his little airplane one peace . he it dramatic triumphant end lives you totally fascinated inspired ! spirit st. louis special film . it glorious victory human mind , body spirit changed our lives forever same time it triumph james stewart . it not secret his request portray lindbergh turned down many times before he finally got green light . we only grateful his perseverance , it paid off beautifully . i no idea why this film not acclaimed 50 years ago but time works its favour people recognise its significance . it ranks #69 american film institute 100 most inspiring movies all time it one jimmy stewart greatest accomplishments ! dvd transfer nice anamorphic there few extras included dvd : theatrical trailer , " spirit st louis " premiere , short comedy " so , your life wants work " cartoon . i really enjoyed trailer documentary , but i felt let down studio including two , non-related film short stories instead interview james stewart perhaps . there not much credible information out there his extraordinary work his exemplary life i feel something . after all , james maitland stewart one greatest actors all time ( me , greatest ) one most honourable people who ever lived earth !	1
only annoying thing this great documentary famous baseball team events told more than once too often . you sometimes say yourself you saw some things first dvd when you watch second . apart , this it all , stars each decade singles greatest teams ; tragic deaths lou gehrig thurman munson mantle-maris historic 1961 season . baseball fans can't go wrong buying this 2 dvd set . i really enjoyed chapter yankee stadium best . when you think it , baseball without yankees would not mean same . they really choose best moments , although it would nice hidden camera catch all controversy surrounding reggie jackson when he playing there . i would suggest wrestling cage match reggie billy martin bonus feature . buy this , it worth your money , even if montreal canadiens all time best my list	1
first all - even though most my friends hate them - i must admit i enjoy watching some good horror flicks . my dvd collection also primarily concentrating this genre . besides classics , such " psycho " , " haunting ( original ) " , " rosemary baby " , " exorcist " , " omen ( original ) " , " shining " , " changeling " , " halloween " , " alien " " evil dead " . i also enjoy more recent flicks , such " 6th sense " , " others " , " ring ( us version ) " , " grudge ( us version ) " " descent " , " dawn dead ( remake ) " " tcm 2003 remake " . problem " beginning " , . viewer knows nobody survive this massacre second movie starts . which leads fact no hero found this movie ! . nobody gets know why leatherface turned out this way . damn , they could've atleast shown some flashbacks or decent intro e.g.in " house wax " . . there waaaay too much unnecessary gore therefore lack true suspense . these facts , especially last , make this movie over top gorefest same league " wolf creek " , " high tension " , " hostel " " saw ( sequels ) " . one re-viewer stated . horror movies should entertain giving viewer bonechilling suspense few good scares . this movie sadly couldn't succeed , due unnecessary gore , splatter blood . i don't need	1

truffault brilliantly brought screen cornell woolrich outstandingly paranoiac thriller , bride wore black . who but moreau could played role relentless avenger who finds so many inventive modes destroy those who killed her husband . church steps ! i like truffault ending better than novel contrived ironic one . novel , though fine , lacks melancholic weirdly comic quality film . it film puts one uncomfortable position rooting its murderous heroine though one her muders especially distressing both her us because victim endearing . but see yourself	1

what treat ! intrigueing disaster movie 70's! i highly recommend airport terminal pack , it filled memorable characters creatively crafted film writers , intertwined excellent plots keep you engrossed hours . excellently written acted - i give it 5 stars !	1
going i assumed this film suave player ( campbell scott ) who charm women end up passing this skill down his nephew . i only half right . during set up we actually find out he sort prick . if he likes you he uses his elocutionary skills flatter you . if he bad day he using them debase you . then his 16 yr . old nephew enters picture asks help ladies . normally he might not " waste " his time helping human , but i believe it creates nice distraction current turbulation his life . this film primarily takes place during one night . scott bss his way throughout evening trying teach his nephew thing or 2 . they interact couple chicks bar , elizabeth berkley who i enjoy jennifer beals who i find highly overrated . they like boy naivetivity . scott then continues night trying get boy laid while night gets seamier seamier . there definitely some truthfullness this movie , such when scott tells his nephew closing time scenario which everyone gets depressed just don't want alone . end it seems nephew may learned thing or 2 even though he'd probably retain his sweetness . scott may or may not change , but i think it more scene lonliness than any one or 2 characters . this film really seem push you into movie . i often felt uncomfortable , just like real life . this look filmmakers going it really worked me .	1

seen theatrical release " fanny alexander " several times through years , it taken me while set aside time watch miniseries whence it came . film , course , won four oscars including 1984 best foreign film -- widely regarded ingmar bergman most personal masterpiece . i've always appreciated film , but never really put it among my favorites -- but experienced it anew 5+ hour miniseries version , might just changed . i'm not going delve into plot particularly , but more my response viewing experience . opening takes place during grand family celebration . extended version , this full ninety minutes . within this time , we meet immediate family , extended family , servants , friends -- literally dozens people . you get sense relationships , real feeling dynamic within household -- true appreciation theatrical roots ekdahl clan . fanny alexander play minor roles all merriment -- no one given more screen time than anyone else . while this all very nice , you might not see real emotional impact this opening until end film . fact , light tone beginning doesn't prepare you what follow . subsequent episodes , fanny alexander lose their father . then year later , their mother remarries religious leader forsaking her past material belongings . it these strict , unforgiving settings real drama starts unfold . while i taken break after first episode , i continued watch rest " fanny alexander " one sitting . it absolutely enthralling drama . nuanced performances , battle wills plays out next three hours like great theater . it intense , thrilling , powerful , haunting , even times ethereal -- pitch perfect screenplay words chosen carefully maximum impact . much acclaim given cinematography direction " fanny alexander , " that all excellent -- but words perfection . there plenty terrific performances contribute impact film . i especially captivated ewa froling emilie , fanny alexander mother . jan malmsjo , showiest role new stepfather , alternately evil strangely sympathetic . scenes these two resonate me long time . so consider me convert -- i am now raving " fanny alexander . " while opening may seem bit long uneventful , i promise you'll see sweetness impact it brings ending . so watch longer version , stick it you'll greatly rewarded . kgharris , 11/06	1
i really enjoyed this show , although like other reviewers i seen here , i wished she little more older material . still , you understand she catch up her last three albums , since there no tour right after bedtime stories or ray light . most show material ray light music , which two really good albums . she opens " drowned world ( substitute love ) " , then dives right into " impressive instant " , one best 2000 music . there few songs i wouldn't included personally . i think she should replaced stuff like " candy perfume girl " , which i don't think terrible song , i just wasn't feeling it show . it kind fit into creepy skin head-punk theme she going though . also , " beautiful stranger " isn't bad song either , but it didn't much me live . we also could without " mer girl " live song . it nice pretty , but kind makes energy fun come screeching halt . images bruised bloodied madonna weren't very flattering either . still , i could understand way show worked ; almost if it all juxtoposition beauty ugliness . i liked it because it departure her usual live fare , but some costumes hair just hideous ! i hated kill bill/ninja outfit " sky fits heaven " , but i enjoy jumps kicks . i like " frozen " costume-that amazing should remained stage longer than it . i liked they included one remixes song well mix it up bit . i love " nobody perect " studio song , but not live . then , i bit over whole madonna-as geisha thing . " nothing really matters " might made better song somewhere however . western set included such songs " don't tell me " " gone " really good " human nature " much welcome return older material . loved mechanical bull ! it all very cute well . " funny song " not very necessary , though it meant novelty , stupid those who wanted maybe older song it place . also , i think dixie chicks already made song killing cooking no good man . " secret " one my favorites ! i absolutely love this song played live . last couple sets best my opinion . i loved " what it feels like girl " espanol ( could without remix accompanying disturbing anime screens ) . course , " la isla bonita " brilliant , usual closers " holiday " " music " right point . overall , it dvd worth buying . madonna genius putting all this together so many different themes ideas . while i disagree few apects it , mainly song choices , it wasn't my show . it madonna show i'll get over it . i like some other tours little better though . but it all good	1

first let me say if you like shows like office ( both uk usa ) or larry sanders show or curb your enthusiasm , you love this show . like those shows its shot documentary style makes it feel if you these characters lives . i first saw episode newsroom pbs . i immediately struck genius ken finkleman ( shows main star , writer director ) . where office shows you satirical view office life newsroom shows you equal satirical view toronto newsroom life . how " leads " news cast chosen ( i.e. higher body count ) mundane issues george news director gets hung up ( getting parking space buildings garage ) you find yourself laughing others misfortune . all genius this show i very disappointed three episode long finale . i guess it trying make statement narcissistic ways george but it just wasn't funny ( thus 4 instead 5 stars ) . said , last episode ( where characters transported political situation ) again genius . this dvd well worth your money	1
i'm sorry , i plead addiction , but i loved this series its first episode . i still remain true it . writing excellent , characters believable you really connect them . but best part mystery whole thing . all questions bubble surface your mind when you're watching show . it keeps you edge your seat , hungering more . it show really makes you think , i love . some people didn't like this particular season much first two because they didn't understand show still climbling toward climax . things aren't picture perfect , but they interesting . my only complaint it too short , here list episodes .... 1 . new world , part 12 . new world , part 23 . tom baldwin4 . gone , part 15 . gone , part 26 . graduation day7 . home front8 . blink9 . ballad kevin tess10 . starzl mutation11 . gospel according collier12 . terrible swift sword13 . fifty-fift	1

this one weirdest video adapatations novel i've ever seen . novel early work jane austen ( published posthumously ) so it not well crafted later works . despite novel weaknesses , however , even this video production not it justice . heroine looks like she heroin , maj . tinley ( played same guy who played older doctor " all creatures great small " ) positively creepy , his son , henry tilney , smirks instead smiles , thorpe sister just plain ugly ( i should say she just plain plain ) tilney sister stiff . i can't remember whether other videos this novel available this one i chose or whether there no other choice . only value video me it helped establish who characters their relationships -- before i read book . they say , " book better , " this case , old saying couldn't more true	-1
when someone tells you they not born yesterday it usually means they least iota intelligence . well , billie dawn ( judy holliday ) , blonde showpiece crooked harry brock ( broderick crawford ) , born yesterday -- amplified voice reminiscent jean hagan singin ' rain ! while harry washington grease palms corrupt politicians increase size his " junk " empire , he realizes his uncouth heartthrob hinderance his reputation -- forget his own personality not all winning . he hires journalist paul verrall ( william holden ) give his lady crash course " culture .

+++++ " intolerance jews fact 16th century life , even venice , most powerful liberal city state europe . law jews forced live old walled foundry or `geto ' area city . after sundown gate [ geto ] locked guarded christians . daytime any man leaving [ geto ] wear red hat mark him jew . jews forbidden own property . so they practiced usury , lending money [ ] interest . this against christian law . sophisticated venetians would turn blind eye it but religious fanatics , who hated jews , it matter ... " this how this wonderful movie begins above words printed on-screen so orient viewer . this movie based controversial troubling play " merchant venice " ( written circa 1596 ) william shakespeare ( 1564 1616 ) . main plot this play movie concentrates follows : sixteenth century venice , when christian merchant named antonio ( jeremy irons ) must default large loan jewish moneylender named shylock ( al pacino ) his friend bassanio ( joseph fiennes ) who romantic ambitions rich portia ( lynn collins ) belmont , vengeful shylock demands cruel substitute repayment antonio . movie proceeds we hear these famous words uttered shylock : " he [ antonio ] hath disgraced me ... laughed my losses , mocked my gains , scorned my nation , thwarted my bargains , cooled my friends , heated mine enemies , what his reasons ? i am jew . hath not jew eyes ? hath not jew hands , organs , dimensions , senses , affections , passions ?... if you prick us , we not bleed ? if you tickle us , we not laugh ? if you poison us , we not die ? " shylock continues : " if you wrong us , shall we not revenge ?... if jew wrong christian , what his humility ? revenge . if christian wrong jew , what should his sufferance christian example ? why , revenge ! " aware end movie , you may not know whether you've seen tragedy or comedy ( play officially classified comedy ) , love story or tale hate . its infinite ambiguity , movie play said quintessential shakespeare . also , aware movie entirely elizabethan language . if you not used this kind spoken language , i would strongly recommend you turn closed-captioning . ( dvd , unfortunately , not english subtitles . ) one final caution : there bare-breasted prostitutes appear briefly . they not put movie make it more risqu� but rather add some historical authenticity . venetian law time required all prostitutes bare their breasts because christian authorities concerned rampant homosexuality city . thus , this movie `r ' rating because this ( which i think ludicrous ) . acting this movie word -- fantastic . i surprised this but al pacino thoroughly convincing shylock , very complex role . i also give credit jeremy irons ralph fiennes who fine jobs their roles antonio bassanio respectively . cinematography excellent . movie filmed location venice , veneto ( region north italy ) , luxembourg . background music exquisite . i heard lute , harp , other instruments i'm not familiar . i learned later some music contributed baroque string quartet . ( baroque period art period circa 1600 1750 . ) background vocals mesmerizing . finally , dvd ( one released 2005 ) perfect picture sound quality . it few extras . bottom line : this movie worthy addition bard cinematic cannon . ( 2004 ; 2 hr , 10 min ; wide screen ; 28 scenes ; rated `r ' ) +++++	1

other reviewers said , leonard maltin absolutely wrong this film . comedy very tight well timed . dialogue wittiest any movie i've seen era . it tend little toward one-liners , but it doesn't matter because it fall-out-of-your-seat funny . ingrid bergman divine role you would never expected her . signs times ubiquitous -- references quot ; pill , quot ; quot ; hippies , quot ; quot ; squares , quot ; etc ., but comedy far dated . best aspect film its unconventional plot . romantic comedies highly predictable class -- this one keeps you guessing . puts even neil simon shame . highest recommendation	1
oh my , this movie god-awful . it feel throughout group first time actors playing medieval dress-up dragons camera . special effects consist computer-generated dragons extreme overuse people backs getting set fire ... that pretty much it . plot also very weak so typical . fighting scenes horribly choreographed acting so bad it looks like first time efforts every actor except two kings theldag . picture ben stiller slight beard , medieval clothes , wig . that hero this calamity movie . there also typical trite very poor attempt humor spattered throughout also . this definitely low budget title . it also 4:3 full screen only . i consider this movie purchase one worst i ever made , but it cheap . you get what you pay	-1
first season six feet under featured astonishing acting/writing/directing , truly amazing new show . however , show began lag part way into second season . it lost its witty death related humor , began lose format original shows . decline second season culminated clich� cliff hanger , typical shows don't know how maintain interest . season three starts confusing premier which includes massive jump time ejects viewer out show , further illustrates writers ' budding ability not deal tough issues . season four show fully declined into rather lame incongruent night time soap , standard love triangles , mystery deaths , psychics . they also managed fully lose their format , beginning death dictating tone show . one episodes starts death based anti-lsd agenda , after first scene they completely ignore issues kid who died . i'm pretty sure fisher sons diaz didn't even embalm guy . some point massive amount useless sex they added show , extended kidnapping episodes become nothing more than unpredictable uninteresting . if you enjoy first season six feet under , quit while you ahead . however , if you enjoy shows like alias , lost , days our lives , their cliff hangers , disjointed action , love octagons , then i would advise you party !, enjoy last few seasons . bottom line : if you looking good tv , kind where pain , humor , love dance similar fashion life , watch first season don't waist time rest . if you just love characters no matter how strange they written , continue all means ; plot doesn't get worse , just writing acting directing . porn factor : season four people just random sex , story lines seem little better then bottom barrel porn . so , i guess , good soft core porn win	1
one could review kingdom heaven lot levels ... action packed medieval adventure/romance ... vehicle some your favorite actors ... or statement humanity less than perfect attempts find spiritual meaning life way doesn't lead warfare people differing points view . i expecting mostly first two ... pleasantly surprised find reasonable amount third . my favorite quote movie summed up powerful feeling i've spirituality some time now : " god understand , my lord . if he doesn't , then he not god we need not worry . " why people so infrequently ask themselves whether god they believe really makes sense their hearts or not , i don't know . when i heard these words coming screen , i realized " someone out there understands ... we don't find god books or doctrine or sermons ... we know god our hearts , or not all " . this character looked his heart knew ... god understand ... anyone who doesn't surely not god , no matter what someone else might claim . if you loved movie , you'll enjoy this dvd ... it classy widescreen handling film that visually rich deserves seen it cinematic format . gorgeous scenery delightful characters costuming , i can't imagine watching such visually appealing film less than wide screen form .	1
great seller - this one my favorite dvd - too , too cool !	1
dvd series 500 nations excellent educational series , it shows very good background history plight native peoples americas . time cahokia , mayans , aztecs , incas . it gives look into way natives treated spanish portugese invaders true story columbus which united states educational system doesn't teach american students , instead holiday set aside columbus backed us government . series gives outstanding look into true relations maltreatment united states government , towards native peoples first settlers modern government our country , this shameful reality those us caucasion ethniticity . series excellent loaded beautiful scenery vital information into us history , but it cuts off way quickly turn 20th century . when reality story continues unfold even today i believe there should continuation series show story modern native americans , both there hardships their good fortune some cases	1

i remember watching these shows young boy telly during summers ' 89 ' 90 when i off school staying barnbury park nearby islington . all shows i vividly recall loving this 1st season red dwarf . more so than later seasons . it minimalist cast , low budget simple plot idea 1st season shows not only got me into sci-fi futher but shaped my overall sense humor sarcasm . nothing i've seen america comes close red dwarf . positives : one most original starts any show i think . all episodes season 1 , whiles not funny later seasons tightly produced every aspect plot well thought out dialogues very clever brillantly acted out . if anything , red dwarf during early seasons remined me alot black adder episodes shot mainly one or two rooms whole time consisted mainly very clever funny " stage-like " dialogue 2 characters trying deal each other their problematic environment . no negatives me but : these not average commercial , mainstream fast food tv shows easily eaten quickly forgotten . there lot intellegent charm , wit well constructed science fiction plot situtions here entertain everyone . this season rewatchable ( more so than later seasons ) not catch dust any collection . it needs re-watched really appreciated . however some aspects jokes not understood everyone who not familiar british culture or know what curry vindaloo ... then again my 12 year old cousin , who never england or remembers much 1990 , doesn't know what vindaloo or even familiar time travel science loves show .	1

phenomenon could one those syrupy , maudlin-filled stories we've handed , but thanks intelligent script , astute direction jon turteltaub stunning cast , this movie poignant , touching affirmative nod human spirit . john travolta one his best performances plays george , auto mechanic who one night " sees bright light " , stunned it wakes up changed . he now obsessed knowledge , learning , he little telekinetic boot . how this affects him people his small town overrides obligatory governmental intervention subplot . travolta marvelous so rest cast : kyra sedgwick relation-phobic young mother who object travolta affections ; robert duvall superb doctor/friend who tries get travolta through this change ; forest whitaker his farmer buddy . fact , whole cast right target support this remarkable leading performance . phenomenon touching , offers look how travolta friends find themselves both awe fear his newfound powers	1

oleanna twisted , vicious young woman need bring man ( extention , all men ) down . john , played william macy , college professor . carol , played debra eisenstadt , one his students . when carol seeks help failing grade , john goes out his way help her personally , one one basis . carol more than little irritating john becomes more than little irritated her seeming inability grasp simplist concepts . playing good professor , john faults his pedantic self her failure understand material . days later , john caught off guard when carol maliciously levels charge sexual harrasment against him - just time destroy his bid tenure . her earlier need help set up . carol keeping notes all - cataloging any word or action she might turn against him . carol campaign against john facilitated what she refers " group .

while oliver stone 60's-style " hipness " intrudes too much into characters situations , overall film good honest portrayal nazi-like terror inflicted this country police military beasts human form . associated amnesty international this time i'm well aware real people who tortured , mutilated , raped , murdered , " disappeared " name " western values .

though based famous character phil silver famous oldie tv show , new " sergeant bilko " less homage show than it classic steve martin his 1970 days . though this bilko ( again shifty tireless grafter , evil face non-coms everywhere ) very much opportunist silvers ' character ( he runs base casino ) , shy risk silvers ( unit mobilization orders desert storm mysteriously disappeared ) manages get caught his own dealings silvers ( bilko botches fixing army boxing match , unwittingly tricking each boxer think he one who supposed take fall ) screwball zaniness very much out steve martin snl days . script bilko unit charged testing brand new army weapon - " hovertank " soon cancelled because , among other things , it simply doesn't work . hovertank end spell doom his own cozy position doesn't seem bother bilko , mostly because he lives day-to-day . things change when officer charged evaluating hovertank turns out fearsome major thorn ( phil hartman ) . years earlier , bilko unwittingly made enemy thorn accidentally implicating him one his bitched schemes . now major , thorne isn't simply content enough eliminate hovertank , but must now axe bilko well . they say desperate times reveal man , bilko now revealed spineless weasel his troops come love . martin plays bilko like character one his old snl skits . it sort fun watch guy work material we haven't seen since his more sedate days playing less zany funnymen ( " la story " , " roxanne " ) more mature dramatic roles ( " spanish prisoner " , " grand canyon " update " silas marner " ) . it light breezy you'll probably forget most gags , script under-uses most supporting cast ( especially now late-great phil hartman bilko evil nemesis ) , but it still fun	1
i admit first time i saw this video i laughed out loud . why ? four grown men t-shirts kilts playing rock roll . wow . well , now when i laugh it shear joy ... their fantastic seasoned , fun , high energy performance . bruce plays his heart out ; tony , cool ever , ads his own magic bass ; mark drums -- clear crisp -- really showcases his talent . stuart .... he blast . you see his love affair audience , he gives above beyond energy , extra guitar solos , , well , like i said , you could tell he fun ( not much fun perhaps he berlin peace concert -- man , there he shining , too , but younger " look this crowd ! " bright eyed commanding demeanor ) . back final fling -- here you see mature stuart company comfortable their scottish colors .... tennis shoes ? tony black ankle boots , which hoot itself . i've said lot visual this dvd but i add audio outstanding ... mesmerizing . this fantastic dvd .	1

veteran english teacher i've taught this play all my career i never tire it . although some acting over-the-top times ( consider parents ' reaction helen condition first 10 minutes film ) , this classic nearly flawless . anne bancroft patty duke won well-deserved oscars their dynamic performances andrew prine made career out playing roles like his " jimmie " this film . script intelligently adapted play author william gibson even cleared up vague scene play implied annie might quit kellers . direction sturdy unobtrusive arthur penn who went very distinguished career . this wonderfully insightful inspiring film holds your attention beginning end . it little sentimental times , but that very forgivable . note : patty duke plays helen this film , but 1970 remake television she plays helen teacher annie sullivan . talk clever casting	1

sudden death i got this movie because i powers boothe fan , came like film itself . it gotten lot poor reviews , but i disagree i think film lot value mainly because chemistry actors . my favorite parts film those interaction emily joshua foss ( powers boothe character , never mentioned name except ending credits . ) duel wits these two priceless this best character ( emily ) powers boothe ever plays against my opinion . i believe it bears much more resemblance two `under seige ' films than `die hard ' its critics claim . children make this film so unique , they big part why characters where they , when they ; why plot unfolds way it . there violence , probably young children shouldn't watch it , but older mature teens might like it because emily tyler . this film deals , least surface level , many issues such government ineptitude , job-related disability , divorce/marriage/child custody , more . powers boothe , dorian harewood , colm meaney terrific villains . powers boothe especially plays great sociopath , low baseline mood , superficial charm emotional distance --- although more insight than most . whittni wright plays emily mccord , nothing listed imdb her after this film --- pity really i would love see more her . ross malinger plays tyler mccord he terrific , i'm happy see he moved good things since . film scored john debney , it his worse piece work ; subdued especially action film , unoriginal , not outstanding any way although believe me i've sat through far worse . there official soundtrack release but good luck finding decent-priced copy . debney went wonderful job `passion christ ' , whodathunkit he got well-deserved oscar nomination it . my gripes : this tenth anniversary we please widescreen release i think we've waited long enough , collector edition powers boothe commentary would nice but i won't hold my breath ... not lot extras dvd , but few good behind-the-scenes items ... idea noone needed go inside or outside stadium during game , or noone would cellphone or there would media blackout something like this really stretches credulity . it worth $10.00 price just good piece cinema history . i would like see prequel or sequel , say , emily joshua foss meeting up someday but now i guess thanks `deadwood ' powers boothe too famous sequel ( foss seemed quite dead film end , but this hollywood after all ) . finally : recently audio book `sudden death ' released audiotape narrated powers boothe , it terrific worth price if you find it . if you disliked movie you might like this audiobook , if you liked movie you'll love this audiobook	1
housewife named brandi typical torchlight releases . almost non-existent story horrible , pointless dialog ties together several very long sex scenes . story ? brandi buys computer . she sets up website sell lingerie , where she models lingerie front webcam . people make fun her site , so she starts sex her female friend husband front webcam instead . guy two other girls see site decide same thing steal all her business . end , two camps decide merge . that it far story goes . there six sex scenes . three boy/girl , two girl/girl , one boy/girl/girl . expected torchlight , scenes long , nine thirteen minutes . this good bad . most time it good , because all women video attractive good job during their scenes . few bad moments occur when director gets stuck some shot isn't particularly hot or interesting instead cutting away something else , it just drags one or two minutes . but overall , i thought sex scenes good . there four women video . ander page , april hannah , nicole luv , remy . ander page only one i recognized . she three scenes . audio video quality excellent . there no extras dvd all . i liked this dvd don't regret buying it . but torchlight stuff not something i unconditionally recommend . you not going get story or any dialog even remotely interesting , sex scenes going run three four times longer than what you'd see something like playboy softcore flick . but me , primary reason watch softcore sex scenes , this one delivers area quite nicely	1

3 story-arcs classic dr. who , this really good price set , especially one including logopolis castrovalva ( both which i've tempted vhs just see them again ) . these part iconic tom baker run 4th doctor end his final season role . k9 gone , romana . he wears his plum digs suit somber mood his last 2 stories : keeper traken , logopolis , castrovalva . disc one : set opens keeper traken which reintroduces master ( absent since showdown doctor deadly assassin ) . end his 13th incarnation ( 12th regeneration ) he stays shadows ( so speak ) much 1st half this one , but end he literally new man . this one introduces nyssa , eventually become new zo� , brainy-girl board tardis , while adric , equally brainy but not really sensible also board all 3 these ( when they learn super-genius kid annoying archetype ) . plot this one shaky but necessary reoccurring role master 5th doctors run . disc two : next logopolis . if keeper traken somber , then logopolis literally wake before funeral . doctor more visable distressed over leaving romana e-space ( still waiting dvd e-space 3 set ) . his plans fix long broken tardis chameleon circuit logopolis . before doing so , he must find real police call-box measure , but doing so inadvertently lands around " new master " tardis , which ultimately leads death doctor ( well mortal wounding anyway ) . loads moody shots , out tardis , lots quirky labyrinthine scenes future companion tegan lost onboard . new master terrifically , theatrically hammy plays nicely off baker manic energy ( although substantially drained his standards , character doctor seems stoically accepted his impending death baker stoically accepts his retirement . ) he leaves top his game here , great , great story . disc three : castrovalva introduces 5th , youngest doctor ( time i'm not sure tennant age ) . peter davidson , brings character away 4th doctor style borrows heavily older doctors ( spite his youth , he plays it more like stogy old original incarnation played william hartnell . ) when filming , shooting order altered so , although this first new doctor episodes , it shot after four doomsday ( story 2 season ) . so davidson knew where his regeneration addled transformation would end up , because he already filmed wholly recuperated doctor . but process hard one , castrovalva opens immediately after doctor regeneration , his companions try get him safety , narrowly escaping master , or so it seems . while doctor struggles retain/ regain his wits ( see brilliant scenes doctor struggling not lose his way unraveling 4th doctor iconic scarf ) . crew falls deeper into master web traps arrive castrovalva , appropriately named after m.c. escher work . great start new doctor . new beginnings : drinking games drink whenever you hear " cloister bell " ( ringing which means emanate danger or drunkenness)drink when master watches / rebukes doctor gloomy safety his tardis console room . drink whenever one actor or character replaces via regeneration / body snatching / disguise or miscasting . drink whenever someone misplaces doctor ( including himself ) . drink whenever anyone declares : " but , doctor there ! " drink when any tardis crew complains . this one pays off !	1
not really scary . just loud noises shots speeding cars , spinning fan , sunsets . oh , there must some big shocker end , right ? not really . there some notable cinematography some decent music , but other than , this wasn't even worth rental me	1
this movie pinnacle blaxploitation films . lead character black man who wrongfully imprisoned then cruelly experimented jail . when he gets out , he unique pinnochio-esque talent . but , it not his nose grows ... think lower longer ( ha , ha ) . i could not stop laughing he killed his enemies his " secret weapon " . this movie not meant taken serious , but it accomplishes something other blaxploitation films this time not ... truly unique storyline	1
best part movie farrell . almost morewoody than woody . tragic story moderately interesting , butvain heartless overall . woody again shows he near zero giftfor drama serious dialog . however , classic question tragedyvs . comedy contrasting stories worthy ( barely ) material . farrell bunch classic allen deadpan one-liners , storyplays out moral tale sorts ( goodies end more happiness end ) . i modestly pleased ( but if you don't likefarrell , even his charmingly innocent roles , this not you )	1

first all , i'd like point out incident mentioned review lupis1 takes place second season jeeves wooster , not third . however , i agree this season some very good episodes ( though not good second season ) . major fault i jeeves wooster dvds , like many dvds same genre , there little none way special features . " interactive menu " not count special feature . i would like see some audio commentaries some bbc dvds -- see what hugh laurie , stephen fry ferdinand fairax say process turning wodehouse memorable characters book screen . characters incredible , plot-lines hysterical . best episode " hot off press " .	1
this series deserved more seasons than it , though final season wrapped things up quite nicely . i still think resolution end rather un-fair though . those who haven't seen end episode , i am not going give it away . but introduction new mainstream characters , only lifespan one season ... can't good . but over all review , i very much enjoyed third final season .	1
andy milonakis makes me sick my stomach i hate his show it stupidest *** ever . show so horrible after watching some it leaves me even more dislike this weird *** adult acting trying entertain teenagers . andy show sucks instead wasting time this **** better off buying copy tom green show . i wish i could give it no stars my grandma not get me this ***	-1

i hadn't seen this while until recently , it still me my toes . this came out when i high school , but i didn't see it until after i graduated ... but i remember hype it " racy " . i really didn't know what think it first ... but after seeing it few times , it grew me . maybe it sex ... or crime drama thriller ... killers getting away killing ... or combination above . i remember hearing reading stone mixed-review performance beforehand , but after seeing it myself , i personally thought it fit character . you never really trust her , although times you almost want . i hadn't even really seen douglas any movies before this . if you liked this , than fatal attraction must see well ( i didn't see fa until after this one ) . throw here beautiful score jerry goldsmith ( which classical musician i noticed ) , well what become one my favorite dance tracks since i heard it high school , la tour " blue " dance club scene roxy . far flaws , i agree reviewer realism her antics she getting questioned . what wrong these guys , what really makes her so special ? they really haven't seen anything like her , polygraph guy says ? that main thing bothered me , but it movie , long you know , don't take it too seriously . there lots funny moments , esp . curran friend gus ... " that magna cum laude ***** fried up your brain ! " i didn't know this same director starship troopers showgirls , but this far better 3 . i think this one those movies where you either like it or you don't . again , movies aren't always supposed realistic , so just appreciate it what it . some movies keep you watching it more than once , others don't ... you don't always valid reason why . me , this just one those movies :)	1

many reviews here already indicate , this film not everyone taste . set dublin , it reflects something sensibility modern irish drama , its harsh , black-comic edges its ambivalence sentimentality . ensemble piece loosely weaves together more plot threads than viewer hope follow or account after seeing whole film , it capable cast skillfully portraying broad range characters , not any them particularly sympathetic , though you find yourself cheering some their small victories . yes , colin farrell fun watch charming but sociopathic skinhead . but all their brief fragmented moments screen , there standouts rest cast well , including colm meaney , whose character seems wish he tough cop " miami vice , " wistful kelly macdonald young woman who just wants steady man , even if he married , cillian murphy her totally hapless boyfriend job he hates stocking shelves supermarke t.t he movie farcical riff many different forms anger . almost everyone grievances lead them everything rage depression , which many viewers begin wear thin after while . there exhilarating relief while we witness spectacular bus crash , later film cuts back forth two simultaneous car chases , each them ending badly . finally resolving all this high-powered negative energy bit more than this film manage , ending rather unsuccessfully brings us soft landing . but then endings not easy anyway , what you remember film its oddball moments , which capture better than anything desperate measures people take while looking love all wrong places	1

after i enjoyed martin scorcese " departed " , i decided watch film inspired celebrated director re-make it move action hong kong boston , ma , usa . i must say i liked original movie better : 50 minutes shorter than scorcese magnificent remake , " infernal affairs " tighter , faster , more compelling tells same story better . it not grand acting jack nicholson who basically plays daryl van horne attitude " infernal affairs "' characters don't talk don't curse much they " departed " but hong kong movie only benefits it . much i admire leonardo dicaprio bill castigan , tony leung ( yan ) his role simply unforgettable	1

there so many possibilities . this spy thriller . it works several levels , quite bit comedy keep it light . i interpreted much character development satire british people themselves . hitchcock careful . those last days before war british censors tough . if british didn't see humor it , i'm sure americans . you two chuckle-headed school chums prattling endlessly criket . cheating barrister his vapid paramour both married back england parnoid found out . then there miss froy , ( dame may whitty ) old , sterotypical spinister governess . even heroine , iris , played margret lockwood , blond ( naturally ) beautiful airhead , her facile , soon boyfriend , gilbert ( michael redgrave ) . miss froy goes missing train without getting off . she just made aquaintance iris then , poof , disappears . iris help gilbert seeks find her annoyance most everyone aboard train . but miss froy isn't what she appears . she secret agent british germans want kidnap her . only they weren't germans . order not offend nazis time , germany simply refered middle european country . they phony , german sounding accents like evil psychiatrist who identified czech . brits pulled themselves together when crisis hits . train stopped attacked police . miss froy amazingly nimble old lady . she jumps out train window evades 24 young men shooting her . hilarious . she gets back england before everyone else . see this . if your not hitchcock fan you maybe after seeing this , one his last movies before he moved hollywood .	1

this documentary , released concurrently hard-cover book same name 1991 , brief but highly accurate overview life art billie holiday . book , text robert o'meally , contains literally hundreds rare photographs , good deal these liberally sprinkled throughout film . but ultimately , it sparsely produced but flawlessly executed narrative her life craft make this dvd stand out among few biographical pieces released great lady day . film contains interviews several billie closest friends musicians who worked her . insight provided fellow jazz-singers friends carmen mcrae annie ross indeed enlightening , but it observances her fellow musicians , mal waldron , buck clayton harry " sweets " edison , well particularly eloquent comments writer jazz historian albert murray , make this documentary particularly illuminating . there snatches billie greatest recordings , which consist excerpts illustrate exactly what so unique lady genius , often accompanied explanations what made her music so important , or perfectly timed clips jazz audiences dancers day , reveling music . one point , trumpet player harry edison remarks billie jazz musician , way she used her voice , " attacked words could swing just like trumpet player " . his comment immediately followed brief clip her 1936 recording " i can't give you anything but love " ( teddy wilson his band ) which she exactly emulates sound instrument her voice . albert murray sweets edison carefully explain , once all , billie not blues singer , but jazz singer - very best jazz singer , while buck clayton , carmen mcrae mal waldron clarify billie first vocalist use her voice dramatically , change melody phrasing songs fit her mood , improvise written music create form art original it unique . they make you understand billie holiday literally influenced every singer came after her ; this film makes it possible someone little prior knowledge her , or her craft , understand exactly why she such important influential figure both popular music jazz singing . simply put , billie holiday changed way singers sang songs , this film articulates this fact vivid clarity . film goes out its way ( book ) correct some more glaring inaccuracies her biography , not flinch somewhat sordid sensational details her tragically short pain-filled life . same time , portrait one someone who certainly enjoy their life fullest despite tragedy , billie revealed basically happy cheerful ( if often abused ) person she really . throughout we hear actress ruby dee read some more accurate portions billie " autobiography " - lady sings blues , book she didn't write , probably never even read . also worthy note contributions producer milt gabler , who relates story behind billie biggest hit , " lover man " , which he produced decca records 1944 . there also well-orchestrated effective buildup song " strange fruit " , social political aspects which carefully explained milt gabler ( who labels it , " first important protest song " ) . he relates columbia records refused record it , fear " bad press boycotts " their southern dealers . annie ross says , " i knew it banned , i knew why it banned " , while carmen mcrae simply states , " just straight up facts , you know , way it those days " while they all express their admiration billie her brave stance african american , who dared sing song lynching pre-civil rights era 1939 . discussion followed late clip billie , looking absolutely radiant , singing song before television audience , while accompanied mal waldron piano . expressions drama etched her face while she runs through powerful lyrics , ( " southern trees bear strange fruit , blood leaves , blood root ; black bodies swinging southern breeze , strange fruit hanging poplar trees " ) right through dramatic climax , ( " ... sun rot , tree drop , here strange bitter crop " ) make this video potent testament her amazing valor artistic perfection . there other rare wonderful ( if much too brief ) video clips billie holiday her best , sometimes , stark shocking end her life . one clip begins particularly sickly , ghostly looking billie , her appearance nothing less than alarming , but clip progresses we realize poor video quality , combined unflattering camera angle bad lighting , make her look far worse than she really . moment later camera switches angles , relief we see she far more elegant healthy-looking than she appears onset clip . we also get brief scenes her only film , new orleans , louis armstrong , made 1947 . while billie sings song " blues brewin '" , close-ups give us rare glimpse into what it must like experience real billie holiday ; she sings words , " ... suppose you want somebody , but you ain't got nobody , you only got gleam your eye ... " , her expressions absolutely brilliant . there not only gleam her eye , there wrinkle her brow , lilt her gestures contractions her facial muscles , all combined , communicate range feeling show expression lesser singers could never hope convey . priceless . climax film celebrated clip her singing her composition , " fine mellow " famous 1956 television special , voice jazz . accompanied several her peers jazz world , including ben webster , lester young , roy eldridge gerry mulligan , cameraman wisely chose concentrate billie face , even soloists took their individual turns , we get delightful look billie playfully nodding her head time beat , appreciation talents her fellow musicians clearly showing her eyes motions . some viewers expressed disappointment fact more video clips billie not presented here , forgetting ( unfortunately ) there very few video records remaining her performances . i believe i now seen , through this other available videos , most her surviving video performances , this film contain some very best them . but inclusion those few precious video clips notwithstanding , it explanation billie art clear articulation her genius make this documentary so gratifying . film closes story her life , albert murray comments , end , it , " eloquence , universality her statement matters " most , while carmen mcrae reflects , although much billie voice gone time she recorded " lady satin " , there something her voice , even then , could evoke intense feeling , miss mcrae says she still plays album , cries . over credits , we hear few bars " i'm fool want you " lady satin , we instantly know exactly why carmen mcrae found it so moving . highly recommended .	1

if one film could some up ouevre jean luc godard it would probably ' band outsiders ' .. it great example french new wave .. many godard pictures plot not important - its like he saying - yeah , yeah , we've seen this plot million times before lets just use it means improvisation .. raoul cotard cinematography we see paris all its glory - filming streets like no one else .. yet despite all this playfulness ' band outsiders ' plays one godard most wistful , melancholic films .. maybe it score legrand ( who capable much better ) - but everytime i see this movie combination music image never fails make me get extremely tired actually doze off - i like this movie ! yet this what makes me hesitate calling it godard best ( though it contains some his best moments ) .. so i would say this must godard fans .. my personal favorites godard ' breathless ' ' pierrot le fou ' - although it hard beat minute silence ..	1

im big halloween movies fan .... while i thought this one would good unique , it anything but . first all , its very dissapointing see continuation h2o simply michael myers not actually dying , rather fleeing away through some bushes dressed paramedic . then jamie lee curtis eliminated without follow up beginning movie paves way what one worst horror films ive seen lately . concept some people michael house not terribly bad , but fact they made it so today standards " horror films " just discredited whole movie . so many characters pointless roles , this whole rapper celebrity trying fist fight michael myers , its just too many elements don't help . i don't recommend it all . if you halloween fan , you highly dissapointed this one	1

i sat through this entire film even after my wife begged me turn it off then stormed out room watch tv living room . she bored tears felt premise unbelievably stupid . little she know , i completely agreed i just this thing only seeing part movie . i finish it , even if i knew i gonna hate it . me idea anthony hopkins could black man so unbelievable i couldn't even begin concentrate meat film . i understand novel acclaimed everything , everyone , even critics feel this film loyal novel , but if that case then novel can't great . if they chosen actor i could believed it maybe , i mean , i light skinned black friends i know they could pass white , but when they tell you their black you see features ... anthony hopkins whiter than i am ... there no way i could pass black so hopkins out . really if it weren't excellent acting parts hopkins , kidman harris this movie would no redeeming qualities . so here you it , young black man looks white , realizes it easier just play white then who you , he disowns his family live his life easy , he becomes teacher now his 70 he accused racist people who think he white so he starts affair much younger woman whos drunk husband wants kill them both , he , then his secret exposed this guy who wants write book him . i just such hard time getting over idea some idiot thought anthony hopkins could black i can't even see this movie good it . i'm sorry ; this review probably so tainted it not even funny . all i know this great movie , i mean even premise something i would normally really enjoy it just so hard get over ... i'm rambling ... never mind . like i said , i really tried	1

when ellen evans directed this movie she managed get sex scenes energy , passion , sensuality , creativity . fans softcore know how rare these things . just how skilled director accomplish them . which make directors cut this movie ( which sold here ) such mystery . my only guess when she given chance reedit this film she wanted make version she could watch her 14 year old daughter , or maybe she trying get job hallmark channel . what ever reason if you fan oxygen network buy directors cut , if you fan softcore get original version .	-1

this one single most beautiful films i ever seen . unfortunately , i found story line just bearable . there lot fantasy involved perhaps it metaphor something i haven't grasped yet . regardless , it just didn't pan out me end i found myself wishing it better written . said , i need reiterate : this one single most beautiful films i ever seen . there one particularly bad cg sequence , but beyond , it visual masterpiece , hence five star rating despite lackluster storyline . i highly recommend it if only sheer unequaled beauty cinematography .	1

i rented this movie mostly because they goof it " 40 year old virgin . " i like caruso csi miami , but i begun see caruso always plays david caruso . yet , here he plays even less cheerful cop . what fun . his character jade so stoic he makes dirty harry look like neurotic . sadly , this one those erotic thrillers neither thrilling nor erotic . it better than your usual shannon tweed erotic thriller twaddle , mostly because you get chaz palminteri supporting character rather than , say , william katt . plot makes no sense , however , sex scenes boring . if you want good-looking sex , rent some porn . if you want good thriller , rent rear window .	1

never even heard this 2002 when this released , 2002 great year itself sci-fi . we star wars ep2 , solaris my favourite sci-fi film up point ... minority report . then only couple weeks ago , went down my local hmv store saw this shelves sale . my expectations wasnt very high , but i am big fan . bale me , he always engaging . after putting this , 107 minutes later , i hooked . not way i utterly impressed like minority report when i first watched it , but somehow , it certainly me thinking movie theme , gunkata fight sequences , which so awesomely jaw-dropping it outdid anything matrix ever fraction its budge t.t hen i watched it again commentary , i caught all details i missed out first time . then it hit me , this great film . no , make it supreme film . 2nd time around , i noticed cinemtography production design , which word , beautiful . story , which whilst not original , definitely very engaging . 1984 , fahrenheit 451 movies come mind , but they never this entertanining . make this 1984 this millennium , movie moves ultra slick pace matrix , but more deep rooted theme dystopia control worlds apart philosophies twists walchowski bros . way , it simple story , but simple stories told well acted well also profound long lasting . acting , i believe bale role his best . it not easy notice first he plays cold , ruthless cleric despatches resistance hardly blink . but his physical abilities fluid movements shows off bale capabilities action hero give keanu neo run his money . but what augments this immeasurably his ability act ... slowly emote over length film . catch scene where he awakes sunrise first time , able feel appreciate it even this simple act . emily watson short but very effective role woman who first instigate him think turning . their scenes not easiest , yet tension eventual connection they make through just looks slightest dialogue . sean bean always equally memorable his very brief role bale partner . round it up good performances taye diggs angus mcfadden this movie surpasses usual sci-fi stilted acting we so often bombarded . kurt wimmer , director also smart director . instead giving us cliches , he gives us situations which you might not necessarily expect , short but stunning fight sequences instead prolonged fights explosions/stunts which only hampers story pace . ultimately , it movie rewards subsequent viewings , may explain why this turned into such cult classic among its devoted followers , myself included . fan fiction fan videos already extended world libria pay homage movie its characters . while it may never reach dizzying heights matrix , it doesnt need . this film not masses , but those who really appreciate its intentions its strong visuals ( despite its lack budget ) eventually , theme behind it . kurt himself says , its more numbness towards everything how one man reacts it finds himself liberated simplest things we take granted . myself , i enjoy rewatching this only best sci-fi movies compel me so . it simply not just sci-fi cult classic , it geniune masterpiece genre rarely produces one	1
this film not only severely biased , but it fails explain why israel would deliberately attack their only ally . time friendly fire attack there huge explosion near el-arish where israel fighting egyptian troops . because israel attacked sea day earlier , they presumed egyptian warship firing them . us never even informed israel ship 22 miles off coast , it not even supposed there first place , joint chiefs staff repeatedly cabled liberty previous night instructions withdraw distance one hundred miles egyptian israeli coasts . short this film only matches venemous lies anti-semitic , anti-israel websites which preach hatred	-1

lolita , based controversial novel vladimir nabokov , who wrote screenplay stanley kubrick , but kubrick disregarded it ( i read this wikipedia ) . read novel assignment college , i thought this movie going obscene novel ( without downplaying book , i mean only lustful utterances character humbert humbert ) . kubrick cleverly builds up sexual tension humbert humbert lolita , while charlotte haze blinded her mature age her need finding man herself , not pay attention evident lust humbert humbert her daughter , flirtings her precocious child . there big lesson this movie one humbert humbert fails pay attention : ' universe not revolve around you . ' when he realizes it , lolita already fled away after held secret affair quilty ( peter sellers ) , who turns out stalking , deceiving man , person much more dangerous than humbert humbert himself , one we thought sexual predator , but who , end story revealed just pathetic sick man . what could very nasty movie , surely cut , or even prohibited censors ( sexual situations just insinuated ) , instead drama seasoned comical overtones , like when motel , humbert humbert valet trying deploy collapsible bed , while lolita sleeps . sidenote , i wish stanley kubrick peter sellers could worked together more projects , peter sellers great both lolita dr. strangelove ; surely peters sellers best actors history cinematography . while novel , vladimir nabokov kills all ' sinners ' his story ( lolita dies during childbirth ) , here kubrick lolita , she survives . not scared away classification this movie art movie or cult classic , stanley kubrick didn't shoot his movies elite intellectuals , but all us who enjoy good story	1

while watching this film , i found myself irritated whining bickering goes , wondering how it could better . hanging up tells tale three sisters : meg ryan eve , bulwark family , runs her own business ; diane keaton georgia her own self titled magazine ; lisa kudrow matty , somewhat vapid soap opera actress . their elderly father ( walter matthau his last movie role ) memory problems , can't walk admitted hospital . he going die . ryan daughter who saddled responsibility her father , while other two too self-centered even care . all this could made compelling " dramedy " but director keaton allows over emoting all conflict override gentler side losing parent . matthau not all likeable either . cloris leachman brief appearance his ex-wife adam arkin ryan globetrotting husband . it surprising most honest moment film comes brief sequence ryan mother doctor whose car she crashed into hospital parking garage . ryan tries gamely hold movie together although she quite good , she can't really salvage film . keaton kudrow both adequate , but no depth observed . matthau more like matthau than true character it sad his last role so unlikeable . hanging up tries tackle sensitive real issues but it so contrived it fails	1
if you take this movie what it , enjoy it humourous manner which it intended , you'll laugh whole way through it .... favorite lines include : " some funyuns man "" if he aint back hour , i'm calling dominos "" fish , fish ... i aint no fish "" no window love you " great movie .... not good young kids , but your older teens laugh til they cry .... remember it just movie ... dont try this home	1

frank julia forbidden love affair focus hellraiser , but cenobites stole show . this time around cenobites given lot more screen time . dr. channard , man dark obsessions , devotes his life researching infernal netherworld . kirsty becomes his latest patient his psychiatric hospital , after hearing events took place first movie , channard decides reanimate evil julia . he agrees bring her victims so she continue regenerating , exchange she his guide labyrinth hell . christopher young music awesome . loud , dramatic , ominous - movie theme during opening credits lets viewers know what they're getting into . his music also very significant during scene when tiffany solves puzzle box . music conveys tiffany childlike innocence her sense wonder she handles studies box . tone speed music ( tiffany manipulates box ) raises tension fever pitch . then , after deafening silence , movie theme erupts gateway hell unlocked , cenobites once again freed walk earth . their spectacular entrance this scene even more impressive than first movie when they appeared after kirsty solved box . this scene also when pinhead delivers most important line hellraiser ii : " it not hands call us - it desire . " but you need hear doug bradley delivery line it any affect you . line may look laughable , but it powerful so significant because it speaks volumes nature cenobites . it seems cenobites not slaughter someone who solves box unless person desire see what happens when box solved - even if person doesn't know what happen when box solved . would explain why they wanted torture kirsty first movie . since tiffany wanted solve box simply sake solving puzzle , she spared . she no idea anything would happen when she solved box . raises questions nature game - since cenobites obviously knew it channard who called them , why didn't they go after him ? or they think it kirsty who called them ? channard no qualms all when he people killed , yet he timid man . it clear he expects julia protect him whatever unknown terrors lurking hell . channard ultimately finds what he looking - pays painful price . there cenobite battle hellraiser ii , which disappointing because it so one-sided . there reason this though , case you don't get it when you watch movie , it explained audio commentary . dvd audio commentary ashley laurence , director tony randel writer peter atkins . their commentary very descriptive informative . they gently poke fun their mistakes , this makes commentary more enjoyable . lord knows there some glaring mistakes . but anyone besides me notice hostility seems exist randel atkins ? thought them sharing mutual dislike each other grudgingly doing this commentary together gives me perverse pleasure . i loved this movie up until kirsty reunion frank . point this movie goes hell ( manner speaking ) . it would nice if script dropped dumb subplot kirsty looking her father - even if left no reason kirsty character this movie . it near end movie when pinhead delivers his infamous line " your suffering legendary - even hell . " but even pinhead wit can't uplift last half hour this movie . but it pretty funny see patients tearing hospital apart - just how they get their hands all those puzzle boxes ? different actress plays female cenobite hellraiser ii - she less menacing this movie , but still entertaining . i glad see she still bloodlust so evident first movie . but i would preferred it if she didn't sound so nonchalant when she talking , i missed wide-eyed stare actress first movie . chatterer different face one point hellraiser ii , which confused me until i heard audio commentary . personally , i preferred chatterer original face . it real surprise when chatterer identity revealed . without giving away too much , it involves shocking scene - murder child . ending hellraiser ii made no sense whatsoever , but i'm guessing filmmakers wanted wait until sequel explain what going hell . yes , this writing i only seen first two movies hellraiser series . hellraiser ii also reveals pinhead background . needless say i disappointed - i preferred think cenobites lovecraftian origins . i even dreamed up whole history mythology cenobites after seeing first movie ! but i loved look dread despair pinhead face ( right before undergoing his `surgery ' ) toward end movie - you know if someone like him fearing his own safety then he must serious danger . how mighty fallen . buy soundtrack this dvd so you properly savour first two-thirds this movie	1

french way steamy films makes rest cinematic world seem bland comparison . nathalie fine case point . based idea philippe blasband transformed into superb screenplay jacques fieschi , fran�ois-olivier rousseau director anne fontaine , this incredibly well acted , subtle , understated film explores many facets adultery - woman point view . result suspenseful , erotic , intelligent film provides opportunity three france greatest actors demonstrate their credentials . catherine ( still very beautiful gifted fanny ardant ) gynecologist married successful bernard ( g�rard depardieu one his more subtle roles ) they stay-at-home hippy son ( rodolphe pauly ) who goes his life much same his parents : there superficial companionship but little depth relationship . marriage seems satisfactory until catherine suspects bernard affairs , fact bernard very honestly confesses : his eyes affairs sexual dalliances mean nothing . catherine shocked , attempts gain some support her insular but worldly mother ( fine judith magre ) who tells catherine it normal situation older marriages . catherine visits bar , private club consignations , there she meets marl�ne ( extraordinary emmanuelle b�art ) eventually buys marl�ne services prostitute meet her husband then tell her all encounters . it agreed marl�ne known ' nathalie ' . this point catherine nathalie meet after nathalie encounters bernard describes acts encounters vivid lurid detail . catherine fascinated continues pay nathalie going encounters subsequent voyeuristic descriptions . catherine even one-night stand her own bartender fran�ois ( wladimir yordanoff ) attempt understand her husband need infidelity . despite setup ' private investigator prostitute detective ' two women become friends . when catherine realizes she enough evidence against bernard leave him there final encounter three ( catherine , bernard , nathalie ) brings ingenious surprise ending - ending fine share it would spoil film viewers new story . ardant simply radiant catherine , playing role victim wife adulterous husband supreme dignity . likewise depardieu makes his bernard so understated profoundly honest conclusion retrospect should suspected . b�art once wholly physical her prostitute role yet maintains inner core confused woman keeps us her side she her job . production values all first rate ( except some ragged editing ) direction anne fontaine bristling intrigue wholly convincing her development this strange tale . despite dialogue x-rated there very little actual sex this film : makes it not only more powerful but ending revealed adds solidity story . french english subtitles . highly recommended art film lovers . grady harp , december 06	1
`lord flies ' made into movie least twice since william golding novel same name became cult classic / must read volume high school college students late 1950s . first version , which follows novel very closely , black white noted director , peter brook 1963 . second version color harry hook released 1990 . like many remakes same language , one immediately wonders why bother , original brook version more than gripping enough convey message novel . highlight differences two versions , let me outline story shared two versions . scene set when airplane carrying school children crashes south pacific , coast remote tropical island . approximately 30 children , ages 6 13 make it shore gather beach work out how they survive assume since they far removed their original destination island small uninhabited , there good chance it take long time , if ever , grown-ups find rescue them . first two principle characters ralph , one two or three oldest boys who we meet first , company intelligent , bespectacled , slightly overweight boy same age known `piggy ' . third main character jack , old fit ralph . three minor named characters simon , who prone fainting `seeing things ' sam eric , pair twins . early vote sets up ralph leader , few rules establishing conch shell found ralph piggy first reel symbol right speak gathering boys . jack immediately assumes responsibility leader `gang ' ( later become `tribe ' ) hunters who also take responsibility maintaining signal fire which ralph succeeds lighting using piggy eyeglass lens means concentrating sunlight clump tinder . jack gang gets involved too much hunting allows signal fire go out just aircraft flies near island . soon , story evolves presence monster island . this creates pretext jack split off group his tribe create camp more defensible location . this larger group becomes more more primitive , they raid ralph camp steal piggy specs since it only means they starting fires . placate monster , head killed wild pig cut its carcass stood top pole near suspected monster lair offering monster . after few days , simon observes this pig head its very large collection flies feasting festering flesh imagines he hears pigs head speak him , hence , source title . simon then killed when hunters mistake him night monster . when ralph piggy walk jack camp recover piggy specs , piggy killed `accident ' when jack tribe members pry large boulder loose falls piggy . ralph jack fight , ralph driven off , whole tribe sets fire jungle flush out ralph , presumably , kill him . both stories end ralph runs beach find himself feet very professionally uniformed member his country elite armed services . hook spices up dialogue making boys much more hip lots swear words references contemporary popular shows such alf miss piggy muppets . unfortunately , hook looses two most important elements whole story . beginning novel , subtly , beginning brook film , we see world once more war boys several different schools plane australia find relative safety coming ( nuclear ? ) conflict . hook shows nothing this , giving us simply group boys same military academy trip goodness knows where . this totally looses whole allegorical sense story where conflict boys mirrors war world large , especially sense last scene where world ( island ) destroyed conflict ( fire ) . second major oversight hook rendition there never enough attention given significance pig head , simon vision , sense `the lord flies ' . less important point origin monster myth different two movies . brook film follows book it misinterpretation billowing parachute fallen , dead pilot . hook creates myth out spasms downed plane delirious pilot he finds refuge cave rediscovered simon who believes he monster . both movies credible job depicting fall nominally civilized boys into savagery myth . combat ralph jack near end straight out frazier `the golden bough ' myth killing king . unfortunately , hook version seems eviscerated pig carcass , all great allegorical original story totally lost . , minimal they , i even think boys ' performances brook version better , their initial innocence face this loss civilization makes their transformation all more interesting . brook version highly recommended .	1

although some films here overlap some other early film dvds out there ( such edison set ' lumi�re brothers ' first films ' ) , there also some films here can't found anywhere else , it provides very nice introduction subject someone who just getting into these very early short films dawn motion pictures . categories include edison films , films lumi�re brothers , keystone short ( featuring charming mabel normand leading role ) , biograph short , max linder short , short french films , short documentary-style films , two very early film classics ' le voyage dans la lune ' ' great train robbery ' ( latter beautifully select hand-coloring ) . basically , it gives viewer good sampling various different types films made 1890s early teens . these very early films like literally looking back time , this bygone world , world where moving image so new revolutionary people didn't care movies only lasted under minute showed things like employees leaving factory or two babies quarreling , since they'd never seen these miraculously moving pictures before . it also opens short 1994 film ' homage eadweard muybridge , ' who invented zoopraxiscope , which projected series pictures way suggested movement . he one pioneers invention motion picture , even though here we're seeing series photography ( 1877-85 ) , not actual motion pictures . ( those who offended such things should aware woman these series photography " films " naked , times partially other times fully , though there absolutely nothing sexual or pornographic here ; it just series images woman who so happens not any clothes . ) my one complaint this disc ( other than mislabelling ' i.b. dam whole dam family ' ' whole dam family dam dog ' ) most films don't any dates given . even if one already familiar films this era instead new fan , it still nice them placed into historic context see years they all made . some bonus features also would nice , provided , say , some background films , people who made them , restoration process , what film-making like these very early days . it always nice supplemental information enjoy appreciate these antique films even more	1

first time i saw this movie - several years ago - i not very impressed . but now , today , it appeals me much more . i appreciate it upon 2nd or 3rd or 4th viewing . it definitely worth one collection . leslie caron fine little actress , her leading man very believeable filthy-rich , bored-with-life snob . until he tangles sweet , funny , gay , enchanting gigi . she softens him , falls love him , when she blossoms giddy schoolgirl into charming , alluring adult ( teen-ager ? ) , help her grandmother sophisticated aunt , his eyes opened , he definitely hooked , all ends well . " but it , you'll like it ! " i would given it 5-star rating but fact i thought there bit too much maurice chevalier i t.p.s. - it offer english subtitles . maybe french too , i don't remember .

" midnight marquee " series great idea , offering two old aip films one dvd , this one definitely worth , but primarily first film , " abominable dr. phibes .

" dr. phibes rises again " adequate follow-up , but falls several notches below original . it almost though everyone going through motions because inevitability sequel , but their hearts aren't it . everyone except co-star robert quarry , who takes things quite seriously . result , he very effective dorian gray-ish type part , but he also comes off though he not really joke . nowhere near stylish , or even logical , " dr. phibes rises again " still its moments -- bumbling policemen lot fun -- but it remains something disappointment	1

all i say , wow ! blame it my watched dallesandro movies " reverse " - viewed blood dracula flesh frankenstein , i prepared stone-faced portrayal dallesandro ... perpetual sneer worn over rigid , blank expression dallesandro " trademark " both films . instead i blown away fresh faced boy , beautiful smile , expressive face dancing eyes . wow ! this film must any dallesandro fan . quality film grainy , sound equally grainy little jumpy- but once you get used these deficiencies , you quickly get caught up story . i use term " story " loosely since , what i understand , entire thing shot without script - allowing actors simply ad-lib . it may , story line unfolds fascinating manner . once again , i disappointed find no commentary or interview dallesandro included special features . instead you get commentary morrrissey that only slightly interesting . i highly question his assertion he making some grand statement this movie . i think now , he wants looks back history pull grand statement , what then , only meant entertainment . but then i've always found morrissey little egotistical . ( besides which , i think morrissey should kicked turning dallesandro into stone-faced actor who wasn't allowed smile . ) people should know while this no means pornography , graphic male nudity makes this unsuitable young viewers .	1

this film took me back time age 15 when only thing mattered how many friends you , how popular you , your status social pecking order . high school society most meaningless , inane , irrational , unproductive place world one . it almost better dead than go school every day , point agnes evidently concurred ( uh , no , she doesn't die ) ... this messed-up decadent reality modern world , where youth idle , nothing their time except obsess over shallow , hurtful social war-games . our society not engage young people helping solve today problems ; so , many problems ( like lost our manufacturing u.s.a. , or our export jobs careers , demise american middle class , environment ) simply not get fixed , people grow up callous uninterested solving social problems . this film indicts entire system education , which needs overturned revised ... i call two main characters " real " girls , contrast other girls this film , who not real , but phony , obsessed playing game getting into other people business . i not idealize lesbians particular , but extent they real willing buck social system themselves , they highly admirable . these two girls different personalities each other , it would really interesting see how their relationship progressed over time . but this movie first love ( lesbian ) , only involves initial stage , somewhere rejection acceptance . i won't tell you how movie ends , but it very moving highly recommended . i really feel agnes	1

ok , i'm only writing this because i wound up popping this dvd into my player last night watching it again . i bought this movie years ago after first seeing it laughing like imbecile pretty much throughout . yes , it sick humor . no , it not everyone . but this tom green ! i can't imagine what some people who reviewed this movie expecting - citizen kane ? c'mon people ! there precious little plot - just enough each tom green site gag or gross out gag , which basically what tom green known . letting him direct this film , i can't imagine what people thought they'd see ? most people i know not like this film , close friend mine still make fun me liking it , if i ever bring up title , but so what ? if lowbrow humor , sight gags gross out scenes make you chuckle , this film you . also , great acting , usual , rip torn - he hysterical . just remind yourself it tom green vehicle , you're only watching it lowbrow humor , you'll fine . if you sit down watch major movie production , yes , you'll disappointed but i don't think even close aim this movie . still ridiculously funny after all these years . baby scene , " backwards man " scene , sausage scene absolutely inane , yet priceless	1

i went see " touch zen " late seventies new york film festival . all seriousness it my greatest moviegoing experience all my years moviegoer . i guess it because whenever i saw classic film like " citizen kane " or " bicycle thief " or " godfather " or whatever , i prepared see something great . but i totally unprepared this . i never seen anything like it before . when hsu feng suddenly revealed her ability fight this awe-inspired power grace -- not mention bound like gazelle -- it hit me all beauty magic what movies . it knocked me out see woman warrior like this . since then course i've seen many films like this . " crouching tiger " quotes many films , but ang lee james schamus fans this one . but there also " matrix " ( shot where hsu feng revealed ceiling over door ) course , " house flying daggers " - scene bamboo forest totally ripped off film . course , countless hong kong films . this bible . i also believe painstaking beauty it leone-like compositions , it influenced new generation filmmakers like zhang yimou . other directors king hu time made four films year . he spent three years this . but thing remember " touch zen " completely before cgi . course there lot old-fashioned cinema trickery , but much it just plain old acrobatics . so i little afraid see what i would think it decades later . what made first time work how unexpected it . anyway , i popped copy , just check out how bad copy . i ended up watching whole three hours , finishing two am . i've seen so many other films like this since , but it still bes t.t he copy just like ones you see restoration videos , when they show you how brilliant color faded there all these scratches , etc . there version this film comes different company , it available amazon . uk , but you would need all-region player , which course illegal . it might end up same print anyway . there version i've seen cinflix.com no subtitles . one final note , i actually met king hu hollywood backlot eighties . he trying make hollywood film producers midge sanford sarah pillsbury ( " desperately seeking susan " ) i guess he little too early . i'm sure there would place him now , but he passed years ago	1

i just bought this dvd today i thought it good . not great . donald pleasence always good each films . without jamie or donald , they would no movie . this 4th movie tell jamie , daughter laurie , who , this movie , ' dead ' . michael alive escaped once again . now after jamie , he returns haddonfield . dr. loomis also survived fire , now cane , he little slower than he 10 years ago . dvd presentation film best you find anywhere . extras also really good . i no idea dwight little , director , so skinny . i thought him fat , horror geek director . if you liked first 2 halloweens , than this you . ps : skip halloween iii all together	1
don't let this movie running time ( 325 minutes ; almost 4 hours ) , fact it not english , or it cricket , put off any potential viewers . this not action film , nor it high-suspense thriller . it doesn't any special effects , no blood , no gore . yet some reason , story catches you up you find yourself caring what happens . personally , i found four hours whizzed . i don't know more than couple words hindi , so i can't say how accurate subtitles , but they certainly good enough me informed . i especially appreciated subtitles musical numbers , which you rarely find . american , i find cricket rather mysterious . so i didn't understand finer details cricket match , but i definately got wrapped up tension suspense , even if i didn't know why . which , if you think it , good reccomendation ! acting great ; aamir khan very charismatic , intense , down right handsome . i appreciated gracy singh acting well ; she could really camped up her jealousy scenes , but instead came off adorable ; how could bhuvan ( kahn ) not love her ? i wonder how long it took british actors learn their hindi lines , or if they doing them phonetically . i digress . if you even passing interest india , indian history , bollywood style movies , or even peculiar game called cricket , then you enjoy this film immensely	1

there aren't many cases where movie better than book , but " goodbye mr. chips " one them . james hilton tossed together his barely over 100 pages big type week . scriptwriters film fleshed out good story line much more detail . well-directed just superbly acted robert donat title role , this film endearing classic . basic story traditional english schoolmaster , set period mid-victorian pre-wwii . it gentle tale meaning man life how we rise excellence our modest professions touch lives many . mr. chipping ( " chips " his students affectionately know him ) leads rich life , although also fraught sorrows . there still much relevance film -- tragedy war , importance balanced education , evils caste . yes , film sentimental little manipulative , but you probably not mind . fact , you may cry your eyes out . compared r.f. delderfield " serve them all my days , " book " chips " not nearly good , but this film tops bbc mini-series " days " virtually every way -- especially managing leave out lot class warfare ! order it , go buy box puffs , plonk yourself down delightful classic	1
this documentary written , directed edited ray greene features clips independent movies made 1950s 1960s height ( relatively speaking ) exploitation movies united states . clips , " schlock ! secret history american movies " interviews people who made these movies . you should recognize least some what whizzes here ( e.g. , " nude moon , " " carnival soul "" ) if you any familiarity genre you recognize lots names . just disappointed when one these movies catches your fancy then you discover it not available video or dvd . this 2001 documentary begins asking , " what exploitation movie ? " easy answer not forthcoming , but you certainly understand evolution genre over quarter-century which it thrived . greene finds genesis exploitation discovery teenagers comprised economic market distinct rather broad category " children . " i am not sure if i would privilege arrival vampira scene highly greene , but you admit she makes pretty good poster girl movies under discussion . actually , youth oriented films ( e.g. , " i teenage werewolf " ) get rather short shift " part i : fast furious , " although it introduce roger corman work a.i.p. explores idea there examples exploitation films might actually meaningful ( not their creators aware such depth ) . there also emphasis idea exploitation movies it how you sell these things matters more than whether or not they any good ( because they usually not ) . court rulings obscenity set up " part ii : sinema , " which most interesting part documentary because greene shows how industry got sex films dealing miracle birth " hygiene " issues , nudist camp films doris wishman , nudie cuties films harry novak . once exploitation films go " across great divide " part iii , we get emphasis blood gore impact sexploitation films we get what called roughies . so if you not interested sexploitation you going disappointed " schlock ! " because this where greene able make his best academic arguments . really . you only look so many naked women greene analysis interview clips wishman novak lot more interesting . final section returns corman see what he up 1960s looks how what happening end decade ratings system " midnight cowboy " ended up sounding death knell exploitation flicks . concluding argument today all movies examples exploitation , during end credits while we watch people walk poster " godzilla " ( " size matter " ) , which reinforces idea today all movies " exploitation " definition . it interesting see these filmmakers point out today movies their best days weeks when they open , which trademark exploitation films their heyday , versus way movies major studios would build momentum over time . terms dvd extra we begin behind scenes footage sexploiters harry novak ( takes us tour his office ) , dorish wishman ( interview outtakes ) , david . friedman ( demonstrating typical " sex hygiene " book pitch ) . then greene talks " sci-fi : science symbols " short clip television documentary we short , " atom eve , " surreal industrial film early 1960s produced connecticut yankee atomic power company , which uses buxom dancer leslie franzos sell nuclear power ( greene wryly notes card introducing this one , " obscenity eye beholder " ) . audio extras there kpcc radio interview greene , songs " your one only original lizard brain " " under rug , " latter johnny english , who wrote soundtrack music liked it enough add lyrics make it song . matter , you listen entire soundtrack . there exploitation art gallery ( most which pops up documentary ) , credits filmmakers also credits talking heads forrest . ackerman doris wishman ( which samuel . arkoff , peter bogdanovich , roger corman maila nurmi a.k.a. vampira ) . you also find audio commentary track greene , co-producer wade major special guests really continue explore topics broached documentary	1

here italian cannibal movie i continue find there isn't much exciting this genre . again , we mostly controversy over killing animals which i really don't find either disturbing or entertaining all . i am also little bored seeing kerman movie . there really one scene where they could taken movie ' too far ' but they held back . i hoping they would take things too far .	1
i think biggest problem this movie people think they're supposed take it seriously . ummmm , no . it satirical comedy , not straight comedy . all indignant people who pan this movie saying it stupid taking it way too seriously . course it stupid , it satire . ( warning , some minor spoilers , but they don't matter much ) i mean , love interest nun , he mails himself vatican , he spends whole movie trying get cup capuccino his parole officer tries get him commit crime . think da vinci code meets laurel hardy .	1
jackie chan great even wild-wes t.t his movie just plain fun ! exactly what it meant ... not true western , not hilarious comedy , just plain fun	1
you know , this movie great . it some performances die , some most awkward dry humor out there , simultaneously hilariously funny deeply disturbing , relatable characters one either recognize or realize chillingly exist right next door ... or sometimes your very own house . it really great movie , especially utilizing todd solontz ' particular brand suburbia mentality . it just he didn't know where stop . mostly his relationships this film great , going surprising directions ultimately very telling type person he trying create . but honestly , we even need any side-story parents ? every time we got back them i got distinct feeling this five , ten , fifteen minutes i'd not watching other , better , more interesting characters develop . also , fat lady neighbor ; ultimately , her story came out end became worth it , but it most predictable least tightly defined all characters . i think todd solontz got little into " big cast " syndrome ( without actually hugely recognizable cast , save hoffman boyle ) express much widespread loneliness possible , but didn't think how much may weigh down otherwise biting in-your-face social commentary . it great movie , but it could even better . -- polarisdi	1
judging number reviews ( now 44 ) amazon , this 1943 western masterwork must relatively unknown . directed william wellman , starring henry fonda , dana andrews henry morgan , this tale mob ( posse ) rule frontier " justice " timeless , , unforgettable . film actually ensemble piece many fine performances . it should mentioned wellman cast black man prominent role preacher , which little unsual early 1940s . filmed bland silvery black white , absent here desolute beauty arizona desert or majesty colorado mountains , it appears movie made entirely studio backlot constructed sets . its great sense enclosure instrumental stark reality film inevitable conclusion . there very little action type normally associated westerns , but storyline so precise convincingly executed it moves quickly , almost too much so . say much more film content would giving too much away . film nominated academy award best picture wellman directed other great films , my favorite ( other than this one ) " battleground , " u.s. army struggle hold bastogne during battle bulge . " ox-bow incident " top my favorite westerns should staple any serious collector library	1

i'm not sure what i'm supposed expecting " classic eploitation/revenge " film , but if this it i'd say genre died just death . many reviewers pointed out , there simply fatal problems this film . sex scenes utterly awful , like they instructional film . christina lindberg beautiful , but don't expect any thrills her outside some decent lesbian scenes . lack music sound create claustrophobic feel , but this kind film i never tell if that intentional or just result piss-poor production values . " action " scenes almost all slow-motion which simply too slow robs scenes any sense real violence . i don't know why people go this kind movie . i think tarentino some sort complex : he feels guilty using kind production values he , while movies he grew up looked sounded like this one . he should get over it though , there nothing wrong movie looks sounds good , doesn't make you feel akward while you watch it . there little " rough " or " shocking " this movie , its just not very well . it interesting period piece , its cool i limited edition ( though it not numbered other reviewers pointed out ) , don't think this investment though , few more years , no one going care ...	1

i must say i'm shocked this film overlooked when it came big awards . why oscar voters hate love so much ? it because they're all shallow phonies out touch real human emotion ? i think we all know answer those questions , right ? heck , i don't go around calling people names feeling good it . but when film this caliber called " drivel " one critic " horse manure " . it sort gets my goat , you see where i'm going this ? thing , just because something happy ending doesn't mean it not artistic success , understood ? i could write all day how real art needs reflect life honest miserableness life , but who wants read realistic views like , you follow ? anyway , redford really phones great performance michelle . radiant tv reporter mad skills questionable attitude .	1

comedy bitter sweet edge , " purple rose cario " fairly simple premise . cecilia ( mia farrow ) struggles make ends meet during great depression . her husband monk ( danny aiello)is lout who cheats her gambles since losing his job cecilia work restaurant take laundry meet their bills rent . only escape cecilia going movies -- fantasy world hollywood gives her coccoon brutal real world . her favorite movie " purple rose cario " featuring gil shepard ( jeff daniels ) tom baxter ( also jeff daniels dual role)changes her life when character tom baxter walks out movie into real world . he says he love her wants her happy something no one else except cecilia sister cares . rest characters film ( edward herrman , milo o'shea , deboarh rush , zoe caldwell , john wood , van johnson)are pretty upset end up sparing audience watching them screen when they complain how boring movie . " purple rose " one allen most complete films captures all wistfulness lurks background his films . this dvd looks extremely good considering transfer 2001 . there some minor artifacting particularly when characters move quickly screen but , whole , it not big deal . allen hasn't commentary tracks allowed extras his releases which too bad there cut footage viggo mortensen michael keaton ( who originally cast lead instead daniels)that would interest . i don't know if footage still exists but if it it would make lovely addition this . why mgm didn't choose include archieved footage allen talking film new interviews stars beyond me . this oscar nominated ( best screenplay)film certainly deserves documentary its making or , very least , featurette . we get original theatrical trailer booklet discusses making film . great movie hopefully get better treatment when it ends up blu-ray format , " purple rose " still treat well worth picking up . it also priced well $12-14 most retail outlets amazon.com	1

whoever wrote editorial review sucks writing . also , this movie sucks	1
i gave two stars this movie exactly two benefits i gained watching it . these benefits illustrated next two paragraphs . there absolutely beautiful cinematography . depictions provence , region france adjacent both mediterranean sea italy , bountiful beautiful . director ridley scott showcasing scenes representing provence enough make one consider clicking " complete order " button 14-day european vacation extravaganza . catchy little tune alizee , " moi lolita " , made brief appearance movie which catapulted song back into my consciousness . song , course , one many attempts media capitalize cultural sensation vladimir nabokov controversial novel , " lolita " , but story entirely . * plot summation information below*the essence story tired clich� greedy , amoral pig finding meaning , love , purpose via simple equation : abandoned family estate + attractive native love interest + beautiful french countryside = happiness . max ( russell crowe ) wildly successful but unscrupulous power broker , who never met market he didn't want manipulate . following particularly successful business adventure , his assistant clues him possibility he risk investigated trade regulatory commission . partial solution , she his superiors recommend he take temporary leave absence company , preferably out country , until heat dies down . luck would it , max uncle recently died provence , since he left no , winery previously under his care automatically bequeathed max , he closest known relative . * end plot summation information*many complained sheer predictability plot , definitely negative aspect this film , but not necessarily terminal one . what kill my enjoyment film utterly nonsensical editing . scenes flash without any semblance explanation . cut conversation , seemingly no reason all , explain nothing , then cut next scene just one beginning soak up scenery . include several characters scenes without any actual suggested or implied reason their placement there . speed up action one or two semi-montage scenes vein physical-comedy film , no pre- or post-scene comedic introduction or resolution . finally , splice post- " fin " scene which could only described surreal . essence , this movie 200 mini-films spliced into one . least , that impression i got , it totally destroyed my suspension disbelief . there other negatives : lame stereotyping ( secretaries , americans , european humor ) , plots go nowhere ( " good " / " bad " wine secret " conspiracy " ) , humor attempts which only labeled " wince-inducing " , among many , many other detrimental attributes . not even worth renting , unless your friend already rented it , you cleaned all gunk you could reasonably expected clean out your fingernails already . romantic comedy lovers : this neither romantic nor funny , so if you just see handsome russell crowe or beautiful marion cotillard , buy poster instead . " gladiator " or " black hawk down " fans : no , even breakneck editing , it still not action movie . scenery fans : turn off audio , fast-forward " scenery " scenes , keep semillon flowing ... i would recommend three bottles per person	1
