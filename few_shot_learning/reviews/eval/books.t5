this book provides fine introduction myths northern europe . book examines few remnants we forms epic poems prose , written christian writers after fact - eddas , beowulf , viking sagas . these sources , especially edda , author reconstructs myths stories relating norse gods their subsequent twilight ragnarok . then , author seeks answer various questions this myth determine whatever relation it may original religion northern european peoples . figures odin , thor , loki , balder , rest norse gods play important part our european cultural heritage it nice see them presented introduction here . whatever underlying mental constructs behind such accounts ragnarok ( twilight gods ) they certainly appear universal human race , revealed all forms apocalyptic literature . ultimately these beliefs died rather easy death hands christian worldview . whatever your personal opinion replacement pagan beliefs christianity whether or not pagan beliefs should resurrected or remain buried , you certainly profit reading this book it help you better understand northern europe pre-christian times . finally , it must noted many ways , least my opinion , society vikings superior our own . i admire strong sense individualism vikings expressed enjoy greatly reading their heroic feats	1
i like evanovich novels light read few laughs , usually her hero heroine downright combustible - stephanie plum joe morelli relationship , sustained through 12 books so far , case point . but full scoop actually trial get through . i could hear voice there which distracting interrupted evanovich comedic rhythm . whole tone writing down five notches what i come expect evanovich . silly villains either too goofy or too violent , leaving us wondering we supposed amused or frightened ? least forgivable sins committed full scoop fact there absolutely no chemistry maggie zack . none all . so it hard label book : sort but not really romance , almost but not much woman-in-danger .... maybe new genre altogether - slapstick thriller	-1

eugene o'neill play " long day journey into night " pulitzer award winning , autobiographical play his family . i must admit though eugene o'neill considered some father american theater , i not enjoy reading this play . tyrone family insane dysfunction their constant bickering apologizing very annoying frustrating read . i also disliked fact after four acts continuous yelling tension o'neill offered no conclusion . day life tyrone family gets progressively worse until it finally peaks play just ends . no happy ending , no hope future , just despair . " long day journey into night " wholly depressing read i really could without . however , after learning more eugene o'neill background , extent which play based his life , i began greater appreciation this play . o'neill lead very hard life , therefore frustration despair i felt while reading this play demonstrates o'neill talent engage his audience convey emotions characters very real manner . while o'neill depressing end not satisfy my craving happy ending , it appropriate play eugene own family never got happy ending . i like clever way o'neill showed tyrone family desire but inability forget their troubles through dialogue . beginning play audience presented normal , loving family . audience soon however , gets suspicion something isn't quite right , family tense . slowly family skeletons exposed through arguments family members , but characters always feel regretful bringing subject up . thus showing no matter how hard tyrone family tries pretend all well , their skeletons always them resurface continually remind them truth . although i still believe " long day journey into night " thoroughly disheartening read , reader emotional response this play leaves no doubt o'neill exceptional writing .	-1

i clearly not share enthusiasm some reviewers here , who all forgive me thinking susan cooper " dark rising " plain awful . this book recommended harry potter fans who run out hp books read . i must say it waste my time read " dark . " never i read book which no physical description given hero . this case , we told his 11th birthday , english boy named stanton discovers he last " old ones . " unlike jk rowling who , first pages harry potter philosopher ( or sorcerer ) stone , provides reader vivid description harry skinny , unruly mop black hair , startlingly green eyes , , course , lightning-bolt scar his forehead , cooper not describe stanton all . result reader , after read 244 pages , still cannot visualize what looks like !! i also find quite annoying cooper approach this good vs . evil tale . she vague abstract till end who exactly old ones , who or what exactly dark . dark evil , all reader succeeds gleaning dark means cold , snow , -- course -- darkness . excuse me : but this best cooper ? this what this book ? -- druid pagan worldview light vs . dark , summer vs . winter , warmth vs . cold ? what happened conception evil moral evil ?	-1
i agree reviewer who said this work boring . it seems roth trying glorify philip roth not characters . he goes describing overwhelming feelings zuckermann " swede " , without letting us know who swede really . roth should let characters tell story or try use less erudition his narration . it gets point where reader loses interest finishing book . i loved plot against american because it more character based than philosophizing historical context times	-1
expose power hungry woman not give hoot civility compassion . riveting its revelation anna wintour icy personality even sun cannot melt ! though it not official autobiography , it well researched consistent views given most 200+ interviewees who worked or contacts anna directly good enough sound judgement anna character report card minus 100 anna personality traits !! those who think official autobiography would it more justice , i would say anna wintour would probably give very skewed account her favor would make it more " unofficial " than this unauthorised one . it makes you more determined than ever never work these abnormal people who show such traits . if earth needs sacrifice some human beings aliens invading solar system , anna wintour would surely make it top hit list people get rid !!! :)))))) i find it incredible there willing sacrificial lambs willing work this woman hell ! i just think those who work , constant contact or live her their morals twisted beyond belief , they no longer differentiate what right or wrong ! good example this would bee shaffer , daughter anna wintour , who recently remarked british newspaper , daily telegraph , which bee monthly contributor , her mother nickname " nuclear wintour " just myth ???!! excuse me ??, bee this sayquote bee daily telegraph , uk dated 5 oct 05 : " but it such myth me . she just comes into office she goal : she wants produce great magazine , which i think she . you work very hard she very direct what she wants . i don't think makes her ' nuclear wintour ' or whatever they call her .	1
i very much looking forward recieving this title amazon.com after reading first few pages online . , admittedly , i like first few chapters ; however , tone style presentation changed very quickly , became almost smug self-aggrandizing . authors seemed far too pleased themselves , , approximately halfway point i felt if i reading some kind bizzare conservationist manifesto . i like think - self-appointed conservationist vegan - i try mind mother nature all living creatures , but after i finished reading this repetitive , pedantic bore , i lost care . maybe i am too harsh , but this book seemed peak first chapter ; then , it became exasperatingly preachy redundant . others liked book , that fine ; but i disappointed	-1

this book excellent explaining labyrinth arabic grammar . it wisely introduces verb forms groups consistent vowelling participle formation which easiest format i've seen so far . it explanations remarkably clear . i think advantage since one authors not native speaker they able explain clearly other non-natives what native speakers probably take granted . it also consistently scrupulously vowelled ( essential grammar text book . ) other users remarked however , book not without flaws . conjugation charts wretched . everytime i look them , i get confused forget how conjugate verbs . print quality , others said , not greatest . vocabulary end each chapter bizarrely not alphabetical order ( english or arabic ) order seems quite random so looking up words pain ( there decent root-based dictionary back however . ) indeed sentences exercises quite stilted . check out this gem : " we described all these events you so you may know piety preferable despair , we put our ideas our many letters you during period two years . " come again ?? ( this before translation . ) still , they designed illustrate reinforce grammatical concepts they quite well . interestingly my teacher , who native speaker , hates book because stilted wording bad examples- e.g. illustrate 10 verb forms , they use some verbal variants don't actually exist . finally , it really bugs me they use egyptian style printing final " ya " which means they don't put dots underneath . thus , it looks identical character alif maqsura . there whole chapter defective verbs ( those end wow , ya or alif ) authors actually say " look how ya changes alif maqsura some these examples . " well , actually i can't tell guys because you didn't dot your letters . absolutely unacceptable grammar book designed non-natives would make this omission . despite this book flaws , this excellent guide arabic grammar especially considering other options amazon price you'd hard pressed find better deal . if you studying your own , there also teacher manual available	-1

although anne made some excellent points , it still one-sided . she still speaks republicans general better which wrong because many them just hypocritical democrats ( some worse because they know what god commands but don't actually care ) , although she gives some explanations why republicans better party , they deceptive wrong . example republicans better because they promote chrisitianity specific their arguments : yes , true some ways , however many promote false christianity make it look bad because many them not truly christians but putting up show . needs said otherwise people get impression often all christians hypocrites it all financial gain or vain glory . merely specific argument doesn't make argument better . example i say , " democrats out get your kids poor because they want raise taxes poor give tax cuts rich want force children learn white wash " but so called republicans like george bush want too . i would like say this good book give young girl , because it shows you still fememine , wise , christian , yet not fool or knowledgeable emotionally immature ( other words nerd ) , but it too many big errors . it helpful howewver everyone general who wants know what wrong some type arguing how argue constructively . although she doesn't give thorough explanation subject , it very good concise . i just happened comforted her words because day before attacked vagueries pastor aog church	-1

it mark twain who popularized aphorism benjamin disraeli there three kinds lies : lies , damned lies , statistics . i kept hearing all these marvelous things freakonomics , book steven levitt stephen dubner , so when i ran across it 25% off , i stupid freakin ' thing bought it . i thought , what freak , i've got pretty inquisitive mind i'm open seeing things differently , discovering new viewpoints . doubt started early when i got book home i first noticed glowing comments dust jacket likes time , new york times , washington post , los angeles times . when all liberal news agencies lining up tell me how wondrous certain publication , i'm immediately going freakin ' suspicious . author malcolm gladwell tells us cover , " prepare dazzled . " well , evidently ol ' malcolm dazzled whole lot easier than i am . ( i won't even mention smug mug stephen dubner taunted me book dust jacket because i don't want you get idea i judge book its cover . or this case , writer his physiognomy . so i won't mention . ) if you're kind person who amazed learn 70% auto accidents occur within 10 miles driver home , then you just might dazzled freakonomics . if i tell you company issues its 5-day-a-week employees only 3 uniform shirts , thinking it cutting costs , probably increasing its overhead , this fact astounds you - if you must ask " but how ? " - then yes , buy freakonomics dazzled . mostly what freakonomics offers ( when its conclusions trusted ) just what we used call " common sense . " but since america reduced bunch corpulent , brain-dead zombies staring vacuously box survivors , american idols , lost knuckleheads , good old-fashioned common sense now appears dazzle dead ( when you sever them box put real book their hands , ) . i dove into freakonomics hoping find my purchase worthwhile . i got no further than page 13 when my fears realized : everything would require second-guessing verifying . page , smug mug tells us ( based single report institute medicine ) " drinking eight glasses water day never actually shown thing your health . " fortunately , i read your body many cries water doctor . batmanghelidj over decade ago so i already knew what bunch bunk . chapter 4 , smug mug " proves " legalizing abortion 1973 roe . wade decision responsible national drop crime rate . this represents centerpiece his book , both literally ideologically . first thing reader must accept there really significant drop crime since early 1990s . page 92 , author acknowledges police atlanta discovered underreporting crime early `90s hopes landing 1996 olympics . well , would police forces nationally incentive underreport crime generally if it actually dramatically increased since `90s predicted ? true , honest might means increased budget , but it sure would make your department appear inept unable maintain control . surely chamber commerce big business interests would frown public perception . let me ask , you actually feel you're less likely victim crime now than you early 1990s ? that funny , me neither . there so much crime now some what once reported police agencies goes unreported , recently , ex-police officer friend told me cops no longer engage some micro-policing they able `80s `90s because crime so out-of-control now . dismissing other possible factors responsible huge drop crime ( if this claim verity ) , dubner states increased police personnel accounts only 10% drop . bit more insight into nature police work than average civilian , it funny i find myself even contending stats smug mug uses actually work against his theory : i believe wide-scale hiring police officers since early `90s could impacted crime rate only minimally - less than 10% - while actually increasing municipal coffers via traffic citations significantly . dubner concludes righ t-t o-carry firearm laws " simply don't bring down crime . " ( sure read utterly fascinating book , gunfighters , highwaymen vigilantes roger . mcgrath , decidedly different scholarly viewpoint ! )in dismissing all explanations unexpected drop crime except legalized abortion , i didn't notice any mention tremendous increase homeschooling proliferation private schools since early `90s , i wonder if might some statistical bearing . ya think ? yes , i think smug mug selective . he calls some abortions " crude drastic sort insurance policy . " not " immoral . " not " sinful . " but then i didn't expect smug mug call sin sin . even if levitt dubner hypothesis correct , abortions lowered crime , fact remains not every aborted child would eventually murdered innocent person , but every aborted child innocent person murdered . so why we even discussing this ? i'll tell you why : because pro-choice folks feel slightly shifting consensus , now they're pulling out all stops , trying " statistically " convince masses they're safer all those unborn potential criminals missing . i find this repulsive ! ( there studies indicating those missing people , continue , negative economic impact society . ) i won't even go into chapter 5 , what makes perfect parent ? suffice say usual ( surprise ! surprise ! ) all statistics dubner employs nearly always seem confirm rightness liberal dogma each issue . funny how those crunched numbers always crunch conservative beliefs . just know if you're working mother , you haven't cheated your child least , but if you're dad who thinks occasional spanking order , you " unenlightened . " if your kid watching lots tv , it isn't turning " child brain mush . " ( no word whether or not it turning his/her morals mush though . ) studies ( we called pay attention ) show " child character wasn't much affected whether or not he sent day care , whether he one parent or two , whether his mother worked or didn't , whether he two mommies or two daddies or one each . " ( i've often wondered what might happened me if my mom , who home most time , hadn't there hammer dangers drugs into my head day after day , year after year , while i growing up `60s `70s . ) i've given freakonomics two stars because i find section naming children very interesting , well story stetson kennedy fight against " three ks . " but if you're smarter than i am , you'll borrow this book your library rather than paying money it . economically speaking , that just " common cents . "	-1

far shakesepare comedies go , " comedy errors " always my favorite . while this " you like it " never quite obtained popularity " midsummer night dream " or " taming shrew , " one probably could argue " you like it " best shakespeare comedies . this play contains several plots shakespeare cleverly intertwines it offers happy ending love triumphant . but more important than triumph love , theme reconciliation carries through virtually everyone story . story begins sibling rivalry orlando his older brother oliver who hoarded family inheritence . after brief fight , oliver hopes orlando may accidentally die wrestling match against charles . this where 2nd plot comes . duke frederick ( who daughter celia ) banished his older brother ( true duke who daughter rosalind ) . but now , rosalind allowed stay she made good friends celia . orlando meets these 2 girls falls into favor rosalind . after wrestling match , things start go bad . orlando learns his brother oliver planning kill him , rosalind banished . but all not lost . orlando takes his loyal servant adam flees while rosalind ( male disguise ganymede ) , celia , comical touchstone flee look rosalind father . here where play becomes mostly comical . ( good comedies often sad start . " comedy errors " shows this well . ) moving , we meet rosalind father his crew who made exile into paradise . duke sr party , we meet melancholy jaques . but he arguably most interesting character story . ( fact , most famous passage this play belongs jaques . 7 stages man which end nothing . perhaps macbeth took lessons jaques : ' tomorrow , tomorrow , tomorrow . ' ) duke sr welcomes orlando adam , it isn't long before orlando rosalind run into each other . shakespeare maintains comedy when rosalinde keeps her male disguise tells orlando he must practice wooing him/her . touchstone some comical romantic moments audrey . there interesting triangle where shepherd silvius loves phebe , but phebe loves rosalinde ( seeing only ganymede) ! we may recall this " 12th night " when olivia loved viola her male disguise . but after this comical moment , all begins resolve . oliver comes scene he celia fall love . ( so much so oliver willing reconcile orlando grant him all . ) play ends not only reunion rosalind her father , but joyous weddings rosalind / orlando , celia /oliver , audrey /touchstone , phebe / silvius , but more good news comes . celia father mends his ways returns all rosalind father . jaques offers crowning touch . despite his cynical nature , he not villain . ironically , this hermit type man converses more characters than anyone story , while he not take part play final happiness , he wish everyone well . i said , my favorite comedy always " comedy errors . " but don't make mistake overlooking this comedy	-1

if i didn't know any better , i'd swear this book written satanist . author seems rejoicing prospect armageddon , including mountains blown up destruction all world cities . i bought tatty copy one penny i somewhat surprised see 1973 it its 27th printing . it seems reasonable then assume mr lindsey views fairly representative mainstream america . if that case then suggests plenty americans keen armageddon erupt middle east so " good christians " may whisked off private audience . christ while rest population burns . i would recommend this book all israelis . his book last days israel , zionist author barry chamish declared israel main enemies european socialists . well , i reckon hal lindsey his fans present greater threat . it seems likely if supposed temple solomon not rebuilt israel isn't annihilated then lot committed christians going most upset . bit " good news " lindsey book surviving israelis convert christianity such passion they like " 144,000 billy grahames " . it seems committed christians charge both uk us governments us government could described theocracy . i wonder if theocrats share views mr lindsey , who states this book each arab generation hates israel more than one before , which would good news it would mean they would more likely attack initiate armageddon cause return jesus christ . russia portrayed villain book , but " red china " " red chinese " get look-in chapter entitled " yellow peril " . book however contain one true statement , page 120 : " religion great blinder minds men .

i've software industry quite awhile , i've watched personal computer industry evolved one where there dozens machines sold consumers down two primary platforms windows macintosh . while there no doubt macintosh minority platform , there also no doubt its continued survival engendered unexplained amount hate those who not fans machine . this book , summary , longwinded rant one such user . someone who knows first hand number situations covered book , who generally solid understanding situations not covered book , i believe author this book sat down wrote it out himself without any fact checking , without any real interviews ( or he ignored or misunderstood people he interviewed ) . there so many factual errrors this book , its not funny- -from little things like years events happened or locations companies or person who held particular role particular time , grossly innacurate assumptions things author could not possibly know -- such minutes boardroom discussions . this smear job , thru thru , like most smear jobs its repetitive , self-contradictory , downright dishonest . i think only reason author not sued doing so would give this book far more attention than it deserves . windows fans like kick apple mac , even when they down . windows seems engender some sociopathic sadism people . if you want learn more apple , find book ... this book just windows fan bashing steve jobs taste	-1

okay , this book out long enough there more than one review , so show my support , i add one here since i missed his book tour sf mere two days . i can't believe it . i just don't read newspapers all anymore . didn't book come out august ? but they wouldn't tour him august . it like december : business shuts down like jewish girl after her wedding night . just well . what would i , anyway ? lurk ? smile ? try say something unusual charming ? not gonna happen . book tours exhausting so speed-dating author series blurts too much . best read his blog his site his own name . i'll remove this review later because i like private ( i remove all my reviews ) , but this cockfight book , quick stabs , perfectly designed actual writers attention spans too short actually read real paragraphs anymore . it got so much teeth-baring energy irreverence someone who handle running into anyone street . we're talking courage , baby . no cowering here . [ way , writer/artist friends , read rollo may courage create see this all diagrammed out . ] eszterhas ' last book , hollywood animal , started out fine me , but end i wash my face afterwards . there just too much anger testosterone before he wrenched himself his previous hollywood life . he escaped hand-in-hand naomi his kids safety ohio like von trapps " sound music . " but perhaps bad-writing stories too close home , i felt same way nyc publishing world i sprayed my vitriol into many folks ' eyes , too . it burns like mace . but you can't imagine how it feels us inside . times like those , we one shrill ladies jerry springer . one . you hear me ? that very bad , bad place . splotchy skin , fishbelly texture all . ( don't you get springer pin up calendars ? )so i read around reviews before buying this hardcover . i'm cheap my own library readers who wonder why i quit writing books . too many books my excruciatingly tiny apartment it . so i also read joe queenan ny times interview , but i smile condescendlingly all through it , because writer , it really just smacks jealously bitter sibling sarcastic riff . ( when someone sees peer excel breaking very rules they've so assiduously following , it blows their cotton-picking minds they might've cheating themselves all these years . ) it cute little review , but i think critics just snide wannabes who should forced write each review gynecological chair , showing little pink room full people eating cheese talking cell phones . artists forced take take take again every word like sweet young thing our first night clink . but i like idea queenan fine . i miss philadelphia terribly , think everything everyone there great . except main line . it hard funny or cool main line . geez , thread count cityline avenue alone rivals finest egyptian cotton sheets . but he lived city once , right ? worked there ? bought four pretzels dollar once his car ? anyhow , i don't know where he lives but his writing smacks main line : well-to-do middle-aged guys trying just little too hip , surly , smug when there absolutely no longer any reason angry " young " man . if you afford frog , i don't wanna hear any bellyaching . our personal thread counts tell no lies ... besides , whole philadelphia area , anyone who knew john debella since ' 80s , when he wmmr head-to-head howard stern , knows he only one who gets play card all happened his wife all . talk your life publicly dragged behind old pickup truck fun . old " louie louie " parade yore should just parading him around everyone shoulders once year . but what i know ? queenan funny when he writing impossibility doing his own thing like trying make original $7500 movie under guise trying take down yet artist , robert rodriguez ( tsk tsk , looks like somebody needs hug , queenan ) . but queenan mere boy . it eszterhas who dirty dozens -- verbally disembowel best ' em any street corner -- still parts intact saunter off any actress who happens passing . so too bad he got sit there take ny times article like someone who his home number written truck stop bathrooms all over world . i feel him . there no back alleys critics . rest us ? -- yes . / critics ? -- no . they jam their thumbs their ears wiggle their skinny little weak fingers air skip off into night . ( ... where special chair ? )so i'm glad see readers stepping up giving eszterhas last word . it beautiful thing see artist triumph over ubiquitous critics his audience . i think posters aztec warriors around here ... eszterhas standing mountain top ... loin cloth pinned together regulation no . 5 brass fasteners . only two . formerly long malibu-blond hair blowing mountain wind , scantily-clad screenwriters napping his feet . anyhow , i surprised how much i like this book . it what it . i cringe while hearing creepiest side hollywood where scientologists ( religion cyborgs cash registers ) thrive next blockbuster producers , women seem plastic straight-faced janet jackson treat themselves like blow up dolls . it horror movie we're eating what they're farming ; i get so tired all those boys down there literally metaphorically poking all our faces , collecting our heads like shish kabob . but when i read it life advice writer , i'm ecstatic don't want it end . i'm always struggling where put tantrums my life like punctuation . if that what you want need , then don't listen any critics or people taking eszterhas down peg or star . it deserves all five stars just its relentless audacity . but hey , it pert ' darn near un-american not want bash anyone who much anything --- heck , it even hard me not joe queenan bash any baby boomer who ever more than one house when most us barely come up insane down payment one . ( i so don't wanna hear or see any more documentaries or books your " good ol ' days " ' sixties ' seventies , when rent bottle beer free-love hug . you all free time world stare ceiling , lovin ' , make " ground-breaking " art .... blibbedy blabbedy blue ... ) . but my pale , quivering writer friends , take him down ( new snide way we've all perfected ) your own peril ! reading this book like knocking back whiskey smoking too much our sailor suits , back bar eszterhas before he says : " okay , kid , i warmed holly ' up ya . go there show ' er how it !... oh , uh ... way , quit smoking . " --- then sends us off hollywood pick up where he left off , our shaky knees -- but blustery hearts . who cares whether you like his movie work or not ? that absolutely irrelevant most people know . we're all puerto rican here , whether you speak spanish or eat smoked herring also irrelevant . we writers spend too much time hunched over , writing others getting proverbial girl -- even if we girl . but we rarely swagger real life get our own girls . but he . smarmy or not , you've gotta hand it guy holding his own . this book doesn't need cover , it needs cod piece . all that relevant . we need this call war . because technology boredom what out there , things ' changing tectonic shifts taking place we've got psych ourselves up writer power like any self-respecting black panther would've ( back day before their name became used hip hop clothing line ) . there special way dial perfect combination so you " make money without losing your soul " he writes . but i'm almost forty , don't clue what it . i shake my shoes ask " what ? what exactly would jesus if he wrote his own book tried sell it ? " even though i haven't foggiest idea , i go make muffins because i figure jesus would make muffins because they hard make ( read : " sacrifice " ) , they make people so happy muffin kinda ' way ( read : " giving " ) . few weeks ' time , i'll back my old self , but here california , you've got least pretend you're outwardly " nice " every once awhile , some widely-accepted faux-spiritual zen-buddhist bowing way or they chase you up hill eat you like guy liz taylor/kate hepburn movie , " suddenly last summer . " ( yeah , yeah , hipocrisy abounds here . but you put up lot sunshine . ) anyhow , that what this book joe like : hungarian muffins . sure , there occasional shard glass , but it makes your teeth sharper . makes me happy . i'm terrified go back out there business because i don't care how spiritual you fancy you , when you're finally busy you've living ramen noodles so long your kitten danger around thanksgiving time , holly got you her electrically-heated embrace --- oh my oh my oh my -- it so hard think straight . vonnegut once wrote something nature surviving often creepy because survivors usually questionable things order survive . true . history full prematurely dead people who right thing . how you balance keep your ear against wall hear click right combination ? i don't know , but i'm gonna sleep this book under my pillow so i benefit somebody else hindsight 20/20 all " if i knew then what i know now " cliches . writers gods . i still can't believe movies " " director . it silly . but that what one last writers ' strikes , yeah ? they blinked . then they caved . eszterhas doesn't cave . i don't even think he blink .... because screenwriters gods .... not gazelles disemboweled serengeti . same bravado , i've writing my own first novel into my own screenplay myself , am calling my production company " monster girl movies .

string theory formidable subject learn , both physical mathematical standpoint . but it even harder subject teach audience non-experts , not because its ideas hard express verbally front this audience , but because its practitioners sometimes feel it beneath them so . those who not familiar string theory but curious its conceptual foundations might therefore left themselves pursue understanding these foundations . however such understanding obtained , there late few books written experts string theory targeted readership strong desire learn subject . author this book recognizes paucity expository material string theory , particularly dealing mathematical formalism , although this book polemic against string theory its status physical scientific theory , author introduces ( perhaps purpose ) reader theory way understandable without sacrificing scientific accuracy . but book could also interest more advanced readers , i.e. those ( such this reviewer ) who thorough understanding physics mathematics behind string theory but who not conducting research it . author demands rightfully scientific theory must testable or least must some amount empirical predictions . he pulls no punches his critique string theory , very open what he thinks motivations behind those who actively involved it . researcher motivations course not germane validity theory he or she proposes , but they relevant understanding why particular theory entrenched scientific community , even though there no experimental evidence it . this reviewer disagrees author his claim string theory not " beautiful " theory . it mathematical formalism used string theory gives it its beauty . indeed , just algebraic geometry alone employed string theory example this . combined differential geometry , complex manifolds , algebraic topology makes string theory beautiful multi-faceted mathematical gem . said , there many ideas string theory deserve classified " speculative " mathematics , author this book . this classification arises because presence ubiquitous path integral , object resisted rigorous mathematical formulation . so yes , mathematical formalism behind string theory beautiful , intoxicates those who contemplate it . but physical theory must more than just " mental masturbation " ( characterization imputed physicist murray gell-mann book ) . it must also make predictions measured laboratory , these measurements must reproducible above all understandable interested parties . author not find any these predictions string theory it exists present time , he correct his claims . those who worked academic setting understand fully negative reaction author received when manuscript circulated review , which he describes some detail book . this criticism course anonymous , following usual practice research community , such anonymity temptation recklessness vituperation , author gives examples this . so book not only describe some ideas string theory , it also goes into social interactions attitudes among string theorists . it would unfair say all string theorists arrogant protective their status academicians . but those meet this characterization position cannot morally justified . discovery scientific truth demands transparency not only because complications theory , but also because those who not directly participating it responsible it financing ( taxpayer ) . string theorists , all scientific mathematical researchers morally obligated report their discoveries those who not their field manner makes it crystal clear what they all . string theory should not collection documents protected interpreted small body privileged priests knowledge .	1

this book excellent introduction " big " history modern-day afghanistan , providing overview empire building collapsing ( either afghans pushing outward or others pushing inwards ) , succeeding waves tribes armies moving through region , etc . anyone interested understanding afghanistan some historical depth it , this book one i would , consequently , recommend . where author falls flat , my opinion , when he begins pontificate how united states should pursued its intervention nation . this instance he betrays minimal level understanding ( " where light parts 1st infantry division ?

i very much looked forward receiving this book through mail , due tons praise which people expressed it . i am however very disappointed . i only read first few pages ( including first one which quotes multitude praise ) emphasis summary/chronology south african history . i am south african , i find it littered inaccuracies which should not present history book . it painfully obvious book written foreigner . examples : boer war becomes " war whites " . i would liked see rand revolt mentioned name . botha becomes prime minister . botha who ? pik ? pw ? newcomer sa history should not guess such things . 1981-1988 south african forces invade angola . uh .... no . sa started incursions into angola 1976 . since this history sa , i point out quick scan book reveals no more detail around these events , yet he takes cheap shot afrikaner government making it sound though they willy-nilly went into angola sake oppressing people . it seems author opted avoid explaining historical facts behind these very important events . what reader not know , fidel castro through this period time circulated 350 000 ( if i remember correctly ) cuban soldiers through angola infiltrate southern africa communism , through war sponsored soviet money state-of-the-art military equipment training . south africans responding this threat avoid spread communism into region ( it rumored cia condoned this until withdrawal vietnam ) . simultaneously civil wars other southern african countries tied this , well soviet military training anc members such thabo mbeki others . events surrounding incursions into angola tremendous complexities tied into it direct cause effect role interaction government , apartheid era crackdowns , african political organizations . author not discuss these influential details modern history book scandal . he chooses refer province we officially call kwazulu-natal , kwazulu . overall first few pages not bode well rest book , but i report back when i'm reading i t.t his report-back : after reading book i realized my initial harsh criticism borne expectation purchased detailed history book . after realizing it not , i eased my expectations somewhat despite errors . overall book readable but superficial summary south african history , anyone who wants claim they balanced understanding south africa history cannot so without read further than this source . book clearly written audience ( perhaps freshman university level ) who need first-order introduction sa history . this sense book fairly well written but omissions essential events several factual errors prompt me rate it 3.5 stars . i rate it 2 stars however , because this book marketed authoritative book sa history , praise desmond tutu title book misleadingly suggests . it nothing kind ( least i hope it not best there !!!!! ) . i think praise this book received outdated inappropriate today day age title should read " summary sa history " . since author seems update book time goes , adding chapters , he cannot excused not filling gaps , correcting errors previous chapters , adding details . book therefore seems propagate gaps recorded sa history instead aspiring become accurate detailed authoritative reference time goes . it pity . one more comment : least one reviewer advised take last chapter grain salt since it appears too pessimistic him . i couldn't disagree more ! last chapter - apart few opinionated ( would subtle foreigners)statements author terms seemingly continuing make africans underdogs caucasians antagonists - factual , accurate ( perhaps even understated ) recording dismal deterioration sa society incompetence government played out 94-2000 . continuing trend these events clearly seen everyday south african news up this day .	-1

first time i became acquainted wally lamb , i read " she come undone " english lit course . like many other i adored book , but hesitant when i picked up " i know this much true " two reasons . first , it seems like nowadays truly incredible books hard find . so what chances finding two same writer ? secondly , sheer length book ( just under 1000 pages ) little intimidating first glance . given my previous experiences lengthy modern novels , i ready big let down once again . yet , i pleasantly surprised find one best books i've read , ever . wally lamb such great job when tackling seemingly controversial topics most writers wouldn't dream touching . worked kids suffering behavioral/mental disorders i impressed his potrayal not only effect schizophrenia individual , but also effect people surrounded individual . granted he adds your occasional plot twist add " story " ( twins , flashbacks , ex-wives ) he still manages hit nail head . both dominick thomas so well rounded you feel angst pain every treacherous turn battle both fight against thomas disease . novel evokes every human emotion possible end you may find yourself smiling ( or frowning ) through tears . i know i love book make this happen i recommend it anyone who looking something absolutely incredible . even better yet , despite length book i couldn't put it down . far it one easiest 900 page reads i've ever picked up . my only complaint , book come end .	1
arguably robert heinlein best work , starship troopers classic piece science fiction displaying earth future galactic war against sentinel race giant bugs set destroying humankind . story told through eyes juan rico , member mobile infantry . rico explains how he joined mi , some his adventures , how he rose through ranks . starship troopers actually more book philosophy military thought set against backdrop society which only people who vote those who served military ( makes one think term " citizen soldiers " completely different ) . far action story , starship troopers doesn't much offer . much book given dialogues explaining philosophy book promotes . also , many action scenes more concerned military strategy than describing action . however , i found most meaningful works sci fi those deal deep philosophical issues or social ills . starship troopers isn't everyone . however , it piece classic sci-fi worth reading if you don't mind not read lot action sequences	1

there irrestible desire compare this 800 plus page novel russia stalingrad leo tolstoy much longer novel russia napoleon moscow 1811 , some respects they alike . both superb . both express russian love homeland . both extol russian defeat invader . both bring russia past up close . but there dirrerences - substantial diffeences . tolstoy portrait painter words writing two generations after fact . grossman there time he damn good - photographer words . tolstoy romantic ; grossman unblinking realist there nothing " sweet " what he tells you , upside down orwellian morality stalinist state , where evil good , where good rewarded evil , where bad things happen again again good people no reason other than fact they somehow innocently run afoul some small deail machinery party . example there colonel pyotr novitov who exemplary officer commanding tank corps stalingrad encirclement . he through retreat across russia 1941 now , staffed again fine division , he move regain caucasus ; he love yvengenia shapsonikov who formerly married nikolay krymov commissarin red army . she given him every reason believe she loves him too come him field . but krymov , who served party faithfully without stint over years , set up , horribly beaten nkvd lubyanka pison moscow , forced confess politcal crime sentemced labor camp . yvengenia stands novikov up goes back krymov . then novikov suspended his command instance commissar his division ( politican named getmanov ) because he paused rest his men ten hours after advancing battle without pause everal days ( getmanov wanted division first into caucasus ) recalled moscow political punishment krymov type . i cite this example - one many similiar stories - typify tone this book - unremitting , steady black gloom . nothing good happens anybody - ever . sons killed , mothers sent gas chamber , families riven distance over whole deadful scene , hovering like deadly miasma death , stalinist state , cruel , dishonest , cynical fundamentally personification evil , just bad nazis - maybe worse because it purported represent common man . so should you read this book ? absolutely . while it would help understand how spelling russian names apparently changes gender while you ned chart characters better than one back book ( i finally made one my use ) while you really need some knowledge russian history post 1916 - revolution , collectivization , famine , purge 1937 etc . - you go it alone see how morally obscene communism really - particularly under stalin . you need . this angry book written without sunlight angry man writing death evil stalinist state cold gray dead winter 1943 stalingrad . tolstoy leaves you thinking mozrt , grossman writes dirge - but he good . very very good . read it compare	1

this fascinating , original take what lies ahead . rather than project single future , authors joel . barker scott . erickson examine existing trends group them into five regions technology . they explain each technology , extrapolate future it might create if it alone shaped world , then discuss how these different technological currents might intersect . barker erickson paint their five futures broad swaths . this allows them cover lot ground sketch many potential markets challenges , but it also means they cover their ground shallowly . five technologies they examine , they far more solidly grounded " super tech , " " limits tech " " nature tech " than " local tech " or " human tech . " they sometimes treat individual place them categories their fans might dispute . example , science fiction author isaac asimov long-time supporter population control limiting power machines , but he found here super tech rather than limits tech . these small nuances should not take away your enjoyment this book , which we recommend managers who want plan flexible , productive future , those who enjoy mental experiments challenges , since , times , it simply fun read	1

political memoirs usually disappointing . they're self-serving , self-aggrandizing ( i met blah , then i met blah2 , my wife loved his wife , blah blah blah ) , humorless pretentious . most all , they're boring . after all , constant name-dropping , self-justification glossing over any failures gets dull after , say , 20 pages . senator ( possible vice president ) john edwards ' book refreshing oasis among political memoir desert . one , it more focused than usual political memoir . sen. edwards before he senator already renowned fearsome trial lawyer . this book focuses mainly four trials sen. edwards won his 20-year career . john edwards likes consider himself warrior " little guy . " his first trial he highlights his book settlement he won alcoholic who given huge dose antabuse left completely debilitated neurotoxic drug . i couldn't help but admire edwards , who when he took this case rather inexperienced . many trial lawyers not take cases former alcoholics , they don't exactly make most sympathetic plaintiffs . but fact edwards refused settle fought this crippled alcoholic imo shows compassion . johh edwards this book comes across quite differently his television persona , which unfailingly sunny , even sweet . here he sounds fiercely determined . i thought if i corporate lawyer i wouldnt want mess edwards . particular he describes outsmarting " other side " courtroom -- he seems particularly fond letting unsympathetic witnesses dig their own graves . he describes personal tragedies ( like death his son wade ) there palpable anger towards irresponsible doctors companies . his book occasionally maudlin -- his descriptions his wife kids , example . book written mostly flat , inoffensive prose so prevalent these kinds memoirs . john edwards too young war hero ( la john mccain ) , but despite lack overt heroics i came away sense admiration john edwards , his fairness determination	1

this excellent book read order understand ( general ) what life like average russian soldier wwii . author drew recently de-classified russian sources well numerous personal interviews veterans soviet army . i struck many times wretched conditions soviets fought - whether poor supplies front lines ( soviet soldiers never issued socks , but instead long " ace bandage " type linens they wrap their feet up ) , uncaring opportunistic communist bureaucracy would award medal soon declare you criminal or simply shoot you . course there many stories ubiquitous political officers their attempts propaganda . one thing missing , noted , stories individual actions " fire-fights " . author attempted address this universal unwillingness veterans discuss these aspects here or simply state they couldn't remember . i believe her , book reveals wwii eastern front so very brutal , 1 ) scorched earth tactics genocides both sides , 2 ) almost no opportunity escape exteme weather conditions , 3 ) ruthless use manpower russians ( some sources state 15 soviet soldiers killed every 1 german soldier ) fighting mostly conducted animal-like fury no one wishes remember	-1

this book certainly moments great insight . emerson passion quite clear often well-articulated . but this very lengthy book , many essays no longer much offer they perhaps once . there several invaluable , course , but many them simply become too obtuse arcane really relevant anymore . i read book all way through , but my recommendation would people purchase it simply reference , maybe read more famous essays now again . end , many essays disturbing undercurrents racism or anti-democratic sentiment emerson inability see nature dark force , it sometimes , sinks large portions book . we must bear mind emerson writing different time his comments now unacceptable not always way . clearly this book historically important , it obviously worthwhile one sitting shelf quote or occasionally reference , but it certainly not bulletproof guide living many made it out	-1
let freedom ring , sean hannity sends out subliminal message he his writing truth , justice , american way . just title represents everything true good him america . his five-star reviewers his message reinforces their pre-conceived beliefs hannity words validation those beliefs . if this written ghost writer , he should withheld payment . if it wasn't written ghostwriter , hannity should one his next attempt literary hyperbole . first chapter written maudlin , " those-were-the-good-old-days " wistfulness his immigrant grandfather who he describes honest man integrity , believer american dream . but before you say " erin go braugh " he talking courage george . bush standing up terrorism . exactly how g.w. , he doesn't elaborate . how he goes grandfather dubbya bit magic . hannity next trick impugn clinton gore soft terrorism . his source this , all people , dick morris who knew clintons now works fox republican advocacy network . he quotes morris who makes such vague statements " it seemed they afraid talking terrorism , " or " they seemed indifferent terrorism . " these " morris mind-reads " conjectural , but hannity uses them , which he impunity . let take closer look hannity unimpeachable source moment . it dick morris who quit clintons shortly after second election . it morris who penchant streetwalkers , some jail time , entered alcohol rehab . you'd think sh could find better source if he expects freedom ring ! but , hannity doesn't skip beat . he points out how democrats such senators kerry daschle voted against certain defense-spending bills . what he neglects inform his readers reasons they because riders attached bills , or number republicans who also voted against same bills , or many defense bills kerry daschle vote . he never once advises his reader defense spending programs killed dick cheney when he secretary defense . such deception called propaganda . propaganda something hannity no compunction using here . this he continuing tell tale long since debunked . namely , it story president clinton offered osama bin laden sudanese government . again , it what he doesn't say misdirects reader . sudan made offer hope economic sanctions against them slave-trading , lifted . however , fbi determined sudanese playing us because they neither ability nor intent handing over bin laden . sudanese also made offer saudi arabia , but saudis revoked bin laden citizenship , refused take him . benjamin franklin said " statistics liar . " hannity uses charts same purpose . he shows how under reagan , army bought over 500 tanks . under clinton , army bought none . this leads one assumption clinton nothing services . he doesn't mention army buys tanks , not presidents . he doesn't mention army all tanks they needed armored warfare against soviet union never came . he doesn't mention army began changing its warfare strategies which would include more transportable fighting vehicles . grateful hannity cannot rewrite famous works literature he attempts history . if he could , instead seeing dead captain ahab killed whale " moby dick , " we might just see grinning captain standing next tethered whale caption : " i caught fish this big ! " there something very fishy his facts , his historical parallels which aren't parallel , what he chooses tell you , what he chooses leave out . this book , he tells whale-sized whoppers !	-1

good dream interpreter offer multiple possibilities which you might pick . one make sense you surpass " reasonable " or " plausible " attain " feeling right . " similar sense , i enjoy franzen essays most when they elicit instant affirmation . those moments , you nod , say he hit upon something , notice what nifty way he found express what you should known before . surprisingly , he seldom achieves exalted state when he speaking personally , himself . he seems more effective when he triangulates his own views contributions other smart people . reading this collection essays , you occasionally detect prickliness makes him -- rightly or wrongly -- literary bad boy . his indignation veer into stridency . however , you also see sort warmth , me , corrections sometimes lacked . franzen suggests his essay " why bother ?, " i read confirmation life complicated . its best , how alone so way suggests not just solidarity franzen -- those he quotes -- but what franzen observes	-1

i over 30 years experience strategic thinking consultant planner . i constantly find people totally different concepts what strategy all . each tends either too focused one area , or incomplete some aspects . result , people logically arrive some pretty bad strategic conclusions . typically , this involves strategy organization cannot execute well or which competitors quickly negate . what i like this simple book it nicely summarizes case balanced perspective customer , competitor your own company . although most american companies believe they this , american approach much more superficial incomplete than japanese one . example , if japanese company wants add new product , evaluation looks heavily how well customer able use product how effectively company able provide it context probable competitive offerings . american analysis feature financial analysis forecast often based little more than spreadsheet doodling . weakness japanese model they typically look too little business environment ( notice how often they buy american businesses properties top market inflated prices ) , relatively insensitive financial implications . fast moving technology markets , japanese consensus-building process also tends slow down time market . clearly , there no perfect model strategic thinking fits all situations . major weakness many efforts assume future precisely forecast . patently wrong . typically , relative importance elements considered needs adjusted fit circumstnace . seems art rather than science this point . although this book its limitations ( suggested above ) , it valuable perspective strategy thinking helpful most american business people if they think concepts more thorough way . balance perspective here , i suggest you also read profit patterns get sense how circumstances play role profitability . good thinking ! may this book help you overcome any stalled thinking you not doing your home work thinking outperforming competitors provide benefits matter lot customers .	1

i just wanted add my own $0.02 already great reviews this book gotten . if you're like me , you'll hard time learning other methods primarily use sound/sight recognition memorization ( like rosetta stone ) . this book , however , takes very common sense ( logical , my opinion ) approach learning russian . example , it not show you verb conjugation just expect you memorize it ( like most russian books/materials seem ) - its approach , instead , first show you how conjugate variety verbs . armed this knowledge , you then step into useful examples . others recommended here , i also recommend finding course or tutor attend addition learning this book . i took cheap ($100 ) non-credit class semester local university ... it wonders - minimum - native speaker communicate . book great job sounding out difficult pronounciations , but it only go so far while native speaker could correct you spot minimal effort . sure , this book available online here $12 , but don't underestimate value learning language interactive environment ( don't even begin think such minimal investment all you need )	1

mcknight concerns communities ' dependency professional assistance legitimate , but disturbingly overstated this book . end i felt mcknight trashing already well-trodden government provision social services may not altogether helpful distressed communities . he sidesteps concerns capital mobility exploitation pernicious effects wrought years discrimination . any debate over when where how social programs effective cast aside well , since mcknight picture , social programs professional service providers , fact , vilains culprits most what ails society . one damaging fallacies seems perpetuated this book service professionals not able both professional caring - two deemed mutually incompatible . mcknights views resonate employers ' caring rhetoric - conveniently invoked every time healthcare worker tries claim she care patients but still entitled living wage or , perhaps , health insurance . what further implied communities readily ably take up reign providing themselves their members when denied more institutionalized professional services . it seems implied communities no problems before social programs solve them came into . this , i think i see mcknight invokeing idealized notion society earlier time ; maybe his argument would seemed more reasoble time when families less geographically mobile may constituted economic unit , when elderly lived shorter lives less numerous themselves more children care them , local economic activities more functionally interdependent . but mcknight model today cure doesn't seem fit today conditions . other hand , mcknights solutions may only ones available society where budget cuts elimination social services seem prevailing trend .	-1

before i even opened book start reading it , i already coming it filled particular expectations . i actually think we often/always approach books , among other things , this manner . this case , though , i fortunate enough aware what those expectations beginning . particular , given valerio past associations this bridge called my back this bridge we call home , i looking forward race feminism figured more centrally testosterone files than other ftm texts ( memoir otherwise ) . while no means i exhausted entire genre , i'd say my readings thus far , i've hard-pressed find ftm text leaves me feeling satisfied its treatment race . so , admittedly , testosterone files lot live up ... perhaps too much . frankly , i'm torn ... i'm definitely glad read book , well own it . i proudly display it my bookshelf ( where self space high premium ) . trans text , i think its focus testosterone ( opposed surgery ) helps stretch boundaries genre , how we think trans itself . like other ftm texts , there much focus body its physical transformations , but because emphasis isn't surgery it offers something those readers who either want transition without surgery , or simply transition live without surgery due other constraints ( e.g. , affordability , or lack thereof ) . even though valerio makes clear text he experienced discomfort his breasts , it because lack able afford top surgery he hadn't surgery ( well , until he wrote this book ! ) , need surgery becomes undertone text -- ever present but not overwhelmingly so . instead , what dominates talk testosterone . " hormones really work . " it realization valerio seems taken aback . he writes , " hormones ... i'd read testosterone its dramatic effects his [ lou sullivan ] booklet , but i never my wildest dreams imagined it could this good . this transformation miracle " ( 103 ) . like other similar texts , valerio describes changes his physical body undergoes he begins inject testosterone -- disappearance his extra fat , coarsening texture his hair , changes his skin . interestingly , valerio also describes changes his bodily emotions undergo effects testosterone . i say bodily emotions here because valerio makes clear it not just emotions disconnected his body , but precisely way which his body , because its changing chemistry , processes emotions differently than it once , ultimately resulting different physical manifestations those emotions . specifically , he finds testosterone limited his ability physically cry he once , instead increased his aggressiveness . when i first encountered these testimonials his how women biologically predisposed cry men fight , something me tightened . my initial reaction get defensive wonder how text i thought would so feminist could so blatantly reinforce traditional gender stereotypes . then i remembered there grains truth most stereotypes , what important not overcompensate trying make argument not all women cry drop hat , or men cry , but rather respect honor valerio experiences . this way , testosterone files , invaluable me challenging my understanding myself feminist , gently helping me grow further into kind feminism inspired me beginning -- one not only prized difference , but saw our power coming those very differences ( thanks audre lorde ! ) . i said earlier , however , despite ways which testosterone files added my knowledge understanding man transformation , i disappointed race wasn't more central issue throughout text . there moments when valerio writes his native heritage , his mother reserve , passing white some times , latino others , but these but moments , conversations race don't seem sustained throughout . end , i feel like book valerio wanted write testosterone above all else . respects , he succeeded . book i wanted valerio written negotiating racial feminist consciousness politics context ftm transition . i recognize my disappointments testosterone files not valerio failings , but rather signs my own longings .	-1

dr. thomas sowell book , " conflict visions " attempt explore primary , if unarticulated , philosophy historical conservatism liberalism . his thesis conservatism tradition operating vision humans sees them ' constrained . ' some characteristics this view :( 1 ) humans generally selfish natures . ( 2 ) human reason , while valuable , quite limited . ( 3 ) because this , society grows evolution , not central deliberate planning . ( 4 ) social decisions generally involve not ' solutions ' but ' trade-offs ' ( how much good how much downside ? )(5 ) procedural fairness , rather than results-based fairness , key just society . conversely , sowell writes liberal tradition operates vision humankind ' unconstrained . ' features include : ( 1)human selfishness quality overcome reason education . ( 2 ) human reason , when used properly , trump human impulses , emotions , feelings . ( 3)the planned society best . non-planned societies = chaos . ( 4 ) while policy trade-offs might good short term solution , reason discover true solutions equitable all . ( 5)procedural fairness not fair so long disperate outcomes result . sowell backs up his thesis impressive research , citations , quotes . this refreshing becuase it makes sure he not simply creating strawmen . conservative side , his quites tend come edmunde burke , adam smith , freidrich hayek , oliver wendell holmes . liberal side , his quotes tend come william godwin , marquis de condorcet , jean jacques rousseau , ronald dworkin . ( one who read all these authors , i assure readers there no strawmen here . ) only murky part book sowell makes this vision sound too simplistic . while he acknowledges not all thinkers fall into either one or other category ( even chapter marx mill - two thinkers borrow both sides ) , some his choices people quotes exempify each ' side ' less clean-cut than one might like . libertarian , it strange me see edmunde burke ( who valued tradition more than most anything ) friedrich hayek ( who valued innovation capitalism more than anything ) same group . ( holmes not necessarily best jurist exemplify ' strict construction ' contitution ) . [ it would interesting see , then , appendix ideological divorce libertarianism conservatism . ] other ' side , ' i kept thinking , although william godwin might good example someone who believed reason virtually omnipotent , he also liability sowell case , godwin not believe planned society whatever fact , anarchist who against planning any form ! while examples aren't perfect , sowell didn't intend them . all all , it good book i think sowell argument good one , most part , true . some other books similar vain - exploring ideological divide sides - try george lakoff " moral politics " e.j. dionne " why americans hate politics .

davidson trying solve age-old problem " unity proposition " . proposition socrates hits plato different heap socrates , relation hitting , plato . this corresponds semantic fact " socrates hits plato " sentence , whereas " socrates , relation hitting , plato " not . frege ineffectively tried solve this saying verb ( " socrates hits plato " ) denotes something which " unsaturated " , i.e. holes it , thereby enabling thing link up , proposition-forming way , items flanking it . frege theory radically confused , davidson noted many times . ( one thing , it absurd result thing corresponding verb " hits " hole it , whereas thing corresonding noun " relation hitting " not . but how this , given both expressions presumably pick out same relation ? frege gave absurd answer we cannot speak properties way we speak individuals -- this embodied frege dictum " property horse not property " . ) rightly rejecting frege view , davidson produces one his own , which -- like much his previous work -- involves dubious reliance tarski work relating definability truth-predicates formal languages . throughout his career , davidson often tried turn tarski technical points logic deep semantic metaphysical account . davidson also seems found support tarski work some extremely strange , i believe , false doctrines . tarski disquotationalism -- " snow white " true iff snow white -- apparently inspired davidson think ( ) there no propositions ( sentences enough ) , ( ) there no facts , ( ) predicate " true " corresponding property innocuous somehow vacant ( this supposedly evidenced apparent equivalence " snow white " " it true snow white " ) ( ) there no difference meanings truth-conditions ( tarski talks truth-conditions , not meanings ) . none these doctrines any real support tarski work ; davidson attempt give them support - particular , his use spurious " slingshot " argument prove there no facts , consequently , sentences not made true anything -- involved rather glaring fallacies . davidson views truth based complete failure see past phonetic surface structure indicative sentences . purely orthographic point view , " snow white " less complex than corresponding nominal : " snow white " . but semantically story very different . both encode proposition snow white . but " snow white " something additional : it manages ascribe truth proposition . ( how this delicate matter . ) once semantic anatomy " snow white " laid bare , it becomes impossible sustain idea truth-predicate innocuous or concomitant idea nothing makes sentence true . davidson views these matters projections folk-syntax , source annoyance anyone who ( unlike davidson ) gives any credence work chomsky other depth-grammarians . identity predication , unique blend obscurity , indirectness , flabby logic vitiated much davidson earlier work full bloom . further , he doesn't really add anything wasn't already found his earlier papers . philosopher , davidson some fine moments . his work scepticism original ( though unsuccessful ) . some aspects his work semantics -- especially his excavation logical form action sentences his scathing criticisms ( " theories learnable languages " ) frege bizarre views indirect discourse -- philosophical classics . but this work , davidson not his best , this exposes certain lack focus pervaded his career . scale 1 10 , i give it 2	-1

i loved anthony swofford gulf war memoir , jarhead , but no disrespect its author or kirkus reviews which calls it " israeli jarhead " , company offers far richer reading experience . american-born watzman served almost 20 years israeli military , starting regular army 1982 , moving reserves ' 84 . this period covers broad swath modern israeli history , watzman brilliantly demnstrates how he able ( overcoming personal conflicts ) mix his political views -- anti-settlements -- his soldierly duties , which often required defending settlers unapologetically executing missions which he opposed principle . his company contained people across full spectrum israeli politics ( die-hard expansionists socialistic peaceniks religious zealots ) . watzman showed exceptional dedication doggedly reporting duty year after year into middle age , leaving his work wife 4 kids every year report front-line duty , when so many his peers easily managing escape reservist service . even after illness left him permanently disabled almost crippled he'd passed his 40th birthday ( ancient footsoldier ) , watzman insisted doing battle his adopted country . he true hero patriot wonderfully entertaining writer .	1

we know some things saul tarsus ( later named apostle paul ) but complete biography always lacking because sketchy incomplete information . most everything we know paul dr. luke book acts or paul epistles themselves . ii peter chapter 3 makes some very intriguing statements . peter , some his last earthly words before martyrdom , validates paul apostleship states some his writings teachings difficult but we should follow them . pollock book presented documentary-style reading since paul complete biography not entirely clear . there much author states inference or speculation . if you respect not build doctrine facts where evidence fuzzy , i think this excellent book . one example " fuzzy " facts pollock considers age-old controversy over authorship book hebrews . author hebrews not identify himself scholars argue who wrote it . pollock speculates paul , while imprisioned acts ch . 24 two years may time motivation write book people he so desparately wanted reach . his imprisonment his controversial style among jews , he may left his identity anonymous so he himself would not stumbling block reach his jewish brothers . eternity reveal who wrote book hebrews but it certainly plausible theory . overall , greatest benefit reading this book provide better framework understanding paul he travels among early churches wrote letters them correcting various false teachings problems developed .	1

this deeply flawed book . it purports description characteristics attitudes make wealthy people wealthy , but it based mostly their self-assessments without comparison control group . i suspect this heavily underplays role random chance success , attributes causation where there only correlation . further , author displays clear biases number topics , which leads him engage ad hoc interpretation his data , sometimes argue conclusions contrary clear implications data -- such his arguments importance religion lives millionaires . pp . 33-35 , author looks success factors , compares role luck pp . 82-85 , which he downplays favor discipline . while he touches importance right connections ( genetic contributions intelligence ) , . 85 he asks " what luck graduating medical school ? what luck successfully running medical practice ? very little , according these physicians . " but what luck born into family country where one chance reach adulthood , let alone able attend medical school ? quite bit . unlike its predecessor , which looked prodigious accumulators wealth ( paws ) vs . under-accumulators wealth ( uaws ) , this book focuses millionaires ( paws ) decamillionaires ( tiny subset paws , those net worth $10m or greater ) . lack comparison general public serves limit book value . misleading comparison businessmen stockbrokers pp . 76ff makes point . stanley states former occupation more likely higher net worth . but this comparison misleading because he only looking millionaire-plus sample ; he excluding more total business owner population his sample than stockbrokers . average median income net worth business owners likely lower than stockbrokers . if he made same comparison actors or musicians stockbrokers , example , problem more obvious -- excluding all those who aren't worth $1m or more up front , you exclude vast majority , pull up average . stockbrokers , other hand , higher percentage them top income earners wealthy . . 110 , after pages importance ethics advising " never lie . never tell one lie . " ( . 55 ) , he passes right over his example , mr. warren , lying college graduate order get job , without comment , without noticing hypocrisy . pp . 173-174 , author wants make point prayer important millionaires dealing stress , despite fact majority his surveyed population not regularly pray . ( he repeats this again . 370 , saying " nearly one-half millionaires ( 47 percent ) engaged prayer . ... significant percentage millionaires , their religious faith major force their lives . " ) trying emphasize point ( . 174 ) , he splits his sample into " religious millionaires " ( rm ) " other millionaires " ( om ) , observes 75% rm engage prayer while only 8% om , points out this " ratio more than nine one . " this meaningless comparison , however -- rm make up only 37% his total population millionaires , so his " more than nine one " ratio really nothing more than saying , those millionaires who religious , three-fourths hold religious practices which involve regular prayer ( 8% those who not consider themselves religious pray anyway ) . since om population much larger than rm population , absolute numbers that not nine-t o-o ne ratio -- his numbers show 28% his total sample rm who pray , while 5% his total sample om who pray -- closer six-t o-o ne ratio . but more importantly , author glosses over fact not only majority millionaires not religious , even quarter those who don't engage regular prayer ! given u.s. one most religious countries world , fact such low percentage millionaires religious quite interesting worthy further exploration cause , but stanley , religion prayer important foundation " millionaire mind , " he completely misses opportunity find explanation why millionaires so much less religious than general population . later table book . 366 , he shows activities engaged sample 733 millionaires during preceding 30 days . table includes 52% attending religious services , 47% praying , 37% attending religious events , 22% bible/devotional reading . these numbers don't quite match up rm/om data pp . 173-174 , which seem show even lower levels religious activity , but these still lower than they nonmillionaire population -- weekly church attendance notoriously over-reported surveys . work mark chaves , . kirk hardaway , p.l. marler 1990s found actual percentage attendance half what surveys show . this actually could mean millionaires attend more often , if stanley survey results don't similar over-reporting . author religious bias further leads him recommend student going through divorce she , despite not church attendee , search mate joining church group ( . 268 ) because she " believed marriage traditional family concept . " he writes " i believe one likely find better prospects church setting than singles bars . course , there no guarantees , but people religious orientation more prone respect principles espoused good book . " but why he just guessing this ? hasn't he asked his population millionaires -- ones who 63% non-religious -- how they met their mates ? he this , very usefully , regarding how millionaires purchase their homes ( pp . 315-326) -- yet isn't picking partner even more important ? this book some interesting data , its best when giving comparative results populations ( e.g. , house-purchasing characteristics economically productive millionaires vs . non-economically productive millionaires chapter 7 ) . but it doesn't stand up well comparison millionaire next door , which much better book	-1

i loved earlier nevada barr mysteries , their depiction national parks natural dangers . i wasn't happy some her latest efforts , but still hadn't given up her . now i'm not so sure . this latest novel started off well enough although idea two severely traumatized girls should clue what would follow . idea they polygamous mormon sect red herring . perhaps it barr attempt show us how these girls abused even before they met evil incarnate . scenes where anna realizes who real villian her interaction him poor tortured third traumatized girl went over 60 pages . each scene more disturbing one before it . i found myself skimming pages still am not sure how she resolved all loose ends . but i absolutely no desire re-read end book find out . i wish i could say i would read nevada barr novel because i so thoroughly enjoyed first ones . but after reading this disturbing , somewhat convoluted story , i would think twice . if i pick up anna pigeon novel , i'd make sure i something else read if story took dark turn . i would certainly not stick it end .	-1

what would you if you could drink elixir removes all guilt your mind few hours allows you partake things you normally would never dream ? robert louis stevenson gives us glimpse what could happen " dr. jekyll mr. hyde . " it wonderful classic originally published 1886 . it , well-worn battle good evil played out not forms hero villain , but inside mind soul one man who toys idea acting out his most carnal ( least that what reader assumes ) longings . this isn't your cookie-cutter hollywood version " jekyll hyde . " it much deeper study human soul it longing bit " naughty " suffer none consequences . time again , jekyll drinks his " liquid courage " unleashes evil lies within . days , weeks months pass , jekyll finds it harder control beast within , his unholy friend makes more longer appearances . eventually , mr. hyde goes too far one his escapades , it drives jekyll brink sanity . way , we introduced characters such utterson his friend enfield . we also meet poole , dr. lanyon , brief appearance , maid servant who witnesses actions against one mr. carew . although jekyll hyde title characters , most book focus placed utterson . jekyll gets one chapter ( final one ) which give his account what happens him he undergoes his changes . most films plays based this book portray doctor good , wholesome man . however , while reading this book , i found he perhaps more evil than hyde . he capable controlling his desires . hyde not . instead prohibiting himself taking more elixir , jekyll openly enjoys it . he begins lose more more control his situation , he attempts correct his own wrongdoing . when this occurs , we find one thing hyde fears . this particular edition " jekyll hyde " features rather humdrum introductory essay vladimir nabokov . my opinion , he goes depths stevenson probably never meant uncovered his morality tale . skip introduction if you unfamiliar story . it nothing more than spoil your read . i recommend afterword dan chaon . it much more interesting , less depth look this brief , wonderful story . i highly recommend tale . it gets five stars , but introductory essay drags story down makes it almost boring . therefore , i give this version " dr. jekyll mr. hyde " four stars	-1

i always thought boundaries way keeping others safe distance out my personal business . instead , after reading this book , i learned boundaries also way connect others , allow greater closeness intimacy people our lives . order this , we need cultivate something author calls " boundary intelligence , " which intentional management three aspects boundaries : their permeability , flexibility , complexity . four elements boundary intelligence : awareness , insight , intention action . it makes sense -- if someone stepping all over us , or if we trespassing their boundaries , we need first all aware transgression , then insight realize we need adjust our boundary permeability . then we form intention change formulate plan action address boundary transgression . all us different boundary styles , interesting quiz chapter 3 helps us understand our inner boundaries ; those we others our lives ; how their complexity , flexibility , permeability all impact our dealings others . i found this very interesting helpful . book several other quizzes , but they lacked enough explanation me make real sense them . throughout book , numerous anecdotes examples tell boundaries trampled ignored , all which further illustrated necessity understanding learning how successfully negotiate boundaries people our lives . one area dealt something author termed " emotional trespass . " this when " we may not know exactly where our boundaries , but we know when they've violated . " i think innumerable examples this my own life , but i never way describe it before . armchair interviews says : boundary intelligence help you navigate your way through all relationships your life .	-1

lo que en el lejano 1997 comenz� siendo un entretenimiento , un osado intento de que los ni�os adolescentes espa�oles se aficionaran la lectura conocieran un poco de esa historia que hab�a desaparecido de los libros de texto , se ha convertido , al cabo del tiempo , en la mejor serie de novela hist�rica en castellano desde los episodios nacionales de galdos , en el plano internacional , el mas vivido �pico retrato de una �poca desde la trilog�a de los mosqueteros de alexandre dumas . igual que , despu�s de dumas , ya no fuimos capaces de ver al cardenal richelieu sino como al maquiav�lico villano en la sombra , tras p�rez reverte al gran quevedo no lo podremos imaginar sin la espada desenvainada el " no queda sino batirse " . en eso consiste el genio de la novela hist�rica : en ser veraz , ser puntilloso en descripciones lenguaje adem�s dar vida esos datos fr�os que llenan las biograf�as en las enciclopedias . dar vida los personajes hist�ricos no consiste en coger un fara�n , un emperador romano o lo que sea ponerlo descifrar enigmas polic�acos . consiste en tomar personajes reales , con sus virtudes defectos , hacerlos actuar seg�n las propias reglas de su tiempo su car�cter . el gran arturo , tras mostrarnos en las otras novelas de la saga las mazmorras de la inquisici�n , las trincheras de flandes el puerto de sevilla , nos lleva esta vez al teatro . teatro con may�sculas porque nunca antes desde luego nunca despu�s , conocer�a la historia tal concentraci�n de genios dedicados escribir para un publico que convert�a cada estreno en un acontecimiento social . ah� estaba el capit�n alatriste , code�ndose con los poetas , encam�ndose con las actrices como no , salvando el pescuezo al mism�simo rey de las espa�as . vuelven el cruel villano malatesta angelica de alquezar , ese bollicao mezcla de lolita femme fatale . como no , all� esta tambi�n i�igo de balboa para contarnos como ocurri� todo . finalmente , como es habitual en perez reverte no faltan los " cameos " de algunos personajes actuales que el lector espa�ol ( no as� los ajenos la realidad espa�ola ) no tardara en reconocer . en cuanto al titulo , aquellos que no sigan la trayectoria de p-r posiblemente no adviertan el gui�o sentimental que esconde . " el caballero del jub�n amarillo " es , seg�n dice p-r en el prologo de su primera novela " el husar " , el titulo de un follet�n que el propio padre de arturo perez reverte escribi� hace tiempo , cuando el folletin era ya un genero muerto muchos cre�an que enterrado . posiblemente el padre de p-r nunca imagino que su propio hijo desenterrar�a el genero lo elevar�a cumbres no antes holladas . en resumen : un nuevo acierto del mejor escritor espa�ol vivo .	1

this book ecumenical sermon global implications hyper-consumerism . it contains little information specific ways reduce consumption , leaving it open readers discover techniques work them . instead , it focuses ethical philosophy consuming only what you need . but foundations this philosophy firm ? author seems use guilt motivating factor getting westerners cut their consumption . he repeatedly states individuals west should reduce their consumption habits , suggesting implicitly high consumption west depriving developing world money or other resources . paradoxically , reducing consumption west would deny wages third world workers who produce consumer products western markets . so reducing western consumption means make world better place implies very simplistic view economics . besides , western hyper-consumerism pales face displayed affluent easterners or south asians . more defensible reason reducing consumption would because it simply makes you feel better personal level . also , it beneficial family budgets when money isn't spent before it earned . leads healthier family relationships . book focused its arguments such issues would far more convincing than this one .	-1

english major i've my share anthologies . norton anthology theory criticism stands out me because it offers direct access writers their essays rather than filtered , explained , dissected discussions them . it allows opportunity explore what author say their own voice . unfortunately means some selections more difficult read than others . trade-off knowing what you reading source idea rather than reflection it . while i bought this book class requirement , reading it ( i am nowhere near ) offered me new perspectives not only view literature , but world general . probably best thing i say this book . worst ? it not light read -- literally ! tote this brick around campus semester not pleasant experience regardless how interesting essays	1

good part this book deals experiments conducted old school hypnosis . remember nancy school dr. liebeault your studies history hypnosis ? well , ormond mcgill brought them back life , so you'll get little bit more insight interesting experiments they used while hypnosis still used techniques mesmerism . i'm really glad all effort mcgill invested bringing back some valuable information enrich " modern " hypnotists - bringing life energy world hypnosis , because some intellectually oriented minds completely dropped energy out equasion due their own lack understanding . now , awareness using one mind work energy happily emerging west one may even thank proliferation eastern techniques methods ( india china - mainly area healing - sure , you've heard " chi kung " ) . west , these techings mainly wrapped mysteries reserved only those who inclination esoteric studies different occult practices . there two other books i recommend supplementary reading workbooks together this one - they ormond mcgill " hypnotism mysticism india " franz bardon " initiation into hermetics " . they help you better develop skills use techniques this book . after describing different experiments performed century or two ago ( matter , you find many other more modern books numerous other mind-over-matter experiments ) , ormond guides you through some practical techniques so you conduct your own experiments these techniques . book directed those who interest using them stage shows perspective , stage mentalists who only learn how use " tricks " make audience believe they something they not doing , benefit learning how able genuine mentalism instead faking using art deception . this account there some authors who entirely focused area deception because all they know all they aware , they live convinced everything comes even close it must some kind deception . but where here smoke , you rest assured there fire , too . even though they ignorant fire way how produce real effects , it doesn't mean real thing cannot . respect , i recommend this book all those " stage mentalists " who so far acquainted themselves only techniques producing different mind effects through trickery . they may surprise themselves what they able accomplish . this book also benefit regular hypnotherapist who no intention get involved any stage performance . they learn how add more power their hypnotic techniques , using power their minds , working energy direct thought transference , instead just using words . they may also become aware fact their own beliefs expectations , even though unvoiced affect outcomes they get their clients because there always silent communication going mental level it goes beyond subtle cues body language ( minimal cues , they called nlp ) . book called mindreading , but techniques covered also used what we call " remote hypnosis " or " remote influence " . it doesn't matter whether person sitting next you , or room , or even country - when you work mind energy . distinction made book contact non-contact mind-reading . contact mind-reading also used dr. milton erickson . here practice some essential nlp skills may helpful order good this , you'll aware subtle ( minimal cues ) given off person . it somewhat like " lie detector " , except instead machine , you using your own observational ( calibration ) skills notice subtle physiological differences person - this case through touch . non-contact mind-reading involves clearing your mind receiving mental impressions - something alike doing remote viewing , though there remote viewing techniques may go little bit further than this . those interested incorporating mindreading techniques this book their stage show , ormond mcgill provides several different routines spice up show .	1

this very important book , seeing it gives us access lives ideas normal americans , how racial dimension affects them . book includes 17 interviews various persons , including families couples . author edited himself out it , so it more like 17 monographs than 17 interviews . although not much new under sun me , book should read every fully european descended person america , show them they not alone their thoughts . recent poll i read time magazine ( all things ) , showed 70 % european americans found it important keep their race alive , so fact there no major racial awareness two big parties us , should point fact something not right american politics . there should large basis identity politics even among european americans , i'm confident such party become large quite soon . people book various experiences , vary their age sex . author very objective unbiased , which rare books this touchy subject . people interviewed sometimes bit gloomy outlook , but seeing world europeans today , who blame them . i highly recommend book both already " converted " , those think racialists insane . both something gain reading this very interesting book	-1

if schizophrnic person killed someone blamed it angelic voices , would we then take position also blame angels , or would we just realize it person who crazy ? similarly , just because crazy people say islam(or christian inquisitions , or communism , or building colonial america ) their motivation violence , why look islam(or others ) when we should looking their craziness( i.e. unstated ulterior motivations ) instead ? so many large groups people tend oppress , kill , or enslave either other populations or those within their own borders . why believe their stated reasons it , rather than look more common thread : human population dynamics . sorry , he just who , instead sociologically looking violent tendencies almost all large groups people general throughout history across cultures , he simply wants attack islam . he may right what he says islam , unfortunately it doesn't really matter because it really just " red herring , " where he blames surface rather than cause : humans . religion so often abused " reason " crime , but haven't we realized we shouldn't believe what crazy people name their religion their religion ?	-1
called ' war peace ' version financial planners , i found this book surprisingly readable , its conclusions ( while obviously controversial ) least thought-provoking . there four large concepts beginning : increasing liquidity , safety , rate return , tax deductibility , considering ' big picture ' financial planning . it eye-opener read through his analysis how quickly taxes eat up any tax-deferred gain 401(k ) or ira , well how few options there saving both tax-deferred tax-free withdrawals . roth ira great but so limited , thus when you get main section book ( investing equity indexed universal life insurance contracts ) author delves into great detail how they work how they benefit you . many articles newspapers not look eiuls , they comparing book approach other universal life products ( such fixed-interest product - which reviewer below apparently , or variable universal life product , which isn't same , or whole-life product ) . i also found 7.5% return bit high , but after looking eiul more closely ( reading up sp500 returns historically ) 7.5% number used conservative one . douglas andrew gets into technical detail how properly setup eiul yield ' floor ' 1% ' cap ' 15 or 17% ; i.e. when sp goes down -5% , you still get 1% return , when it goes up 5% you get 5% , when it goes up 20% you capped 17% . although i found out these eiul around only last five years or so , back-testing this approach 50 years yields some 9.4% , it makes sense you getting upside sp investment without downside risk , thus it bit lower than historical 50-year sp return . this reviewer thinks ' hidden costs ' properly constructed eiul , 1% ( average over 20-year span ) very reasonable , pay both administration well insurance component , but it tax implications ( grow tax-deferred withdrawn tax-free ) seems too good true . i haven't started eiul policy yet , but am seriously considering it , everything i've able find not able refuted many confuse equity indexed universal life properly constructed implemented ( following tax rules/laws ) other vehicles similar but not offer kinds growth advantage nor cost advantage this . while it may seem extreme no longer fund 401(k ) its maximum limit purchase universal life insurance contract instead , tax perspective there seems compelling case here . least i convinced ( after paying mortgage off early age 39 my case ) money could put better use elsewhere	1

ira levin , hands down , best suspense thriller author out there . his novels quick affairs fun read but leave you thinking once it all over . like no other , levin make impossible situation seem entirely within realm possibility . robot housewives ? satanic babies ? hitler clones ? his career covers it all , circumstances just real enough make you wonder if it could happen you . " stepford wives " came out decade when feminism taking hold nation making future gender roles uncertain . would women leave home forever -- taking jobs away men who feel entitled them forcing them cook wash their own laundry ? not if men stepford , connecticut help it . through desperate , brutal actions stepford men association levin makes bold statements how women chained their home lives made sacrifice their own desires their very humanity sake their family . true success levin chilling parable how timeless it proven . sure , specific details become dated since 1972 publication date , but message still target -- just look tabloid-infused botox-ification society occurs today proof . " stepford wives " great summer read beach , vacations , or rainy days when you're stuck indoors . like " davinci code , " it intelligence woven into its pot-boiler outline -- but fortunately it better writing back it up . it guilty pleasure isn't so guilty after all . aside : " rosemary baby " " stepford wives " ( levin most famous works ) suffer some fact now most people know what happens end , but don't let deter you . joy getting there still carry you through nicely ; fun no longer surprise twist but picking up clues get you there ( think it seeing " sixth sense " knowing bruce willis dead still appreciating movie craftmanship hid it original audiences ) .	-1

if familiarity indeed breed contempt , then perhaps explains why my opinion cooper most famous novel weakened over time . i recently reread book after interval many years ; not only i disappointed ( somewhat bored ) , but i realized it become my least favorite five leatherstocking novels .

( particular , psalmist named david gamut cooper jar jar binks . ) overwrought dialogue cumbersome even unintentionally comical ; only natty ( " hawk-eye " ) bumppo would deliver 300-word speech hush his compatriots order avoid imminent risk possible ambush . several things save novel its maudlin prose , they alone justify its status " classic . " first unexpected depth portrayal cora . modern standards , her character stereotypically feminine , but she pioneering heroine whose depiction violates nearly every preconception era . second aspect unhesitant ( its time ) graphic horror which cooper depicts hand-to-hand combat ; shocking episode opens massacre garrison still ability give me nightmares . , finally , there cooper decidedly " unromantic " willingness surprise reader killing off major characters startling ( believable ) twists plot . set aside cartoonish characters , overstylized prose , speechifying dialogue -- story alone worth read . so it not bad book any means , opinions depend taste . i prefer character-driven narratives almost pastoral mood " pioneers " or " prairie , " which times seem anticipate survivalist novels willa cather . those who prefer swashbuckling action " ivanhoe , " however , this book	-1

this extremely well written summary first 35 years patrick o'brian/richard patrick russ/richard ross life . nikolai tolstoy superb job mapping parallels unattested portions his step-father life through detailed analysis o'brian 3rd autobiographical novel , richard temple . tolstoy interpretations measured credible . while critical certain points dean king portrait , he avoids getting excessively embroiled their differences . what i still am loss understand exactly what prompted o'brian name change end wwii , particularly given richard russ operated richard ross while working what appears one propaganda branches british intelligence during wwii . tolstoy teasingly describes how richard russ a.k.a. richard ross assumed identity academic phd italian university . richard/patrick escaping these lies ? other area remains unexplored patrick o'brian craftsmanship . tolstoy certainly makes clear russ/ross/o'brian leveraged many his life experiences when writing his short stories ( many themes reappear aubrey/maturin series ) . but how largely uneducated writer evolve such potent writing style . tolstoy himself no mere scribbler . writing very clear moves reader effortlessly . but what his subject beautiful style ? tolstoy apparently access manuscripts this earlier period . they tell us anything ? finally , i believe this book help readers look characters aubrey/maturin series , especially female characters , new richer ligh t.t olstoy currently working part ii his o'brian biography	1

vasari lives lived over 450 years , it easy see why ! cimabue titian , he covers ( this edition)over 40 artists during 250 year period ! great artist himself , vasari spares no superlatives describing work lives these individuals . they just all " most excellent " , produced titanic painting , sculpture , architecture . he claims ( erroneouly , according editors ) one murdered his rival , definitely not nice guy . but rest generally given royal treatment . oddly , botticelli seems tad slighted . big three , leonardo , raphael , michaelangelo practically bathed light devine !. many anecdotes mentioned , which give real life sometimes fun these olympians . plus , discussions progress styles/ techniques which come full flower these big three .	1
this book wonderful . i feel it could used further editing though . instance middle " dry mix " section there recipe not make dry mix . freezer recipe section there recipes no freezing options . i guess it gives it real down-home feel say essentially " here how evaluate recipes ease conversion dry mix , here one didn't work " , but someone who skips around book rather than reading it straight through may miss some really great tips . i've used tips hints more than recipe section since i so many cookbooks , but if i never use recipe book tips hints alone easily worth it . buy it , read it , enjoy it . i give this book some kitchen items bridal shower gifts . i wish i would this information when i newlywed	1

m.r. james many imitators if you've read any ghost story anthologies all , you're probably already acquainted him . " casting runes " " oh whistle i'll come you , my lad " probably his two most collected stories , but they're all good . i still shiver through every one them , i've read all his stories least hundred times ( well , maybe ten times ) . his usual protagonist elderly ( or elderly seeming ) scholar , british course , who gets himself into horrible , occult trouble going where he shouldn't go or reading what he shouldn't read . there other good writers ghostly tales : sheridan lefanu , charles dickens , e.f. benson , shirley jackson , etc . ; ramsey campbell once wrote short story style m.r. james almost could written master , himself . however , if you haven't already read m.r. james ' " collected ghost stories " , please so . he writer which all others this difficult genre measured	1
this truly let down . i know after so many years it hard keep strip fresh . but jim davis shouldn't let garfield get so watered down . i've loved garfield since i kid , own all books ( number 14 my favorite ) , all other books davis released . i could pick up this book , go through it without finding joke new , or funny , which course huge let down . garfield not snoopy , where charles schultz made peanuts gang interesting funny long he wrote it . after reading this , you get feeling jim davis out new material 10 years ago , he just trying milk series all it worth . cats don't usually live well into their 30 , so i believe it time davis start thinking how let garfield ride into sunset scred dignity left . if you must purchase this book , stop your local bookstore leaf through it , see if you still like it . i love garfield much next person , but not this way	-1

read several different translations lysistrata , i report one you select may make all difference your opinion this early comedy . roche translation very vulgar but good footnotes : get ready cockney spartans , however . jack lindsay translation , 1925 ( included bantam edition aristophanes ) seems overly literary comparison original but lacks notes . it reads well , though sounds little old-fashioned . bawdry present but made less direct ; this one spartan dialect scottish . i found parker translation least satisfactory . " hillbilly " dialect he gives spartans painfully overdone , not mention inaccurate , speeches awkward pedestrian . excellent edition overall alan . sommerstein penguin classic " aristophanes : lysistrata other plays . " introduction notes extremely informative , translation itself strikes right note represent aristophanes ' style english . ( once again , though , spartans scots . ) but perhaps best choice sarah ruden 2003 edition . her dialogue unusually funny without straying too far original . added value comes her four very readable essays greek democracy , warfare , women , comedy . it also printed quality paper comes great cover	-1

it interesting see just how powerful applescript become . initially scripting languages not well suited general purpose programming because they lacked too many features and/or too inefficient . both these constraints gone away . computers so powerful , inefficiency doesn't matter . languages gotten enough features many cases applescript works just fine solution general programming problem . it time this book . up until now information applescript thin . now this tutorial published explain use language . i like mr. kochan writing style . he starts off you write program . if you type it way he says , program bug it . ( kind like my programs . ) way , first thing you see how applescript reports error . out way , you move learning language . it quite comprehensive book , talking things like classes variables , there quite bit string manipulation . course all usual things like logic , loops , files so . he saves description applescript studio until end book , way you learn more language itself ready when studio comes help make task so much easier	1

dashiel hammett , author such classics maltese falcon thin man , certainly deserves credit one originators noir genre . unfortunately red harvest doesn't live up this reputation . red harvest starts continental op arriving mining town personville ( sometimes called poisonville ) . he hired editor local paper , who turns up dead . this editor also son mining magnate elihu willsson , who called collection hooligans break strike . what he not foreseen inevitability criminals would take over town . originally i idea " red " title something socialist workers movement or wobblies , logical assumption since hammett communist , but hammett settles obvious , red meaning murder after murder continental op turns criminals against each other . blurb back book lauds hammett " sharply economically defined " characters . they're sharply defined all right , so sharply defined they all run together . pete finn , lew yard , max thaler noonan , chief police , could same character . beginning novel , continental op learns history conflict bill quint , i.w.w. organizer chicago , but that pretty much last we hear him . only interesting character whole book femme fatale , dinah brand , but her sole motivation seems money . hammett also problems resolution conflict . when painted into corner , he simply kills off character . even continental op pretty much cipher . he doesn't seem much background , other than he somewhat afraid old man , who runs continental detective agency . we know he smokes drinks too much even takes cocaine , but other than he doesn't live up his cool name . unfortunately all this reads like bad comic book . even hammett would good laugh what new york times said red harvest , i would assume 1929 when it published : " red harvest more than superb crime novel : it classic exploration corruption violence american grain . " i'll give him two stars noir dialogue , but rest it pretty much dreck .	-1

luigi pirandello 1921 play " six characters search author " ( " sei personaggi cerca d'autore " ) deserved reputation first existentialist drama profound effect later playwrights , especially those practitioners theater absurd such samuel beckett ( " waiting godot " ) , eugene ionesco ( " rhinoceros " ) , jean genet ( " maids " ) . pirandello writing often focuses elements madness , illusion isolation , all which inspired tragic aspects his personal life which his wife went insane his daugther tried commit suicide . 1921 during five week period pirandello wrote his two acknowledged masterpieces , " six characters search author " " henry iv . " while " six characters " successful when it opened rome it also considered scandalous . however , it soon performed milan , london , new york , germany . because his great influence modern theater , pirandello awareded noble prize literature 1934 . two years later , while negotiations appear film version " six characters , " he died . setting " six characters search author " rehearsal play ( pirandello ) interrupted arrival six characters . their leader , father , tells manager they looking author . it seems author who created them never finished their story they unrealized characters who not yet fully brought life . father insists they not real people but characters , manager his cast only laugh idea . but then they become intrigued bits pieces story six characters tell . father intellectual who married mother , peasant woman . however , she fell love his male secretary father , bored his wife , encouraged her leave . she , leaving behind eldest son who embittered abandonment . mother three children this other man but then father starts miss her watches other children grow up . this new family moves away , but after other man dies mother her children return city . mother gets job madame pace dress shop , but it turns out brothel where step-daughter ends up employed . one day father shows up set up step-daughter . however , mother stops them reaching obvious conclusion entire family moves father resentful son . manager agrees produce their story become author whom they searching . he tries stage scene where father meets step-daughter dress shop but both characters insist what actors doing not realistic . manager allows them finish out scene instead . this sets up basic juxtaposition " drama " " reality " rest play , key scenes lives these characters providing more questions than they answer what happened what it means . point when manager no longer tell difference acting reality he becomes fed up entire thing ends rehearsal , providing audience already challenged these changing notions reality abrupt ending drama . almost all characters play known their roles rather than their names , such leading man second female lead . one few characters drama who name madame pace , who charge dress shop also serves brothel where step-daughter works . it perhaps this formality serves distance us production more than strangeness action or aged words , even though they adapted modern ear . there may or may not real story here , but ultimate point this play tradition reality theater no longer holds true . radical idea here there immutability reality these six characters . because they forms , forced into performing actions which they imagined , there inherent conflict life . this why son wants escape but cannot leave studio must play his role , must mother rest characters . this just true all other characters besides six , although others less inclined see truth , or least reality , their own situation until end , when final scene drama seeks dissolve " stage " reality completely . where pirandello succeeds end it both ways , we interpret what we seen reality or acting . either way , you left same conclusion .	1

bringing their only child into world , making lifetime commitment each other , changed everything chris sue rouse when they faced her unplanned pregnancy . chris 18 years old , still high school , when chris jr. - known throughout his life " chrissy " - arrived . sue gave up her dreams college , career , world travel so young couple could build business family instead . eventually they succeeded so well financially chris could afford such hobbies owning his own small airplane . then he discovered scuba diving , sport which he promptly introduced both sue chrissy ; rouse family lives changed again . never inclined toward doing anything halves , they soon moved recreational diving - relatively safe pursuit - adrenaline rush cave diving . rouses earned respect remarkably short time among their fellow cave divers , they made hundreds dives thoroughly mastered incredibly dangerous sport . next chris chrissy turned their attention open ocean wreck diving , which they applied their cave diving knowledge . into this new least equally perilous ( possibly more so ) universe , sue followed her men less eagerly . chris chrissy found kindred spirit bernie chowdhury , fellow cave diver also intrigued transferring sport principles diving inside shipwrecks . when chowdhury survived agonizing , temporarily crippling potentially fatal case bends , after pushing his body his skills too far during wreck dive forced choose drowning surfacing without hours life-saving decompression , rouses listened his story hoped learn it . yet they found themselves facing same decision during dive wreck mysterious german u-boat nicknamed u-who , after business reverses forced them cut corners supporting their expensive hobby . it alone , trying get compressed air dive so deep rouses would safer breathing more expensive " trimix " avoid nitrogen narcosis ? or there other factors , less obvious ones , leading up father son team fatal last dive ? author chowdhury book only partly loving memorial his two friends ' memory . it also analysis what motivates , often obsesses , not just cave wreck divers ; but everyone who pursues extreme sports require constant ( often escalating ) risk one life . his fascination rooted his own terrifyingly close brush not only death , but permanent physical disability . he not only interested why divers , mountain climbers , etc . pursue such sports ; he also wants understand why such men women rarely deterred hearing , or even witnessing , others ' fatal or crippling mishaps . while i notice some other reviewers not pleased chowdury personal narratives included this book , i found those narratives completely necessary achieving author purpose . i thought same details rouse family life , which illuminated chris chrissy behavior they made series decisions what turned out their final morning alive . no , this isn't shadow divers . if you've read both books , you must noticed puzzled - i - total disconnect john chatterton behavior during coast guard evacuation rouses dive boat seeker , chowdury described it here it described ( entirely different terms ) shadow divers . chowdury isn't accomplished author whom writing career . he simply man important story tell , who my opinion fine job doing exactly . nothing more ; but nothing less , either .	-1

i agree . seifert review . this book might thought provoking , eye opening , or supposedly mind-blowing some teenager who never considered technology might not meaning life , but any adult who already thought way beyond coupland very obvious comments modern society , book nothing new or interesting say wasn't all entertaining way . middle book , i actually enjoying plot wanted read more see how things turned out self-obsessed whiners ( " oh , i'm so lonely .

peter singer long since proven himself one most important influential ethical utilitarian philosophers 20th century . however , when singer steps into realm politics things get little murky ; this book , " one world " analysis globalization its effects , it less than perfect work . instance , singer provides thorough background information harmful effects industry environment form greenhouse gas emissions , then moves into section politics international law . now problem his research majority sources he cites footnotes outdated web pages no longer accessed , hardly something you want ground your beliefs globalization . exception this source footnote 33 page 45 " one atmosphere " chapter , which links excellent website detailing u . . ' steadily increasing rate carbon dioxide emissions which confirm his claims . unfortunately , number these online resources singer cites cannot reached , i'm referring now footnotes 5 6 chapter 1 which details u.n. reports , footnotes 2 4 chapter 2 also not available , footnotes 10 , 11 , 20 , 35 , 37 , 59 chapter 3 , " one economy , " these just sampling sources i checked . majority this highly unreliable data , it not just websites , singer relies very heavily thomas friedman biased book " lexus olive tree , " see footnotes 15 , 16 , 17 chapter 1 . clearly there dilemma people who serious this topic after reading through singer notes . hell , maybe every single source cited this book correct , but i couldn't verify great deal it . but that just one complaint i book ; addition , singer indicates me he just isn't expert politics any sense word . instance , when discussing international law humanitarian intervention initiatives , singer simply confuses political " authority " political " legitimacy " outright . not only , but he proceeds discuss genocide crimes against humanity regard democratic political systems without offering any kind working definition democracy . i wonder if he realizes so-called democracy u.s. contributed genocide east timor . anyway , i've said before singer excellent ethical philosopher , but his politics pretty amateurish . perhaps my biggest complaint book singer failure analyze connection rise globalization rise poverty , pollution , war , etc . he simply describes globalization phenomenon , detailing facets wto so , without offering much thoughtful connection phenomenon other ethical concerns book . put it simply , singer ultimately cops out offering normative judgment globalization whole , preferring instead move other issues like international law nationalism , issues me least intimately related globalization . book some good insights offer ; final section where singer analyzes u . . ' frugal contributions third world countries particularly striking , he offers some insightful solutions solving problems global poverty suffering . additionally , he offers some interesting criticisms john rawls ' work political justice his failure address issues justice differing societies . yet , i'm afraid this book too many problems recommend or rely , but i'm sure there many superior books globalization readers who willing look .	-1

when i bought this book , intially i open mind toilet training methods , but after reading this book i am sceptical child centred technique . reasons outlined book circular logic which makes no sense me . also , some suggestions seemed just silly me - instance , advice change active baby dirty nappy bath while she pulls herself up down ! dr brazelton outlines reasons changing child centred technique 60 - prevent high occurrence failure rigid early training schedules which involved punishment shame . much more rigorous study than one which dr brazelton describes would looked age training use punishment independently , then drawn conclusions what causing high failure rate . study conducted it impossible conclude which two factors - early age or punishment- more harmful . dr brazelton gives list signs readiness then assumes no child these signs before age 2 . i feel this greatly underestimating our children , also patronising other cultures around world ( who don't live " our mainstream hygienic culture " ) who train their children much younger age . i feel this book could very confusing parents they endlessly wait their child exhibit all signs readiness none signs not ready . but some signs child not ready could due waiting too long ; example , 1 . child sits toilet then pees soon after standing up : this could also due child made longstanding habit peeing standing up which possible diaper ; 2 . child not uncomfortable dirty diaper : this could also because child diapers so long , he conditioned accept walking around faeces smeared his bottom ! dr brazelton strongly emphasizes toilet training should up child it his achievement . course ! no one else control his muscles ! why then this only possible after certain age ? book , he desribes how he pre-empts toilet training questions 12 18 month checkups strongly advises parents not start until after age 2 . this me smacks interference well beyond what appropriate patient doctor . no wonder parents confused - they told ignore knowledge their own child . final note , i'm bit tired hackneyed advice " don't worry , your child won't diapers college " seems so prevalent toilet training experts . more point , " your child still diapers when he goes school ? " , which seems like possibility if you endlessly wait all signs readiness . perhaps then your child could attend dr brazelton toilet school untrained 4-6 year olds .	-1

several reviewers submitted highest life aristotle proposes consists " hard work " or " most difficult life . " i am afraid this language not accurately present aristotle description . aristotle writes these lecture notes contemplative life " superior human level " ( 1177b27 ) . yet , he distinguishes it secondary lives saying these secondary lives " require trouble " ( 1177b18 ) . aristotle calls contemplative life most pleasant life ( 1177a25ff ) . certainly , study hard work ; but this not hard work sense toil . work towards truth contemplate it once attained requires little strain . it virtuous agent right action any given circumstance : ease . through influence kant ( possibly stoics ) , we often associate virtue denying passions overcoming greatest obstacles ; likewise , we associate vice passions overcoming reason . this sense , most virtuous person would no passions all . however , aristotle suggests passions only conflict reason lower moral character . when reason prevails one right action against passion urges , he calls this ' enkrasia ' ; when passions overcome , he calls this ' akrasia ' . however , internal discord present these characters not present virtuous ( vicious ) . virtuous character most reliable participates definition virtue itself because agent habituated passions follow reason . his or her passions actually encourage agent what right . ( note : vicious agent , through doing base actions , no longer recognizes them such , so reason passion coincide doing what wrong ) . applying these distinctions contemplative life , we see this activity not work all sense toil . activity requires effort sure ; but , this effort most enjoyable agent . it engages what highest human person when it carried out through ( morally intellectually ) virtuous character , this activity turns out most pleasurable . so while pleasure not human good not measure happiness , it wrong think good life not pleasant eudaimon . it only stuggle those still way achieving it	1

orville schell works always exquisite . written crisp style , penetrating analysis , his books never failed breathe life into their subjects leave reader more informed than before . expecting same tour de force found mandate heaven discos democracy , i not disappointed virtual tibet : searching shangri-la himalayas hollywood . schell tackles topic receives plenty discussion fanfare , but experienced precious little objective study recent years . tibet labored under political cultural repression people republic china since 1951 . many believe china slowly committing cultural genocide through its repression tibetan religious cultural customs encouraging vast numbers han chinese settle tibet . help charismatic dalai lama throngs hollywood stars , tibetan issue received disproportionate amount attention relative its importance world events . whereas one struggles find quot ; free east timorquot ; bumper stickers cars , quot ; free tibetquot ; stickers far more ubiquitous . strong point schell work his analysis hollywood fascination tibet . he interviews many most visible promoters tibetan cause also provides fly-on- the-wall accounts numerous quot ; free tibetquot ; hollywood functions making movies kundun seven years tibet . through his interviews observations , schell largely confirms what i suspected years . hollywood promotion tibetan cause less its relative merits than it fact it become fashionable issue which associated . tibetan cause become virtual rohrsach test which hollywood supporters use feel better what ails them spiritually politically . schell works demonstrate uncanny ability meeting all right people convincing them reveal their true feelings . instead communist party officials or chinese gangsters his previous works , schell somehow able elicit revealing quotes otherwise elusive individuals such steven seagal brad pitt . although nobody complained misquoted my knowledge , i hope this reflects schell skill interviewer . it would shame if writer journalist schell quality needed embellish his subject words better copy . schell succeeds making subject tibetan history more entertaining general reader without sacrificing content . schell virtual tibet informative well-rounded work , lifting much mystique esoteric , yet prominent subject . while schell sympathizes their cause , he able remove veil motivation hollywood tibetan supporters . many readers may expected schell delve deeper into issues surrounding china tibet , but this would required schell tread over already well- traveled terrain . deciding leave debate over relative merits chinese policies toward tibet aside , schell produced original thoughtful work journalism . schell portrayal main protagonists tibetan cause unflattering bound upset many people . this hallmark fine journalist	-1

" star wars : empire strikes back , " written donald . glut , recounts epic tale 1980 " star wars : episode v-the empire strikes back , " sequel " star wars : new hope . " i found some things different movie rather interesting , first which yoda color blue instead pale green , second he gnaws his gimer stick , unseen me movie . this added story me terms who he how he acted . other things , though , seemed take away story . there wasn't great deal detail . this true previous novel , but this time fact everything little vague didn't always help fuel imagination . i liked author often used word " sword " instead " lightsaber , " but he never told reader color luke sword vader sword ( or if they both colorless ); i already knew colors just because i seen movie , but book seemed written someone who already seen movie ( fact very little americans not seen movie beside point ) when it supposed written anyone his target audience . he one point said battle taking place going back-and-forth red green laser blasts , but who green who red ? leaving some things imagination ( like how people look , their facial expressions ) okay , but if author going describe how something looks , he should finish job , not leave it halfway . this would still yet okay certain authors ' styles , but this author style doesn't seem tell it righ t.t here certain moments book should given more weight . they certainly depth , i could still vividly imagine what happening how it happening such rich atmosphere , but everything seems weighed evenly . when luke finds out yoda jedi master whom he searching , it just happens . author comes point where luke makes discovery then author just moves . book never sits down reader thinks , feels , wonderful moments . moment movie , well soundtrack , given great weight , but this book just tells tale too quickly without delight . same true when luke discovers darth vader his father . it just happens . author then , omniscient third-person view , describes luke thoughts , yet somehow author dries everything up reader . author gives fair weight what happening-yoda standing corner luke discovers jedi master ; luke fighting vader cloud city-when weight should given words they speak . book spendid just any moment yoda luke . luke well described too much pride his successes , yoda character comes alive . he described exactly how he should , which say he seems goofy first , yet you discover it not goofiness ; it yoda incredible jedi teacher . he may not even great teacher author describes it , but it described such delight . magic tree particularly enchanting ; luke goes off search cave because he feels dark side , he finds darth vader , or just mystical trick . i actually liked it better here book than movie . luke bewildered , chapter ends yoda gnawing his gimer stick . way author presents it so mystical , so enchanting , my eyes wide open even though i reading it very late night ( morning ) . chapter ended , i fell back my seat just wondering what happened me . i laughed . i really laughed this time . watching " star wars " movies over over again seems make it all dry sand me unless i consciously make sure i enjoy it , but reading this book really made me laugh ; han solo leia organa really some verbally delightful moments showing their affection or lack thereof ; this book got much wit movie . i'm sure i remember laughing whenever yoda nonchalanty went gnawing his gimer stick while luke struggled complete his daunting , seemingly impossible jedi training tasks . this book really makes characters spring life . " star wars : empire strikes back " tells epic tale told book format , highly recommended all " star wars " fans ; it little more classic science-fictionndash ; oriented , so i would recommend it any sci-fi reader well . some parts fans hold such high esteem movies told without any delight or without any weight , but depth still there , other scenes certainly delightful enough worth read . overall , it good book , emotional , powerful , enchanting ; everything here	-1

one reviewer stated , reviewer who criticized this book basis his antagonism religious faith missed point . i would go further state he showed weakness his own thinking process . true science religious faith neutral . conduct good scientific experiements , question god left out process . this no means implies scientist not hold personal opinion subject , either or against . it merely means he or she suspends personal belief interest conducting good experiments . further , number people who hold certain position regarding faith , neither makes faith valid nor makes it invalid . professor personal faith atheism . religious faith , every bit much theism , creationism , or any other many isms this world . this very adequately demonstrated his intollerant review . he takes extreme position opposite side radical creationists , but no more defensible then radical creationists ' views . he even goes so far suggest scientists ( some whom nobel prize winners ) who seem think belief god not unreasonable , not intelligent . now book itself . i find it very fascinating look process how many world great scientific minds approach questions addressed this book . people questioned take positions across spectrum belief/disbelief . book includes number answers those who not believe god . i found process approach very well , ask reasonable questions . this book i think worth reading no matter whether you believe god or don't . thinking process never hurt hearing opinions differ your own	1

i always admired architecture . i love wandering through cities , marvelling their skyscrapers , travelling europe see older buildings . i bought " world history architecture " so i could better understand not only beauty these buildings , but their place architectural history . " world history " exceeded my expectations . its sixteen chapters describe characteristics innovations architecture major movements . you learn what makes gothic architecture gothic , romanesque romanesque . " world history " also explains how these styles developed eachother . although appearance might suggest otherwise , today skyscrapers descendants parthenon pantheon . not all chapters describe western styles , however . there long , interesting sections egyptian , indian , chinese , islamic pre-columbian american architecture . authors explain how these types influenced western architecture , something i never realized . it fascinating read islamic mosques source many concepts found medieval cathedrals , mayan buildings inspired some frank lloyd wright work . book well written full beautiful pictures illustrate ideas described text . i don't think there single page devoid pictures , which alone make book interesting leaf through . my only complaints concern hefty price bulky size . this more textbook than bedroom reading . i found it uncomfortable lay down couch read this , or even sit armchair . it best read sitting desk , like your chemistry textbook high school . otherwise , " world history " perfect . read this , i feel like i completed architectural class . this book gave me knowledge architectural history i cant wait use my next vacation	1

when this book came out last year , i remember it uniformly dismissed garbage - mostly result accusations embedded within this tome pages regarding rafael palmeiro steroid user . well , quite bit changed since book release - congressional hearing , raffy testing positive steroids , continued growth barry bonds ' noggin . , amazingly , amid all hue cry over steroid usage baseball over past year , this reviewer finds jose canseco sanest voice debate over steroids . juiced not simply canseco love letter steroids . he uniformly unapologetic his steroid use - which slightly disturbing , yes - but his candor over fact he would merely average baseball player it not his steroid usage actually very impressive . i tired vainglorious ballplayer retrospective loooooong ago - middle school , point fact - yet , i thoroughly impressed canseco account here because there unusual amount self-awareness one would not expect any ballplayer . plus , it actually highly readable - i stop short saying " well-written " because keats this obviously not , but surprisingly engaging clearly written . while this book revelation sorts one makes likes messrs . mcgwire , sosa , palmeiro , bonds look like utter cowards not more forthright baseball-following public over their accomplishments , i still urge degree caution reading this book , particularly little-league set . this sort book i would , impressionable little leaguer , wanted desperately read . mr. canseco little too enthusiastic benefits steroids - such way one whose sense skepticism not yet fully developed could read it advertisement proverbial " b-12 " shots . also , it seems bit self-serving places regard his spousal abuse rap , somewhat unfairly takes cal ripken , jr. without any substantive reasons why . notwithstanding these criticisms , anyone whose innocence vis-a-vis baseball long since shattered , i actually highly recommend this book . how strange it canseco may ultimately come out steroid era player most unscathed - if so , it largely strength " juiced " . not literary masterpiece , but definitely among strongest baseball genre	-1
i bought this book few years ago recommendation professor labor history . history often told point view " winners " , so i thought it would good absorb perspective not usually taught . i admit all history form narrative , there no " pure " facts history since all narratives make value judgments least implicitly . but some narratives " work " better than others ; some narratives enshrine values would better us hold than others . some ways understanding past more helpful , thus more correct , than others . narrative presented this book not very helpful same reason ruling-class narratives unhelpful : both heroic narratives . only difference those who play role hero those who play marginalized switched places . history far too complex process - story - say " so-and-so responsible such-and-such " . this case , we learn poor laborers , minorities , women , immigrants " really " responsible america accomplishments . course , this partially correct , it surely case we would not where we it not these groups . but imply educated white men - people like two authors book themselves - made little " real " contribution america accomplishments but instead responsible all our social failings preposterous . this simply swing pendulum opposite extreme . fact , i think whole project parcelling out persons into groups , then telling group-based historical narrative problematic . which group defines your identity ? failing this book it mistakes part whole , necessary sufficient . much better narrative includes marginalized working class found howard zinn * people history united states * . i gave book two stars instead one because writing quite good - just like absorbing historical fiction	-1
this huge , comprehensive biography robert moses , same time examination flaws early mid twentieth century urban planning . it told considerable gusto ( times perhaps too much caro passions tend run high exposed through his prose , thus losing its dispassionate nature ) . although subject matter might not first sight stir blood those not interested urban planning or who not live new york , it really fascinating read . that because it works two levels : firstly tragedy traditional sense term hero ( moses ) carried high then destroyed his own character ; but importantly caro draws lessons learned unbalanced transport policies - over-reliance cars expense other means transportation . lessons there learned - merely building more roads serves increase traffic rather than ease congestion . lack sound relocation policy where people moved due public works creates new slums destroys established communities . it unfortunate these lessons still learned , or yet learned both developing world ( try crossing road bangkok ! ) even west ( how badly london needs better public transport ) . caro book long , but style makes his later multi-volume biography lyndon johnson so enjoyable already there : finishing work , you won't indifferent robert moses , nor what his manner urban development meant continues mean . rodgers	1

one hardest things anyone learn , no matter where you life , or how much money you , coping times when things don't turn out you expect . some people never recover , while others seem sail past disaster hardly break stride . trick isn't what disaster , but how they've handled it . longtime author harold . kushner , best known his when bad things happen good people , takes intriguing look ability cope using figure moses bible . yes , moses . out all various people torah , he undoubtably most complex . most us tend visualize him certain actor hollywood , brawny , noble imposing , able smite down miscreants when single blow , but those who studied moses bible find someone bit more closer earth . if anyone deal disappointment , it certainly moses . called upon lead captive jews out egypt , facing down most powerful ruler earth , it seems once he got them out wilderness sinai , things ought improving . instead , what happening when he returns first set tablets ? why , they're worshipping idol shape golden calf . it doesn't even stop there -- throughout forty years exile , people complain thirst , hunger , -- enough make anyone throw up their hands disgust walk away . perhaps most bitter all , moses denied entry into promised land , only allowed glimpse goal he worked so hard he dying . you admit , that quite disappointment . but not once during all these setbacks , moses tell god he gives up . he might protest he might not able handle burden , but he try complete it . it this message rabbi kushner uses best effect this book , giving positive use times when disappointment enters our lives , not give up . society where it seems perfection demanded , failure viewed moral failing rather than something occurs every person life , getting view across disappointment means building character rather than sign you're not going amount much . it not very long book , easily read within few hours time , but contents informative meaningful . rabbi kushner writing style very fluid readable , keeping technical jargon , while he go off tangents regularly , he never forgets what he talking . only problem i tangents occured quite bit , occansionally annoying . still , despite flaws , it good book , earned four stars i gave it overall . more importantly , it gives positive human message reassuring needed our rather complicated , perfectionist society , one sorely needed .	-1

there very few memoirs published record producers , especially producers important george martin , producer ? discovererquot ; beatles . i call it memoir because that what it - much more covered than beatles . this book george martin , through through . first 100 pages or so recount martin early history british military up through his first job recording industry . there staggering detail this , naming even most insignificant people he met way . but since we know this all contributing what would become martin genius , it really isn't all tedious . eventually we come chapter beatles - how he discovered them , how he recorded them , then single singe , how they became biggest band world . whether he intends it or not , there epic quality practically every word martin writes ( or rather , ghostwritten him ) . professional today music industry seeing literally all music recorded computers , it fascinating see technology they working . he writes actually recording * wax records * . it also nice see someone getting so excited advent stereo recording . it something we don't even think today , but producers martin era , recording stereo profound recording hard drives today . i also amazed learn he made almost no money off beatles records . today , comparable producer - say glenn ballard , alanis ' former producer - probably made dozens millions dollars . martin didn't earn any royalties those records , he also refused ownership stake publishing company set up exclusively beatles songs . this probably cost him upwards $ 50,000,000 if not more . he goes say he no regrets refusing ownership , whether or not you believe him , he lay out pretty impressive spiel not doing it money . i arrived conclusion , however , while genius producer he possibly world worst businessman . hundreds people made millions off beatles one closest them - martin - managed make almost nothing . truly staggering . this kind book that must-have beatles fan or aspiring musician , proselytize everyone else . classic book classic producer .	1

" four blind mice " action packed , entertaining , doesn't burden reader complications such thinking . there aren't complex social interactions , terribly dynamic characters , or social commentaries would get way simply enjoying fun adventure . english professors love hate these kinds books . they believe time reading would better spent only literature highest caliber . english professors , however , ones who took enjoyment out reading millions people , making them overanalyze learn hate fiction . therefore , it any surprise today reading literature all time lows , fewer fewer people picking up novels more more turning mindless programming television . personally i love read high literature . it enlightening , often challenges your values , or helps one understand differing points view . other hand , however , sometimes ( call it guilty pleasure ) i simply want read something i don't think much . it times like this i turn james patterson or john grishom novel . plot " four blind mice " wasn't very complex ; rather it unfolded mostly predictably . characters mostly flat , without much way development . i felt no better read this book . i wouldn't want it any other way	-1

throughout pat buchanan fascinating illustrious career , even his closest friends admirers detected certain reluctance his part engage issue race . his newest book , state emergency , mr. buchanan finally concedes accurate examination plight u.s. immigration futile without resort lens racial identity . book begins quoting arnold toynbee , giant among historians , " civilizations perish suicide , not murder . " within toynbee paradigm , civilizational suicide promoted any three " imminent , mortal perils " : dying populations , disintegrating cultures , unresisted invasions . ever historian , himself , mr. buchanan then illustrates history most dramatic precedent our dilemma , fall roman empire fifth century , not long after emperor valens granted asylum large band gothic refugees who appeared rome gates . within two years , these ingrates barbarians sacked city murdered valens , himself , eventually precipitating roman empire move istanbul , ushering dark ages . case anyone should miss analogy , author then draws parallel george bush , his favorable attitude toward third world immigration requisite amnesty . scope problemthe scope problem immense sobering , mr. buchanan not disappoint those who find statistics useful measure its gravity . example : * 36 million immigrants their offspring now living u.s. greater than all immigration u.s. 1607 1960 ; * approximately half eight million foreigners who entered u.s. 2000 2005 , so illegally ; * one 12 illegal immigrants criminal ; * 10% 20% all mexican , central american caribbean peoples now live u.s. ; * there may 20 million illegal immigrants currently residing here ; racial imperativeas informed americans already know , current wave third world immigration invading our shores differs markedly all earlier waves immigrants variety ways . today immigrants not products western , judeo-christian civilization , desiring assimilate adopt american " ethos " : rather , this new wave immigrants consist such alien backward peoples bantus somalia , ( who never heard indoor plumbing , ) mestizos central america , who apparently won't use latter even when available ! here buchanan breaks new ground his candid acknowledgement truism : " people create cultures : cultures don't create people . " other words cultures reflection talent creativity people : merely allowing alien individual access superior culture not imbue individual talents characteristics thrive this new environment , nor even appreciate i t.t here good reasons many aliens wish leave squalor they helped create back home , equally good reasons oppose their coming here , so prevent their doing u.s. which they've already their homelands . owing inexplicable " multiculturalist " zeal academia elite news media last 25 years or so , we permitted foreign nationals emigrate this country who less educated , less intelligent , less appreciative our cultural " ethos " than any wave immigrants before them . result , they far less capable assimilation , even if their numbers far fewer . solutionsin his final chapter , author proposes number intriguing solutions problem , which roughly categorized four ways : physical barriers ; electoral remedies ; economic disincentives ; legal reforms . combination , these designed avoid expense difficulty deportation , favor policy attrition . briefly , his proposal physical barrier deter invasion our southern border consists 2 fifteen foot-high fences erected immediately inside u.s. border , two-lane road them permit border patrol travel either direction . supplementing these , buchanan proposes motion sensors alert border patrol , second wall eight foot " coiled wire . " beyond this , he suggests deep ditches prevent further penetration border vehicles used smuggle drugs humans , should any successfully penetrate earlier obstacles . author claims these physical barriers could built $8 billion , amount easily offset inevitable savings welfare , medicaid , crime , disease , etc . terms electoral reform , buchanan suggests willingness take corrective action should essential pre-condition support any candidate running public office , support border fence should pre-condition support any presidential candidate . also , states should urged enact measures such california proposition 187 , arizona proposition 200 , both which written deny welfare illegal aliens . economic disincentives go beyond merely shutting off welfare spigot would require federal legislation , could consist heavy fines hiring illegals , well jail terms repeat offenders . likewise , i.r.s. could directed assess penalties interest tax obligations not withheld when illegals employed " off-the-books " paid cash . moreover , cities sanctuary policies might penalized reducing amount federal monies they receive , annually , universities favoring illegals lower , " in-state " tuition could penalized same manner . author suggested legal reforms consist ending so-called " chain-migration , " whereby legal immigrant apply his entire extended nuclear family brought here once he becomes citizen . buchanan also advocates we end dual citizenship : if someone votes foreign election , they committed crime : if they serve foreign government or military , they should presumed renounced u.s. citizenship . author also recommends we enact federal laws over-ride local sanctuary laws , end phenomenon " anchor-babies , " whereby child born u.s. automatically citizen , even if his parents here illegally . deporting felons , gang members , drunk drivers additional suggestions . illegals should also ineligible receive social security or " earned income tax credit . " he suggests u.s. deny visa applications and/or foreign aid governments ( such mexico ) might refuse cooperate such reforms . meantime , buchanan recommends we impose immigration moratorium , allowing time national debate what kinds new immigrants we should allow into u.s. ( who knows ? : even republicans might eschew lip service " multiculturalism " if they saw large majority electorate demanded immigrants white , skilled , employable , christian ! ) conclusionmr . buchanan considers immigration " existential crisis our civilization . " vintage buchanan , he sums up problem illegal immigration manner upon which it would difficult improve : " ... they not americans they not belong our home . if we not stop this invasion start repatriating them lands whence they came , we lose our country , we unworthy our fathers who gave this country us - unworthy our children , we , through our softness , squandered their priceless patrimony .

kathy watson argues ably nimbly we should not regard mary lamb madness occasional thing visited her left no traces , leaving essential mary lamb behind . no , it part parcel her personality , seen her writing well . watson discovers outside famous tales shakespeare which she wrote her brother charles ( splitting down corpus shakespeare ignoring histories , writing up comedies , leaving tragedies charles ) , mary lamb wrote other books well , which she makes sound perfectly fascinating . i would love read " mrs. leicester " book hope tarcher , which published this fine biography , print companion book mary lamb collected writing . she hints also mary drawn many men , including romantic poet samuel taylor coleridge , who so sexy she just couldn't help herself when he around . charles eventually ask coleridge not come around because visit him would find mary going little crazy . watson brings us into early 19th century world madhouse , which pretty creepy place . women private means like mary lamb their own rooms own attendants , but still they must seen some dreadful sights , making their lives very different other women their class who general protected seamy . you never forget however , mary killed her own mother knife , crime so rare people hardly ever run into it , even judges long histories criminal cases , even hardened homicide cops . why she it ? watson provides limited answer . my mind mary lamb psychology similar lizzie borden , except she perhaps more lovable more humorous nature . but both brooders both nurtured unassimilable hatred toward patriarchal structure family	1

" romeo , romeo ! where art thou romeo ? " wait minute , wrong play ! my opinion , much ado nothing very funny book/play i somewhat enjoyed reading it . only bad part it it chick flick ( or its case chick play ) . old english also took away play sometimes . however , most part it understandable . overall , i believe shakespeare probably reason writing play other than just pure entertainment . much ado nothing classic shakespearian type play . it comedy two young couples . one couple benedick beatrice . start play they love one , they just not know it yet . they constantly bickering fighting each other . other couple hero claudio , who madly love each other ( or so they think ) plot make benedick beatrice realize they love each other . they also help form leanato , don pedro , margaret ursula . meanwhile , don pedro evil brother don john his henchmen , conrade borachio , plot break up hero claudio . plan nearly succeeds , rather unusual constable dogberry his somewhat merry men must come rescue claudio hero relationship . i said before , main point shakespeare writing play probably more than entertainment . i believe he also wrote it because he wanted show how crazy love make person . play , beatrice benedick fall love each other . after claudio shames hero , beatrice so upset she asks benedick kills claudio . now presents problem because benedick claudio good friends . first , benedick very reluctant this . so reluctant he refuses this . after she says she not love him any more benedick immediately agrees kill claudio . even though i would probably same thing benedick position , it still amazing what love make you . surprisingly , i actually learned something this play . it simple fact assumptions very , very dangerous . thanks don john his henchmen evil plot , claudio thought he seen hero cheating him borachio . reality , it margaret borachio he saw . acting only what he saw , he shamed hero " killed " her . end , it happily ever after moment . personally , i expected better ending , but that just me . yes , i would recommend this book but i myself not love it . too much love , not enough action drama . however , it very funny , especially constable dogberry ( my favorite character book/play ) . also plot well developed so kept my interest . overall , it good worth reading . i would give book/play 8.11 out 10 . you would probably like it so go buy read it . great play , but it just not me .	-1

this very ambitious book , it covers very diverse set topics gravity . one good things this book it covers lot material isn't usually covered books general relativity or string theory , especially this level detail . it certainly not introduction general relativity or string theory . i would recommend readers unfamiliar these topics study wald polchinski firs t.t he book opens chapters covering differential geometry nother theorem . intent isn't teach readers these topics , but rather establish notation provide high level review . when gravitation introduced it not usual geometrical approach , but it approached theory massless spin two particles , feynman lectures gravitation . it interesting approach showing starting linear theory non-linear terms must included consistency this leads general relativity which leads geometric interpretation gravity . it also includes nice discussion gravitational energy momentum psuedotensor . more detailed consideration non-localizability gravitational energy give throughout book . following this gravitational action covered fair amount detail . addition more common approach considering metric only independent variable theory , he also covers approach where metric connection independent variables . although it less common see palatini formalism it hardly uncommon . it also foundation approach non-string theory approach quantum gravity , i.e. loop quantum gravity . i enjoyed discussion torsion general relativity , this covered more detail than one usually sees . up until this point book covered classical gravity , however approach isn't standard one . approach general relativity one useful understanding material quantum gravity . none this material particularly obscure ( exception teleparallelism ) , but i think it fairly unusual see it all covered one place so much depth . next , author extends poincare algebra including fermionic generators give supergravity . he restricts his coverage only = 1 = 2 supersymmetry . this followed more extensive coverage energy general relativity , mainly focusing non-localizability gravitational energy energy conditions . next few chapters deal various solutions general relativity . first couple , schwarzschild reissner-nordstrom solutions , covered most ( former essentially all ) books general relativity . however , coverage here goes way beyond normal . after quickly getting schwarzschild solution its thermodynamics higher dimensional analogs covered . reissner-nordstrom case there even greater amount material beyond normal . this included : proca lagrangian , majumdar-papapetrou family solutions , static solutions multiple extremal black holes , gravitational solitons , more discussion localizability gravitational energy , thermodynamics , electromagnetic duality ( including extension he relates , u dualities string theory ) , monopoles , chern-simons terms higher dimensional solutions . over next couple chapters more solutions described , some fair amount depth : taub-nut , taub-bolt , bps states , instantons , plane fronted gravity waves , kaluza-klien black holes , bogomol'nyi bound , dehn twits dilaton black holes . it nice seeing all this covered one place ; however , times it reads catalog i wasn't really sure what main point . after chapter supersymmetry book moves study string theory . this comprises final third book . introductory string material presented lightening rate . i would guess most readers exposed string theory first time would overwhelmed . naturally branes also covered . emphasis most this part duality symmetries string theory how they relate various solutions . string part book finishes off describing black hole solutions string theory . one interesting inconsistency book he describes schwarzschild solution gravitational field massive pointlike particle . what makes this interesting earlier book he went great lengths explain schwarzschild solution not gravitational field massive pointlike particle , easiest way see this singularity this spacelike so source can't massive particle . whole i liked this book lot , i thought it many strengths . i wouldn't choose it first book general relativity or string theory , but that not its intent anyway . approach developing gravity isn't usual one ( interestingly he uses + --- signature which fairly uncommon , these days , outside study spinors ) , but it good compliment it one students gravitation should aware . not only because it provides bridge study quantum gravity , but also because it interesting its own right . strength lot interesting , often neglected , topics developed much more detail than usually provided	-1

this lavishly photo-illustrated smoothly-written book details all psilocybin-containing mushrooms generally known up date publication , including those outside species psilocybe some extremely rare ones known only single location or single event ( sometimes mysterious magic mushrooms crop up after storms but never seen again unless spores taken them grown under controlled conditions ) . stamets explains often-conflicting taxonomy psilocybe mushrooms ( one species , example , received two different names because two writing teams who travelled together wrote it up separately -- one published first * their * name " priority , " even though some people use name given other team ; despite name difference mushroom described same species ) . stamets no prude . he writes quite bluntly psilocybin-containing mushrooms ( including his own tripping them ) , he extremely ( justly ) critical other mycologists who not only refuse describe such mushrooms , but , one case stamets cites , said it better people die eating poisonous mushrooms than people able safely identify psilocybin-containing mushrooms ! stamets gives descriptions photos poisonous look-alike mushrooms gives step-by-step identification procedure psilocybin ' shrooms . most cases identification straightforward within few minutes ; other cases look-alikes lethal suspect mushrooms carefully gone over avoid poisoning . one extemely curious phenomenon which stamets describes cases which people " tripped " mushrooms which generally considered non-poisonous which species which not supposed contain * any * psychoactive chemicals ; stamets speculates if these cases genuine , they may represent instances which biochemistry one individual reacted completely unpredictable near-unique way " normal " mushroom . ( i heard some people whose bodies * naturally * manufacture ethanol ordinary sugars food sufficient quantites become drunk without ever consumed liquid alcohol ; these freak instances people tripping non-pyshoactive mushrooms may represent something similar -- rare individuals whose bodies convert innocuous chemicals into psychoactive ones ; since reported cases people who didn't intend eat magic mushroom first place , who probably sworn off mushroom eating forever result their experience , likelihood repeat occurence given individual probably close zero . still , fact such unexpected event occurred all underscores couple points which stamets makes again again : don't eat any wild mushroom which you not positively identified , don't gorge yourself species which you * * identified until you taken small sample see how your own body reacts them . ) one interesting feature book estimate relative potency psilocybin-containing mushrooms explanation why some cultivated mushrooms differ widely potency even though they belong same species . some members species psilocybe actually don't contain any psilocybin all , but apparently all members species either taste bad or too chewy used food , even non-psychoactive ones . only weakness book it not contain section describing numerous cultivated varieties . cubensis , which vary greatly appearance growing requirements ( , according vendors , least ) potency . many these varieties doubtless " gone wild " ( stamets says grounds universities outside courthouses two best places hunt " wild " psilocybin mushrooms ! ) , but there only one listing species photos what presumably wild varities not derived artificial selection growers . stamets true fan mushrooms his commercial website ( he doesn't sell psilocybin mushrooms , way ) gives examples how mushrooms used bioremediation polluted lands used improve yields crops . stamets points out one best places look wild muchrooms land which just hit storm or where humans just ravaged it put up or tear down building . although stamets not gone far off deep end terrence mckenna his brother ( writing under their own names or " ott osric " ) , it apparent he , like many other partakers magic mushrooms , believes them vital part gaia their spread humans part planetary evolution . simple example , those hunting " magic " mushrooms ( whether deliberately or not ) carry magic mushroom spores back where they found , but they also carry spores other species which grow nearby , their turn , vital ecological components even if they aren't psychoactive : just growing * near * psychoactive mushroom gives other mushrooms evolutionary advantage their spores dispersed primates anxious go tripping but whose hair or fur or clothes brush against other species mushroom carry their spores location . it becomes easy see why some people believe psychoactive mushrooms ( especially psilocybe species ) co-evolved humans means enhance biosphere gaia . i give this book five well-deserved stars . i know know other book which contains so much information magic mushroom history mycology provides such clear-cut easy follow steps identifying psilocybin-containg species . if nothing else it beautiful look . ****	1

after reading first three volumes merchant princes i half willing completely write charles stross off . this fantasy series less than impressive while it decent ideas parallel worlds secret families potential really strong series . but merchant princes overall disappointing read . charles stross , other hand , lauded most awards writer sff awarded he picks up nominations almost before he finishes writing work fiction . so maybe it just me . maybe i missing something . stross known more his science fiction than his fantasy , so perhaps if i gave his science fiction shot i would find something would live up hype . i started beginning atrocity archives . atrocity archive short novel which his first published novel archives also includes novella concrete jungle . concrete jungle hugo winner 2005 best novella . i only describe small portion what novel because there just somethings i am unable explain properly . let me say novel set early 2001 there man named bob howard who works laundry london . laundry secret organization which place battle forces darkness . imagine world where nazis attempted tap into netherworld bring all sorts evil support third reich all this possible just science fact . stross gives level detail unreal impossible feels almost prosaic . it remarkable talent . bob howard ( robert . howard reference , anyone ? ) computer guy but wants put field spy type jobs his involvement without sufficient training gets him involved events build beyond what he ever would imagined . bob howard gets involved into this very netherworld evil laundry trying desperately stop . what makes atrocity archives quite bit different than other sff novels this combination lovecraft , len deighton spy novels perhaps little bit neal stephenson . i think charles stross far stronger non-merchant princes work because while atrocity archives read like slow moving spy novel it kept building building became more more interesting exciting find out what happening next . atrocity archives worth time spent reading it . -joe sherr	-1

i confess i didn't get very far this one . if you read this course , i'm very sorry . i'm not academic , but i i read lot philosophy . i'll put lot energy into complex text , but i prefer invest it works enlighten , not confuse . clarity-precision scale , i would push levinas right past " dense " or " challenging " put it somewhere " turgid " " impenetrable . " ( his apologists decry inability human language convey levinas ' sophisticated thoughts . maybe so , but perhaps apology says more his thoughts than it human language . ) any case , it take you long time genuinely read this book . if you're looking truth ( opposed passing grade required course ) , you would better served spending 3 hours contemplating reasoning your own working definition following words : --- " totality " --- " infinity " --- " other " then spend 3 hours contemplating reasoning your own understanding how three interrelated . then get decent translation aristotle metaphysics .

" this sentence could easily begun book , it effectively introduces what wolin set out : present intellectual historical roots heidegger " children " ( hannah arendt , karl lowith , hans jonas , herbert marcuse ) . whether he succeeds this depends upon how one understands lineage intellectual development , how account any thinking appears new . wolin excellent providing parallel complementary ideas milieu which each " children " lived worked . he gifted eye similar potentially influential observations arguments ; whether means he explained finished product represented each title subjects ' works , distinct question . i'm glad read wolin -- it time worth spending . there numerous proofreading errors (' it ' instead ' if ' , . . ) unsettling mode writing heavily depends upon precision often complex distinctions , but gist his writing never doubt . my understanding heidegger philosophy specifically his relationship national socialism , definitely enhanced . it wolin core use what i call " contagion theory , " gives me greatest pause both his analysis this volume overall utility his work . i found myself mentally summoning voice america fifties , asking " you ever , or you now ... " considering just how i should frame weigh by-now predictable wolin approach addressing thinkers whom he disapproves . disapproval it , far more than mere disagreement . give man his due : he thoughtful obviously bright . whether this means his " contagion " analysis substantively or even fatally flawed , me open question ... whether it would time well spent read yet his volumes .	-1

i love anthologies where i read * every single * item .. i bought this originally essay diane duane , one my favourite authors . i pleasantly surprised find i liked every single essay , even ones conflicting points view , even one poul anderson .. ( although i find one dryest ) . said , these all professional authors , so disease so often blights academic collections , i.e. wonderful ideas completely killed inedible prose , not present . subjects essays vary greatly ; there lots personal recollections reading tolkien first time , esther friesner talks how hot people pointed ears , orson scott card talks critical approaches tolkien ( it * fun *!) , ursula le guin talks rhythmic pattern tolkien prose . there essays : raymond feist , poul anderson , michael swanwick ( funny one ! ) , esther friesner , harry turtledove , terry pratchett , robin hobb , ursula le guin , diane duane , douglas anderson , orson scott card , charles de lint , lisa goldstein , glenn hurdling ( interviewing hildiebrant brothers ) , terri windling , two introductions karen haber george martin ( they get author most similar name tolkien .. ) . anyway , if you like fiction any these , you'll probably like essays .	1

krishnamurti works offer rare glimpse sacred without dogma or path . i surprised see many people reviewing this text seem little understanding what suggesting . not engaging " egomania " , instead he constantly inviting audience ( readers ) find out themselves rather than accept answer . idea reality beyond our thinking no means new one , but helps us see all hundreds thousands ways thought looked security -- which includes religion . someone ( i'm assuming christian ) challenged if we go beyond our intellect we simply believe santa claus or satan - which obviously not true . point believe nothing therefore find out reality oneself . back subject matter , k simple but profound teachings help serious individuals bring change necessary mankind face new challenges present day . i whole-heartedly recommend each every book	1

this thoroughly researched mostly fair-minded account rise 6 most important members bush war cabinet his first term . digging deep into their respective backgrounds , james mann clearly demonstrates how their life histories career experiences shaped their views favor american military dominance , process debunking many lunatic conspiracy theories pass mainstream criticism decision go war iraq conduct war . he also clearly shows just how silly those antiwar loons who pinned such high hopes colin powell pointing out both he richard armitage any rational definition war hawks who merely disagreed rest vulcans when how fight iraq , not whether . yet ..., yet .... though james mann no partisan hack , though he clearly made sincere effort fair unbiased , end his liberal bias seeped through . this shows up most clearly his first annoying , then unintentionally hilarious , finally just plain sad continual assumption worst motives vulcans . when facts available mr. mann sticks them , even taking time debunk some more idiotic conspiracy theories , but when facts absent , mr. mann continually falls into trap assuming venal motives same people he just defended only marginally loonier accusations . saddest thing i am sure mr. mann completely unaware it , would probably respond confused stare if i tried point this out him . he just wouldn't able get it . area where he blinded liberal bias his continual attempts make big issue how people who once opposed democrat foreign policies designed spread democracy turned around supported republican foreign policies designed spread democracy . reason it turns out rather simple . democrat policies condemned because they usually failed , resulting more oppressive dictatorships , while republican policies praised because they usually worked , resulting real democracies ! this actually good microcosm liberal-conservative divide whole host issues : conservatism results-oriented ; liberalism isn't . what this means , sadly , we probably going forced rely more more conservative historians going forward , not because they unbiased , far it , but because they only historians enough self-awareness even attempt guard against their own biases .	-1

this messy book succeeds ( degree it so ) despite its flaws . some subjects covered well , some covered poorly , even where there coverage , discussions maddeningly inconsistent . first , good : author otto friedrich energetic finding many former residents berlin sources this work , some best parts book their colorful reminiscences their lost ruined city . friedrich also included interesting chapters social milieu time , particularly cultural scene : classical music , drama nascent motion picture industry . there some nice character sketches some leading artists era : lotte lenya , bertolt brecht various musicians . general , despite crazy-quilt nature coverage , friedrich best social history aspects berlin . now , bad : book very scattershot , mile wide , but mostly inch deep . example , discussion german movie industry time , although marlene dietrich emil jannings discussed , peter lorre , ernst lubistch f.w. murnau discussed only passing . among pictorial artists , george grosz covered discussed , but becker , nolde scores other artists get superficial or non-existent coverage . maybe it inevitable try discuss tangled political history weimar era rise nazis history berlin , but friedrich not professional historian , his weaknesses this area glaring . any reader even passing interest weimar era find far better accounts politics period than friedrich book . even if you grant he needed discuss political events day his work , there lamentable lack focus his political coverage , which mirrors overall unevenness this work . example , his descriptions combat streets freikorps communists immediate post-war period freshness vitality come testimony eyewitnesses , they give reader sense chaos became horrifyingly prevalent berlin . but his discussion germany policies toward payment reparations ( dawes plan young plan , etc . ) , best , superficial misleading . if you read this book , you might consider reading sections deal social history period just skipping ( or finding better sources ) political history .	-1

northanger abbey , jane austen satirizes what her her late 18th century readers gothic novel . even before ann radcliffe published enormously popular mysteries udolpho 1794 , novel sentiment all rage . such stories heroine likely cry , swoon , moan drop hat . radcliffe her book added other gothic ingredients fear , ghosts , haunted houses , other paranormal phenomena . austen looked down writers who their heroines engage such unseemly behavior even though she later treat seriously same trait sensibility sense sensibility . heroine northanger abbey catherine morland , who seems unlike what later prove typical austen protagonist . catherine start book much more closely allied " sense " half push-pull sense sensibility dichotomy all her works . she daughter prosperous clergyman who travels resort named bath , where she meets falls love henry tilney . there usual romantic plot complications austen novel which normally allow heroine attracted her male counterpart encounter suitable obstacles , all which neatly resolved after both parties undergo some serious soul searching which turn leads higher level moral vision . this case , austen great fun catherine first showing her full sense , then later shifting gears morphing her into standard " sensible " female gothic genre , finally whirling catherine back position reason logic . it takes half book before austen gets gothic satire which it well-known . when catherine arrives northanger abbey , she inexplicably affected conventional gothic trappings place . where earlier catherine would see occurrence might seemed spooky other more stereotyped gothic heroines but not so her , newer catherine now could see same eerie event filled unfounded terror . it only now austen makes clear target her barbed satire . she plainly disgusted other writers who purposefully filled empty heads their heroines gothic terror , but when she same , it excusable since satire , not stereotype , her aim . later , catherine grasp sense returns she able exonerate her own mind general tilney suspected charge murder his wife . end novel , reader introduced theme sense versus sensibility or unstructured emotion versus stifling reason . catherine morland , later nearly all austen female protagonists , austen suggests choose two extremes , one might seek middle ground so each one complement , rather than supplement other . there simply too many examples extremes who end badly austen works one ignore her implied advice .	1

this one best books i read subject creativity later life . i recommend it heartily . dr. cohen , m.d. amp ; h.d. become acknowledged leader this field his brilliant synthesis his 25 years experience working older adults geriatric physician creativity researcher . quot ; we need new frame reference which picture ourselves growing recognize how influence inner resources life circumstances present us opportunities revive our lives meaningful satisfying ways , quot ; cohen maintains . his experience his patients his studies aging creativity arts led him revise erik erikson model adult development later years . he divided erikson final stages generativity amp ; integrity into four developmental phases which he claims shape way our creative energy grows way we express it . each phase , he says , shaped our chronological age , our history , our circumstances . each phase characterized changes how we view experience life combined psychological , emotional intellectual sense . four phases : 1 . midlife reevaluation/quest phase 2 . liberation phase ( formerly called retirement ) 3 . late-life summing-up phase 4 . encore phase if we look beyond age markers retirement liberation phase search , instead , underlying developmental phase here , we find it defined kind personal liberation combined life experience lifts inhibitions gives us courage ignore social conventions restrict our creative expression . this liberation phase creative endeavors shaped added energy new degree personal freedom comes both psychologically within us externally through retirement . our creative juices may mobilized thought " if not now , when ? " people tend feel pretty comfortable themselves this time , knowing if they should make mistake it won't undo image others them , more importantly , it won't undo image they themselves . this psychological emotional understanding provides new context experimentation , retirement often provides new feeling finally free time try something new . both these inner outer elements liberating additive . this new sense available time personal liberty later life , combined significant life experience , produces new feelings freedom , courage , confidence commonly described men women advanced age . here , too , contrary negative stereotypes , feeling more free allows older individuals experiment , take risk , try something new . most us , we head into our sixties , become more comfortable who we . if we make mistake while trying something new , it doesn't shatter our self-image . so while someone his twenties may not dare take art class fear looking incompetent , doing something unfamiliar , person his forties or beyond much less concerned appearances , more interested experimenting new ways learn . cohen research underscores adventurous nature adults this liberated phase development . his investigations show older adults who not handicapped extenuating circumstances such poor health or financial constraints -- just venturesome their younger counterparts . this greater freedom courage helps explain why throughout history so many older adults their late sixties , seventies or beyond assumed role shapers shakers society . one thinks socrates , copernicus , titian , montaigne , goethe , rembrandt , newton , einstein , nelson mandela , simone de beauvoir , may sarton , eleanor roosevelt , people who rose greatness their later years . advancing years late life , what cohen calls encore stage , there desire -- developmental urgency , really -- affirm life number ways . it might through completing creative work , or resolution longstanding problem , statement waiting said , or right thing hold years . encore phenomenon taps inner pressure many feel or say something before it too late . phrase applies strongly field music , reminding us how many noted musical achievements come late or end musicain or composer career or life cycle -- like late works verdi , liszt , stravinsky . this time advancing age , which creative expression shaped desire make strong , lasting contributions personal or community level , affirm life , take care unfinished business , celebrate one own contribution . this phase typically occurs among those their eighties or older . multidisciplinary dr. cohen cites some fascinating biological studies brain reveal one early fifties late seventies there actually increase both number length branches individual brain cells different parts brain involved higher intellectual functioning ( cohen , . 79 ) these branching changes compensate brain cell loss occur over time . they also give further evidence platicity or modifiabilty brain it ages . something even more interesting these neuro-biological findings they directly correspond timewise unfolding above human potential phases pointing possible biological connection changes human development second half life . these human potential phases combine elements age-based developmental stages described erikson greater fluidity life transitions we experience today . sometimes we might experience phase sync others our age , but not always , age occurrence varies . sometimes they co-exist , intersect , even synergize or combine way adds even greater energy mix . significance these human potential phases they set state new creative thrust different points our lives . our awareness these phases help close gap recognizing our potential acutually harnessing it . knowing natural course development bring us closer tapping our creative potential different times provide much needed measure confidence or faith which we sometimes need begin , change or energize our creative efforts . i only scratched surface this book , but this summary should sufficient indicate its importance . i recommend everyone interested new discoveries human behavior , creativity longevity read it . -john-raphael staude , h.d. proteus60@aol.co	1

dr. williams studies women marine corps men nursing discuss what it like gender minority occupation . her most important point experience differs based upon biological sex . if women male-dominated field it rough not mean men female dominated field it same way . what came across most directly me how much gender still matters . if this book , dr. williams writes men choose avoid nursing whereas male military leaders actively prevent women entering field . moreover , gender complex . female marines see their femininity strength , but male marines see same quality substandard . male nurses get called doctor because patients simply can't fathom idea male nurse . fact , some patients say men practice " male nursing " because idea still seems so novel oxymoronic them . unfortunately , continued reality violence against women documented : male nurses noted male doctors throw things female nurses . i scandalized ! first , i surprised this sociology text so many psychological underpinnings . then again , two disciplines highly interrelated . still , freudian idea earliest memories parental practices affects everything may rub some readers wrong way . author clearly feminist not just some neutral observer . i support women rights , so didn't bother me . however , other readers may indict her " agenda . " me , however , pointing gender inequality legitimate aim . both her discussions nursing marines mentioned military often . thus , i am surprised she not directly cite feminist military scholar cynthia enloe . book starts off saying , " same way studying transgendered people tells us lot mainstream gender , so studying female marines male nurses tell us gender workplace over all . " i would argue transgendered people not studied enough , especially they deal employment settings . i hope more scholars take project . my biggest critique this book how lesbians lesbophobia mostly ignored . author notes heterosexual male nurses go out their way announce their sexual orientation gay male nurses may not receive advantages their straight counterparts . she also mentions gay men expelled military . however , huge numbers lesbians get expelled military too . because this book published 1989 , dr. williams not benefit numerous books printed 1990s spoke lesbian oppression military . still , gay rights activist urvashi vaid noted discrimination against women specifically lesbians longstanding feminist issue . dr. williams doesn't even state military discriminatory policies may why women inclusion marine corps taken given . dr. williams ' erasure here quite problematic . dr. williams quotes several men who say they not money attend medical school thus they became nurses . i don't buy one bit ! you get loans med school if you grades . getting into medical school difficult anybody . undergraduate nursing courses don't stress premedical curriculum way science departments . getting into medical schools such intense weeding process argument informants present here cannot possibly true . start , dr. williams confesses finding female marines talk much easier than finding male nurses . i know it taboo rank oppressions , but i wish author spoken how male femininity punished society more than female masculinity . parents discipline girly boys laugh off tomboyishness . women wear pants , but men punished wearing dresses . thus , maybe men punished more entering nursing than women who enter marine corps . i enjoyed this book , just i everything dr. williams writes . she insightful promising academic . gender radicals traditionalists should investigate what she say	-1

gershom scholem transformed kabbalah into acceptable academic discipline . today many writers/scholars/professors follow his footsteps ( e.g. wolfson idel ) . he , no doubt , us great service . it should noted , however , he historian -- neither scientist nor kabbalist . he appears faithfully presented kabbalistic doctrines , teachnings , etc . middle ages onward . nonetheless , reader should sensitive certain lack scientific viewpoint one hand mystical/experiential knowledge orientation other -- all his works . said , this wonderful book , one his best ( after " major trends jewish mysticism " ) . if you like this book , i'd recommend you also read , " jewish gnosticism-merkabah mysticism-and talmudic tradition . " work here illuminates many main kabbalistic concepts regarding godhead , including shekinah ( god presence or immanance god , which female ) , sephiroth ( emanations god ) , zaddik ( righteous person ) , etc . his voluminous entry jewish encyclopedia kabbalah also published stand-alone volume simply called , " kabbalah . " this work highly recommended it covers lots ground including major kabbalists . any serious student kabbalah find present work necessary addition his/her repertoire . my favorite quote this book page 139 where he quotes great maggid mezerich : " tsaddikim make god , if one may phrase it thus , their unconscious . " rabbi dov baer mezhirech ( great maggid ) or torah ( korets 1804 ) . 115b jerusalem 1956	-1

' swann love ' tells story . swann how he fell love one odette d'crecy , woman not his class who seduces him then breaks his heart . ' place-names : name ' we read slightly older marcel , his first attempts winning heart gilberte , daughter . swann . my favorite image swann way comes ' place names ' - image odette d'crecy strolling down avenue acacias alone , which proust includes his diatribe against death elegance . purpose writing search lost time recover his forgotten memories , proust tale not told series interconnected events , but collection interwoven memories - some them incomplete . [ short novella , ' swann love ' , contained novel exception - though still told internalized perspective , . swann . ] this format , description trumps plotline dialogue . his descriptions - tapestries cathedrals , child longing his mother , beauty words pain falling love - first rate . i found many times reading this book lot like looking great painting , or sunset - soothing , [ also exception ' swann love ' , where i found myself completely aggravated . swann hating odette . author calm you but also create characters capable arousing passionate anger must great . ] swann way highly recommended .	1

pollan taps into almost universal wish -- doing something else living . his strength here , his previous books , cheerleader . everyone wants told , " go ahead , you it , " pollan tells us just . since he defines second acts so broadly ( couple who decide buy second home country , instance ) , nearly everyone considered candidate second act . he outlines steps you should take before taking leap . decide just what it you want don't want , determine what financial family support you need , etc . making orderly exercise out it , it seems more attainable . pollan good organizing us putting positive spin doing something risky frightening most us . i disagree him one point , asking family members money . he says your family wants you happy , if they planning leaving you money their , instance , you should tell them you need it now . or , if you don't willing wealthy grandparents , ask siblings or parents loan . this sounds like mistake me , but maybe pollan knows better . it would also nice summary steps end book . if you thinking second act ( who isn't ) , you could probably figure out pollan steps your own , but it nice them organized you friendly mentor cheering you .	-1
john searle philosopher philosopher . he also scrupulously honest fault . when reading him , one never stop wonder whether he really believes what he saying . present work , " construction social reality " ( csr ) " no exception . lucid , cogent , packed insights , csr vintage searle -- thinker who just seems get better better age . nowadays one no more ignore searle than could medieval thinker ignore aristotle , or modern thinker ignore kant . when i begin writing any philosophical subject , i always check see whether searle close . csr offers most perspicuous account " social facts " or " institutional facts " any work i know , except , perhaps , chapter 5 searle earlier work , " intentionality . " i would recommend anyone interested subject read chapter together csr . focus chapter 5 " background . " searle develops this notion great length csr , especially chapter 6 . ( great strength csr logical progression topics one chapter next . ) idea background around least since husserl heidegger , key element heidegger analysis " time . " sure , searle not slavishly follow heidegger ; two thinkers very different takes what intentionality . ( especially lucid analysis difference searle heidegger found hubert dreyfus ' classic introduction heidegger , " being-in-the-world . " ) but anyone who second thoughts running headlong into thicket heideggerian prose hardly better than start searle . after all , when we're doing philosophy , it always good idea understand problem we're trying solve , questions we're trying answer . heidegger doesn't make it easy this . searle . not searle perfect . like most philosophers , he doesn't always resist urge engage speculative metaphysics . this he early csr . example , he writes : " since our investigation ontological , i.e. , how social facts exist , we need figure out how social reality fits into our overall ontology , i.e. , how existence social facts relates other things exist . we make some substantive presuppositions how world fact order we even pose questions we trying answer . we talking how social reality fits into larger ontology , but order , we describe some features larger ontology . " ( csr , 5-6 . ) yes , we make presuppositions . but here one point which searle heidegger differ ; i'm inclined side heidegger . we don't really get clear what our presuppositions ; , fact , it doubtful we ever . when we think we , we invariably get entangled speculative venture . whole foundationalist notion we must begin " clear distinct ideas " rings bit archaic nowadays . searle tries achieve clarity accepting incontrovertible axioms which , him , mark out boundaries any human cognitive enterprise . listen searle : " truth , us , most our metaphysics derived physics ( including other natural sciences ) . many features contemporary natural science conception reality still dispute still problematic . . . but two features our conception reality not up grabs . they not , so speak , optional us citizens late twentieth early twenty-first century . it condition your educated person our era you apprised these two theories : atomic theory matter evolutionary theory biology . " ( csr , 6 . ) it true educated person must " apprised " these two theories . it doesn't follow however , one give them foundational significance which searle claims them . what matters not our metaphysics , but our presuppositions . , heidegger would insist , we can't get clear them appealing science . fact , science not interested our " conception reality " or ultimate origins things . if our presuppositions get way our ability science , we may change them part . but this doesn't mean we draw picture ultimate reality its totality order proceed science . again , this just not something scientists care . i submit searle analysis institutional facts go forward whether he committed naturalist or believer divine revelation . but then , again , none this matters reader who wants know how social reality put together . , this definitive source . searle long ago earned his status primus inter pares philosophical community . whether he much thinker everyone else less certain . age when muddled thinking deemed virtuous , most people learned all they know philosophy oprah winfrey , one must probably conclude searle always home among his own . he'll never invited appear daytime talk show . his credit , i'm confident he wouldn't accept invitation . i wish i could give csr ten stars instead five . aidan mcdowell	1

first , clear couple things up : 1851 edition pearl great price published independently followers joseph smith england -- after he died , you understand ( 1844 ) . he couldn't possibly telling two different stories 1823 1851 because 1851 he dead . original pogp actually pamphlet put together people england who wanted remember some joseph smith teachings . i haven't actually read original document so i can't know if words " angel nephi " appear there " man truth " claims , but if they he lucky enough read them , then he should enough scholar know stacks stacks other sources attesting joseph smith testimony regarding his moroni visitation . " angel nephi " first edition independent missionary pamphlet safely seen simple typo ethusiastic printer . 2 ) joseph smith convicted " glass looking , fortune telling or prophesying " ? yes he . yes god forbid israelites deuteronomy fortune telling , but what those two things each other ? just because some local preachers tried persecuting smith under catch-all law 1826 mean he really something so terrible if he broke fortune telling commandment law moses ( 2000 . . ) ? didn't jesus say him law moses away ? even so , i believe fortune telling looked still wrong ( see peter book acts ) but wasn't what joseph smith doing or convicted under catch-all law my mind -- he prophecying , something may no no under some 1826 law , but a-ok lord . see bible . now , all i left say , see this book . i love it . it clears up lot bible fits into it quite nicely ( quite literally )	1

i really like way judy budnitz writes . i picked up flying leap years ago hooked . she one those authors when i go bookstore i look up see if anything new released . i don't know if she everyone though . her stories tend highly . . . imaginative . they almost like fairy tales , allegories may or may not deeper meaning . honest , i've never really looked . her writing just so rich full flavor i tend just devour stories sitting not think them later . her writing matured " nice big american baby " darker feeling than flying leap . i would even argue it darker than her novella , " if i told you once , " which its dark parts , but really straddles space flying leap baby . my favorite story far this collection " saving face " story two people living imaginary authoritarian regime ruled benign prime minister . perhaps it sign her maturation author ( or perhaps me reader ) i keep this story percolating my head going over themes true love , devotion , happenstance , self play this story . it really very very good . " visitors " also nice diversion wherein she uses interesting flash-cut narrative routine never gets boring or staid due fact after each transition you left wondering what new bizarre twist dialogue or scenery she going appear . you really can't go wrong budnitz book so if you looking something interesting read i would highly recommend her .	1

i fortunate study george burt when he teaching university michigan school music late seventies early eighties . just before he left teach rice university , he taught course film music i fortunate attend . david raksin few other film composers came spoke us their scores films we watched some sequences ( obviously , laura one them ) . this book came later i am sure burt used it his teaching rice . this book emphasizes works hugo friedhofer , alex north , david raksin , leonard rosenman , but they used illustrate points burt wants make rather than study composers works themselves . i remember burt emphasized music film not something added it anymore than music accompanying theme fugue separate it any material way . , what screen what score provides form counterpoint fuse into whole . neither music nor film complete or effective without other . if you watch films this mind , you notice how some handle music so effectively , some less well , some just awful use music ( this apart - but contributing factor - success film " work " ) . this book came out before digital computerized equipment used film today , but musical aspects spot i am sure technical considerations synchronization so forth still matter great deal . means ease integration doesn't change difficulty conception or composition . there six chapters : 1 ) story thing : music vital role , should film music heard ?, contrapuntal aspect , associative power music . 2 ) characterization : individual people , groups people , symbolic meanings , emotional context , ambient time place , source music3 ) emphasizing dramatic line : musical accents , missing beat or pulse , pacing4 ) sequence unit : best years our lives ( homecoming scene ) , laura ( apartment scene ) , east eden ( climactic scene)5 ) sound function when music absent : matter fact dialogue , psychological containment , acoustic space , moments anguish , telling quality ambient sound , question realism6 ) practical matters human element : spotting process , timings , synchronization , generalized compositional approaches , orchestration orchestra , synthesizer , music mix dubbing . i think this music invaluable composers arrangers wanting working film , tv , even commercials . however , i also think those wanting direct produce these works would benefit reading through this material . sure , there music examples someone not trained reading music find impossible , but examples not critical understanding points text . they add depth , but points made words text . anyone interested this topic film buff or general reader find their appreciation film music greatly enhanced . enjoy ! recommended	1

connie willis interesting writer this interesting book , page-turner well . it very good read . but i some misgivings . i agree this not your typical " sci-fi " work , but neither , reviewer mentioned , it well threshed out historical fiction , such neal stephenson gives us baroque cycle . other words , willis doesn't exactly transcend any genre here . rather , she mixes several together way not completely satisfactory . ironically , what rather bothers one how entertaining this book . it , like much willis fiction , heavily dependent droll , wodehousian humour . this used perfect effect works such say nothing dog . it used perfect effect here beginning where mrs. gaddison , example , much like bertie wooster aunt agatha , serves perfect comic foil droll sort wit --- but then deaths start piling up , both eras , it isn't really until we near end dunworthy becomes ill , these wry lines situational comedies ended - characters ' deaths . there distinct literary dissonance book one smirking or tittering until final , harrowing chapters . all this said , book some finer points , finest which willis evocations medieval landscape ; i reminded bit singrid unset kristin lavransdatter ( which , those who want real historical fiction this sort , definitely place turn ) . book truly manage convey christina rossetti picture " bleak midwinter long ago " quoted beginning " book two " . so , what verdict ? - doomsday book good , engrossing read , if rather flawed literary sense . i'd recommend it anyone who wants something more than mere page turner but something less than true literary fiction - , kristin lavransdatter where cast your eye .	-1

this book reasonable job overview reich life most his early work , though it fails thorough example sharaf " fury earth " . author gives his impressions reich work , philosopher discourse comparative review reich behavioral findings they relate modern ideas psychiatry psychology ... matter he reasonable job . however , what bothered me terrible misrepresentation reich biophysical research . corrington either not know , or knows but some reason fails discuss , multitude controlled studies undertaken both during reich lifetime after his death , which verified more controversial aspects his biological orgone energy discoveries . so , example , reader learn nothing : 1 ) demeo 1970s university kansas replication reich cloudbuster research , showing positive results , nor demeo global cross-cultural study " saharasia " which used standard anthropological evidence prove global accuracy reich sex-economic findings origins violence . 2 ) double-blind controlled studies . mueschenich . gebauer university marburg early 1980s , " psycho-physiological effects reich orgone accumulator " , verifying exactly reich original findings human physiological response orgone accumulator . also not mentioned , additional replication study orgone accumulator . hebenstreit university vienna .

i really expected enjoy this - i love dams ' dorothy martin series . i usually read first two books before making up my mind series , but this so bad i didn't heart read next . best part book evocation time place : turn-of-the century indiana perspective young swedish immigrant working maid studebakers . hilda one four johansson children sent america find themselves place then earn passage rest family . overall story rather flimsy . hilda deeply concerned immigrant , almost any immigrant , blamed when member prominent family murdered . when she learns police left patrol wagon question chinese guest notre dame , mr. kee , hilda decides she only she save him . she arrives notre dame after exhausting walk learn what lazy less righteous us would guessed ourselves : 1 . police gone ( they head start they riding wagon , pete sake ! ) 2 . priests notre dame could more him than she could , i.e. provide alibi . but very contrived sub-plot , mr. kee flees before police arrive so hilda save him later . her duties maid don't leave her much opportunity investigation . servants ' gossip network supposed hilda advantage , but she finds killer dumb , stupid , luck , during unnecessary piece folly . killer actions little hard credit : i don't want spoil story , but means opportunity important motive . i'm lot trouble figuring out how killer managed pull off crimes . why would killer so stupid confront hilda under disadvantageous circumstances ? my guess dams some scenes her head then connected them best she could often awkward seques . my last problem book hilda attitudes toward us . miserable experience immigrants major theme this book , i don't doubt lot immigrants hard lot , but why , experienced hellish american life , she her siblings trying bring rest family here ? wouldn't you think they'd saving get back sweden ? i don't expect fairy-tale , but portrayal hilda seems incomplete .	-1
i just read this book enjoyed it thoroughly . however , title somewhat misleading , this not conventional biography . other than few chapters her childhood early education , book arranged " theme " chapters , each focussing particular person or aspect her life , illustrated , heavily annotated , letters poems related theme . i ended book more questions her life than i beginning . many them barely addressed book , or just hinted . perhaps book intended readers who already very familiar biographical details . just one example , author mentions several times eye problem led one emily rare trips away her home treatement boston . i kept thinking sooner or later some further details this eye problem would revealed , but there never more than few widely scattered sentences it . perhaps there isn't enough evidence able conjecture nature problem , but author doesn't even seem think it important enough detail require weighing evidence . likewise her mother long illness , which played role emily withdrawal world , mentioned but its nature not discussed , other than mention she paralyzed near end her life . she suffer stroke ? she lucid ? since emily her primary caregiver , it would seem these details might bear her own emotional state during years this illness would warrant least some speculation . even emily own final illness remains mystery . we learn her sister blamed it ill treatment received her sister-in-law , her doctor attributed it " nerves " . however , other hints , it seems progessively debilitating illness . there never much paragraph entire book which speculates nature this fatal illness or how much she might incapacitated first attack june 1884 her death may 1885 . " nerves " seems me insufficient explanation death poet after illness eleven months . we sure fainting spell related final illness ? she ill entire eleven months ? how long she bedridden ? author doesn't even pose these questions . book 821 pages , there no index entry " illness " . " death [ ed ] " 7 widely scattered brief entries , one which footnote , one which 13-sentence entry how her death affected her brother , one which text her obituary three which describe her funeral(on pages 273 , 575 667 , show how scattered they ) . seventh entry refers her obituary , but seems mistake , i find no mention her death or obituary page cited . book especially good life her brother austin , also good her father . her mother sister remain mysterious , probably because they not much more exposed public scrutiny than emily herself . it obvious her sister nearly much recluse emily , or least perceived such their neighbors . such scattered book , there inevitably good deal repetition details . three mentions emily funeral cited above , example , mostly identical . poems also quoted part or their entirety multiple times . there index poems pages which they discussed , which useful understanding context some these , although author acknowledges dating poems presents many problems . there chronology beginning book , which really closest there temporal ordering poet life . i would suggest photocopying it using it bookmark , because there little chronological ordering , even within chapters times . i found myself asking such things , " this before her brother marriage or after ? her father still alive when this happened ? " matter fact , because i didn't chronology front me , i surprised realize , when i almost finished book , emily father still alive during period her most intense literary activity . after early chapter devoted her father life , he not often mentioned again , i somehow remained impression he died much earlier her life . much i enjoyed this book , i am left wanting book fill gaps . however , i learned enough partisanal nature her biographers wary choosing one .	-1

i recall time , i worked large parallel unix debugger , only slowly collected facts scraps necessary knowledge progress . i always wondered , why not single book written , which would solely devoted architecture , design implementation symbolic debuggers ? i saw this book announced , my expectations high . could this help organizing my knowledge debuggers , collected so far semi confidential industry reports or white papers , 3-4 dissertations , several implementations , plus some 10-15 conference papers vague descriptions implementations , claims spectacular achievements or mere theoretical ideas ? no , unfortunately this not so . this book , or rather " booklet " very incomplete . it literally not told me any single detail which i would not known already . example , missing description very standard unix interface control hold process . since this not scientific book providing more generic foundations process tracing ( such tracking very long time running programs , replay techniques , generating snapshots etc . etc . ) than i would least expect solid practice orientation . this should include complete discussion several assemblers typical architectures , because they provide sometimes completely different means implementing breakpoints , watchpoints or support threads . many cases debugger must , or supported cooperating compiler . several interesting ideas implemented back ends , which may greatly help supporting breakpoints , finding function prologues , dealing exceptions asynchronous signals . i also miss specifications good comparison two most common formats holding symbolic information , stabs dwarf ! etc . etc ., this list missing facts issues could go . usually i call book like this one " blah blah novel .

following in-depth review this book . but very abbreviated version : it good book few shortcomings . good read though some great strategies america . critique charles pena new book american strategy face al qaeda offers solid plan defeating america enemy , but suffers few shortcomings . overall , however , plan focusing al qaeda , using special forces capture kill leadership while simultaneously removing motivation behind terrorist attacks solid one . our nation leaders would well read this book take heed mr. pena advice . writing editing comments before delving into mr. pena arguments , there few shortcomings writing editing book we should cover . first few chapters rely too heavily quotes political leaders , sometimes five or more direct quotes single page . while this works well evidence , reader would better served one or two quotes getting directly point , backed up additional cites footnotes or endnotes , followed analysis quote . it takes nothing away mr. pena analysis , but would serve make first few chapters more readable . second quibbling point mr. pena tortured analogy al qaeda quantum physics . mr. pena spends several paragraphs describing wave/particle duality light before going talk organizational structure al qaeda . but while light both wave particle same time , al qaeda not both structured hierarchical organization distributed nodal network same time . al qaeda simply distributed nodal network , only true leadership occurs ideological leadership . again , this not affect mr. pena analysis al qaeda , but it serve confuse reader this tortured analogy . use other analogies , especially focusing eastern theology , somewhat better analogy itself shorter . but i still cannot understand how al qaeda composed both yin yang . when using analogies general , it would seem better compare something not generally understood ( al qaeda ) something commonly understood reader ( not usually eastern religions or quantum physics ) . but course all these objections minor we should move more depth discussion mr. pena analysis al qaeda american policy . america focus mr. pena book contains one major assumption upon which whole book argumentation based . assumption al qaeda foremost threat america . while some may take this doctrine , others not , mr. pena not sufficient job backing up this assumption . let us take , example , al qaeda attacks directly american interests last two decades : 1 . world trade center - 1993 ( unsuccessful)2 . african embassies -19983 . uss cole - 20004 . 9/11 - 2001all them course devastating reprehensible , but only one effect doing real damage america 9/11 . yet , five years later , truly not much changed america . change greater new york itself , but five years later they still haggling over wtc site . while 3,000 deaths attack tragic , it pales comparison more than 42,000 die every single year auto accidents america . al qaeda may only group out there actually wherewithal attack america , but even their most devastating attack no means brought america down or even threatened so . it far more devastating effect not immediate deaths or impact economy , but changes it produced america foreign policy , which generated additional support our enemies far fewer friends america . truth al qaeda not actual threat america or american way life , but they threat american power influence world , bring fight american soil . such , they deserve hunted down destroyed , but we should so context broader campaign increase america power influence . america today most powerful nation earth ever seen . only current international threat still comes nuclear arsenals russia china , which only groups able actually destroy america itself . but we successfully used deterrence minimize risk those countries . biggest threat america today , through bad leadership , we misuse our power influence cause it decline . this would allow other state non-state entities arise threaten not only our dominance world affairs , but our very country . thus , while it good consider america positive influence world , we should look america power influence world affairs strong protector our freedoms our democracy . while many mr. pena suggestions excellent defeating al qaeda , he seems believe this conflict more protection " homeland " than protection american supremacy . it not " homeland " al qaeda after , it american supremacy itself . yielding supremacy al qaeda may temporarily protect homeland , but it lead lessening american interests abroad . successful presidents over past century recognized , peaceful prosperous world leads peaceful prosperous america . i discuss some strategies defeating al qaeda while simultaneously maintaining expanding american power influence later , but first let us discuss al qaeda itself more depth . nature beast mr. pena excellent job stating what al qaeda goals ambitions . he also reiterates it not america al qaeda hates , but america effects islamic world . this true , not stated often enough . al qaeda not some evil demon pits we must slay goodness world . al qaeda instead group human beings ambition ideology back up ambition . their ambition reform ( revolution ) muslim world return it " pure " state when it led caliphs . their ideology anyone who interferes this ambition not true muslim so obstacle their path . they also less stringent regard either their own lives or lives others , especially non-muslims , world . these ambitions ideologies put al qaeda into direct conflict america , which its power influence acts either maintain status quo middle east ( all assorted authoritarian unpleasantness ) or push increased democracy improved freedoms ( we , rather unsuccessfully , iraq ) . so al qaeda united states simply two groups different ambitions ideologies compete power world stage . america already vast power influence while al qaeda attempting gain its own power influence . because power differential involved this competition , one only rational choices al qaeda accomplish its ambitions conduct asymmetrical warfare . asymmetrical warfare term used often connotation vietnam describe how small , mobile , ideologically committed force used surprise , terror , propaganda defeat largest military power world . just vietnam , al qaeda not militarily defeat united states ( nor could it ) . they must simply win propaganda campaign . they use terrorism accomplish this . this because every atrocious act they commit , united states ( or their own local governments ) cracks down . these crack downs usually accompany oppression some sort because terrorists mixed among local population . oppression breeds resentment creates more recruits al qaeda who then uses those recruits more atrocious acts . thus cycle continues , al qaeda strengthening every iteration . so mr. pena absolutely right saying our continued presence middle east , especially our occupation iraq , merely leads additional recruits . but what mr. pena not focus enough al qaeda essentially guerilla group . their genius they one first such groups truly go global . while most guerillas local fighters battling local governments , al qaeda global organization battling global superpower . their ability go global aided international transport communication . understanding al qaeda guerilla organization helpful though because al qaeda relies popular support . without friends associates hide them , or without friendly local mosques recruit , al qaeda would not able function . mr. pena absolutely right while leadership important , it this popular support must destroyed order organization cease functioning . crushing al qaeda while maintaining strong america mr. pena advice dealing al qaeda fairly simple : crush leadership remove motivation . this excellent advice fact practiced successfully before countries when non-state actors rise up challenge state . key here use both iron fist velvet glove . leadership crushed example all others not repeat their folly challenging state . same time , much what ideology demanding ( al qaeda case , withdrawal america middle east ) granted order take away motivation future rabble rousing . mr. pena correctly points out american policy middle east blatantly self serving revolves around oil . our need oil something we change ( good domestic policies ) , besides which , global market oil means we need not cozy up unsightly arab regimes . main complaint arab world america movements into iraq not america trying bring democracy into region but america only seeking iraqi oil . if america wishes quiet sympathy jihadist movement , then we need act upon our principles region . this not mean overthrowing every tin pot dictator ( or saddam hussein ) . it mean not supporting tin pot dictators just because they our tin pot dictators , however . if islamic governments elected , it means supporting those governments free democracies ( providing elections free subsequent quashing freedoms not occur ) , even if we not always agree their policies . principled america america far easier support far less easy attack . principled america would also work hard minimize abuses civil liberties . while we rightly condemn actions few abu graib , we not address systematic philosophy underlying system allowed such torture occur . large part systematic philosophy seen manifested guantanamo well . locking individuals up without charges years end policy tin pot dictators , should not policy united states . if we want world believe we stand freedom democracy , then we must practice what we preach . it separation our noble words our ignoble actions gives world pause leads hatred resentment america . we must follow our noble words noble actions insure our long term security . it may slightly hamper efforts short term , but our far more important long term goal victory over terrorists hearts minds world . while perhaps mr. pena not want delve too deeply into politics here , failing mention guantanamo , which one strongest arguments against america rallying cry al qaeda , shortsighted . mr. pena also absolutely correct advocating change our methods hunting al qaeda . we no longer live world warsaw pact . troops should shifted around our military should focus not submarines , b-2 bombers , new fangled fighter jets . instead , we should focus special forces able fight insurgencies . unlike mr. pena , i not believe this requires shrinkage personnel . i believe we must stay iraq because leaving it allow terrorists home back much like afghanistan . but we need shift cold war outlook military able deal modern threats non-state actors indigenous insurgencies . special forces good localized intelligence critical tracking down leadership al qaeda bringing them justice . while mr. pena correct their organization flexible adaptable , each time we make example one their leaders , it hopefully discourage others . this aspect our operation less important , however , because it very difficult dissuade martyrs . so while we should focus catching bin laden his ilk , our main focus should eliminating his basis popular support . conclusion while book contain some shortcomings , i not think i would like live mr. pena isolationist united states , mr. pena offer us hopeful way combating al qaeda . we must bring fight them . but we must define fight fight hearts minds islamic world . we not winning fight supporting arab autocrats or invading arab lands . instead , we need adopt principled foreign policy work rebuild our support not only around region but around world . doing so , we take away critical popular support al qaeda relies upon . combined operations destroy al qaeda leadership , this offers us best chance destroying al qaeda creating stronger america process	-1
